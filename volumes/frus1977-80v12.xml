                <p>The Department of State released today <ref target="frus1977-80v12"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>, 1977–1980,
                        Volume XII, Afghanistan</ref>.</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> subseries that
                    documents the most important foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter
                    administration. The focus of this volume is on the Carter administration’s
                    approach to events in Afghanistan during the buildup of the Soviet Union’s
                    presence in that country beginning in early 1978 and culminating in the large
                    scale invasion of Soviet troops at the end of 1979. Officials in the Carter
                    administration regarded Soviet actions as among the most flagrant violations of
                    international norms during the Cold War. The volume is arranged chronologically,
                    with the majority of documents concentrated around the crisis period during the
                    lead-up to the invasion, and during the aftermath, when the Carter
                    administration formulated a range of policy responses to challenge the Soviet
                    Union’s domination of Afghanistan. </p>
                <p>This compilation was compiled and edited by David Zierler. This PDF version of
                    the volume and press release are available on the Office of the Historian

                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    Government. The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the
                    responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of
                    Public Affairs, under the direction of the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans, researches, compiles,
                    and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first
                    promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection
                    and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These regulations,
                    with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department
                    of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy decisions and significant <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series
                    should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government. The statute also confirms the editing principles
                    established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy;
                    records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the
                    published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit
                    no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing
                    should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute
                    also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded. The editors are
                    convinced that this volume meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy decisions and significant
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic activity. It further
                    requires that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government en<pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>gaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support
                    cooperate with the Department of State historians by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the
                    preparation of this volume have been declassified and are available for review
                    at the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) in College
                    Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977–1979 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. The
                    Department’s central files for 1980–1981 will eventually be transferred to the
                    National Archives. Almost all of the Department’s decentralized office files
                    covering this period, which the National Archives deems worthy of permanent
                    retention, have been transferred to or are in the process of being transferred
                    from the Department’s custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the Jimmy Carter Presidential
                    Library and other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                    staff of the Carter Library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Carter Library include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related
                    documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments to a given document were in fact attached
                    to the paper copy of the docu<pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>ment in the
                    Carter Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>Documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to Washington
                    time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text,
                    except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes
                    and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
                    correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases
                    underlined in the original document are printed in italics. Abbreviations and
                    contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each volume. In
                    telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as <gloss target="#t_Secto_1">Secto</gloss>) is printed at the start of the text of
                    the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed in their
                    chronological place with headings, source notes, and the number of pages not
                    declassified. All brackets that appear in the original document are so
                    identified in the footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related docu<pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>ments printed in other volumes, describe key events, and
                    provide summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and
                    elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other
                    first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate
                    the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation of the series and declassification of records. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government, and
                    the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments. The declassification review of this volume, which began in 2013 and
                    was completed in 2017, resulted in the decision to withhold 3 documents in full,
                    excise a paragraph or more in 12 documents, and make minor excisions of less
                    than a paragraph in 162 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s policy toward
                    Afghanistan.</p>

                        Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> subseries that
                    documents the most important foreign policy issues of the administration of
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>. This volume focuses on
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy in response to the Soviet
                    intervention in Afghanistan, a process that began with Moscow’s growing
                    involvement in Afghan politics following the Communist revolution in April 1978
                    and culminating with the mass influx of Soviet military forces in December 1979.
                    Until the Communist coup that overthrew President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Mohammed Daoud Khan</persName>, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    diplomatic and strategic interest in Afghanistan was minor, and focused largely
                    on stanching the flow of illegal narcotics through that country. Prior to 1978,
                    Washington viewed Afghanistan as a relatively stable and non-aligned country
                    that did not figure prominently in the global Cold War competition. Accordingly,
                    Afghanistan was not a major focal point for the first year and a half of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration. By 1978, at
                    the first sign that Afghanistan may fall into the Soviet orbit, Washington’s
                    interest in Afghanistan increased dramatically.</p>
                <p>By the time Moscow launched a military takeover of the Afghan government at the
                    end of 1979, the Afghanistan crisis rose to the top of the President’s foreign
                    policy agenda as the administration sought ways to coerce the Soviets to
                    withdraw. In the days following the invasion, the President and his foreign
                    policy team adopted a triple-pronged strategy of diplomatic pressure, economic
                    sanctions, and covert aid to the <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin,</hi> the Afghan
                    resistance fighters, with the help of Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s policy laid the groundwork for what would become the
                    largest covert operation in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> history during
                    the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration, ending with
                    the withdrawal of the last Soviet forces from Afghanistan nearly a decade after
                    the invasion.</p>
                <p>Readers who wish to understand the broader context of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s policy in Afghanistan
                    should consult the chapter on Pakistan in <ref target="frus1977-80v19"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1977–1980, Volume XIX, South
                        Asia</ref>. Because of Pakistan’s close coordination with the United States
                    to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (due in large part to its
                    leaders’ fears that Moscow sought domination of Pakistan), this chapter is
                    indispensable for understanding Washington’s strategic interest in limiting
                    Moscow’s threat to the region, and its tactical coordination with Pakistan to
                    support Afghanistan’s anti-Soviet resistance movement. Readers should also

                <p>This volume documents the major foreign policy decisions taken by the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration in response to the
                    Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Documentation in this volume includes
                    memoranda; records of discussions within the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policymaking community as well as with foreign officials;
                    cables to and from <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic as well as
                    intelligence posts; and papers that set forth policy issues and options and that
                    show decisions or actions taken. The documentation emphasizes both the process
                    by which <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy developed and the major
                    consequences of its implementation.</p>
                <p>The most striking feature of this volume’s organization is chronological. Until
                    the spring of 1978 and from the standpoint of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy, Afghanistan was a relatively stable,
                    non-aligned country. Before then, events in Kabul rarely registered in the Oval
                    Office and the National Security Council, and cables to and from the Embassy and
                    the Department of State were relatively few and did not contain much of
                    high-level concern. It therefore follows that only a tiny percentage of this
                    volume’s documentation covers the first sixteen months of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> White House. But with the communist-led
                    overthrow of President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Khan</persName> during the
                    spring of 1978, and the obvious implications this had on the Cold War,
                    Washington’s concern and interest in the internal workings of Afghanistan grew
                    in lockstep with the Soviet Union’s political and ultimately military
                    intervention in that country. Beginning with telegram 3239 from Kabul, April 27,
                    1978, which reported that President Daoud was “gone completely and forever,” the
                    crisis in Afghanistan steadily rose in importance for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policymakers over the next year and a half. With relations
                    improving between the new Afghan regime and the Soviet Union throughout the
                    remainder of 1978, the Pakstani government grew concerned. Pakistan’s border
                    with Afghanistan, long a source of tension, now meant that any conflict could
                    draw Islamabad into direct confrontation with a military superpower. In August,
                    Pakistani President Muhammed <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia Ul-Haq</persName>
                    sought guarantees from Washington as a deterrent against what he considered <pb n="IX" facs="0010" xml:id="pg_IX"/>Soviet-backed Afghan encroachments on
                    Pakistani territory. By the end of the year, Pakistan’s fears of expanding
                    Soviet influence in Afghanistan were substantiated: Kabul and Moscow signed a
                    “friendship treaty” in December affirming economic, military, and political
                    cooperation. Meanwhile, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations
                    deteriorated sharply, from which they never recovered, in the wake of the
                    kidnapping and death of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Adolph
                        Dubs</persName>, who was abducted in February 1979 by Afghan extremists in
                    Kabul and eventually killed during a botched rescue attempt commanded by Afghan
                    and Soviet authorities. Shortly after this tragic incident <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> officials considered options to assist Afghan
                    insurgents opposed to the communist regime in Kabul. At this juncture, lethal
                    aid was considered too risky. A revolt against the regime was already underway
                    in the Afghan countryside, and Pakistan was increasingly tolerant of insurgent
                    activity along its border with Afghanistan, and with the destabilization of the
                    central government came increased likelihood that Moscow would resort to
                    military intervention. In July, Washington committed to a covert program to aid
                    Afghan insurgents by funneling communications equipment, non-lethal combat
                    materiel, and cash through Pakistan. It was a modest beginning to an operation
                    that would ultimately become the longest and largest in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> history to that point.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1979 the insurgency was threatening to depose the central
                    government in Kabul, and the Kremlin had lost confidence in the recently
                    ascended Afghan leader <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>.
                    Citing the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine, which held
                    that once a country had turned communist, Moscow would resolve to keep it in the
                    “revolutionary” camp, the Soviet leadership decided to execute a full political
                    and military takeover of Afghanistan. On December 25, 1979, Soviet forces
                    invaded the country and killed <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> in
                    Kabul at the Presidential Palace. Two days later President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> approved a new covert action to send
                    lethal aid to the Afghan <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi> insurgents, rebuked
                    the invasion in a strongly worded letter to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>, and undertook an array of diplomatic and economic
                    sanctions in consultation with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> allies to
                    protest Soviet policy.</p>
                <p>Just as the dearth of documentation covering 1977 and the first third of 1978
                    illustrate the unimportance of Afghanistan along the broad spectrum of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy, the brief period of the
                    immediate run-up and aftermath of the late-December Soviet invasion quickly
                    became one of the tensest periods of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> presidency. The documentation covering the period two
                    weeks prior and following the Soviet invasion accounts for approximately a
                    quarter of the entire volume; this portion comprises intelligence reports,
                    memoranda of conversation, and minutes of meetings which together show
                    Washington’s somewhat chaotic and reactive response to the crisis.</p>
                <p><pb n="X" facs="0011" xml:id="pg_X"/>As numerous documents in this volume
                    demonstrate, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> officials were well aware of
                    the possibility of a Soviet invasion at least a year before the actual event.
                    Documentation in the last half of the volume, covering 1980, is devoted almost
                    exclusively to the administration’s multi-layered policy challenging the Soviets
                    in Afghanistan. Although the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration’s stated goal was to make the Soviets regret the intervention,
                    and ultimately compel a withdrawal, this policy also had the immediate objective
                    of deterring the Soviets from threatening Pakistan. This portion of the
                    compilation shows close cooperation between Washington and Islamabad and a
                    consequent strengthening of the Afghan insurgency. The Soviets in turn protested
                    that they would leave Afghanistan once the United States ceased “meddling” in
                    that country’s internal affairs.</p>
                <p>By the end of the volume the documents show that this pattern had become
                    well-established. Following the immediate crisis atmosphere after the Soviet
                    invasion, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s attention
                    was once again drawn elsewhere; notably to the Iranian hostage crisis. Although
                    the compilation concludes with <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                    presidency, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy in Afghanistan should be
                    seen as a continuum into the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> era;
                    two volumes covering the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration and the first month of the Bush administration (at which point
                    Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan) should be consulted when they are
                    published. Together, readers should ultimately consult this trilogy of volumes
                    spanning three presidential administrations which will show a remarkable
                    continuity of policy and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> resolve across a
                    ten-year span.</p>

                    1977–1980, Volume XII, Afghanistan</p>
                <p>In preparation for this volume, the editors made extensive use primarily of
                    Presidential materials held in the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, Department
                    of State materials held in the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II) in College Park, Maryland; National Intelligence Council Files
                    held in the archives of the Central Intelligence Agency; the papers of Secretary
                    of Defense <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName>, housed at the
                    Library of Congress; the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration Intelligence Files, held in the National Security Council
                    archives, Washington, D.C.; and the Afghan War Collection held in the archives
                    of the Department of Defense, Washington, D.C. Of the presidential materials,
                    numerous collections proved to be valuable for this volume. As a general matter,
                    the most noteworthy organizational characteristic of Afghanistan-related
                    materials at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library is their wide dispersal
                    throughout the archive’s collections. Unlike many other countries or topic
                    areas, whose main holdings are largely confined to a relatively small number of
                    collections, significant documentation on Afghanistan can be found in over
                    twenty distinct collections in the Carter Library. This presents obvious
                    challenges to the researcher, because in many cases it is difficult to ascertain
                    why a particular document appears in one collection and not another.
                    Nonetheless, the broad distribution of Afghanistan materials throughout the
                    library’s archives speaks to the importance of complexity of the crisis of the
                    Soviet intervention as a “hot flash” in the global Cold War against the Soviet
                    Union. The intervention in Afghanistan had both strategic repercussions
                    requiring a worldwide diplomatic offensive and a local immediacy that
                    policymakers determined needed a covert response at the tactical level. This
                    guaranteed that broad swathes of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    foreign policy apparatus found itself involved with the crisis.</p>
                <p>The following are the most fulsome collections for Afghanistan, although readers
                    should consult below for a complete list of relevant collections at the Jimmy
                    Carter Presidential Library. Collections of a general nature which include the
                    greatest amount of Afghanistan material are: the National Security Affairs,
                    Brzezinski Material, Country File for Afghanistan; the National Security
                    Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Office File, Country Chron; and the <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> Donated Material
                    Collection. The three most important staff collections are: the National
                    Security Affairs, Staff Material <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> North/South File; the National Security Affairs, Staff
                    Material, Europe, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and East-West Bre<pb n="XVI" facs="0017" xml:id="pg_XVI"/>ment Subject File; and the National
                    Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, General <persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName> File. The National Security Council Institutional Files
                    contain a full record of the National Security Council’s cabinet-level meetings
                    on Afghanistan and related memoranda, which together show the development at the
                    highest levels of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration’s multi-pronged strategy to challenge the Soviet intervention.
                    The National Security Affairs, Staff Material, Office, Outside the System File
                    contains, as the name suggests, material deemed so sensitive that it was to be
                    closely held and not included in the regular framework of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>’s document transmission and filing system. The
                    National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, President’s Correspondence with
                    Foreign Leaders File contains several important letters to and from the
                    President to international leaders regarding the crisis in Afghanistan. The
                    National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Cables file contains telegrams
                    which were deemed sufficiently important to warrant <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s, and in some cases, the President’s attention. The
                    National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Trip File contains many
                    memoranda of conversation and related documents covering <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s diplomatic missions in the months
                    after the Soviet intervention. The Carter Presidential Papers, Plains File,
                    President’s Personal Foreign Affairs File contains documentation from which the
                    President drew to write his memoirs. This unique collection offers insight into
                    the issues <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> deemed significant as
                    he undertook to shape his own legacy as President. The National Security
                    Affairs, Brzezinski Material, President’s <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                    Daily Brief File is a clearinghouse for the short intelligence reports the
                    President received every morning. Because of the highly charged and fluid nature
                    of the crisis in Afghanistan, these reports provide a real-time picture of the
                    President’s decision making based on the latest and most sensitive intelligence
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration Intelligence
                    Files, officially part of the Carter Library’s collection but housed in
                    Washington D.C., are the main source for meeting notes and minutes of the
                    Special Coordinating Committee’s (<gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>)
                    discussions on Afghanistan. Because the covert action to support the Afghan <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi> was at the heart of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration’s policy in Afghanistan,
                    this collection is arguably the most vital in the entire volume. Other important
                    documentation originating with the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> can be
                    found in the Carter Library’s collection, National Security Affairs, Staff
                    Material, Office File.</p>
                <p>Of the Department of State materials, four collections proved to be especially
                    rich in material for this volume. The Central Foreign Policy File is a
                    repository for telegrams between the Department of State and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic posts. The cable traffic out of
                    Kabul provides an extensive and oftentimes dramatic narrative of events on the
                    ground there, particularly during two episodes: the death of Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>; and <pb n="XVII" facs="0018" xml:id="pg_XVII"/>the decision-making surrounding a disillusioned Soviet
                    soldier who sought refuge, and possibly defection, from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Embassy Kabul’s reporting was also the
                    starting point for the Department’s worldwide diplomatic initiative to protest
                    Moscow’s intervention in Afghanistan. The lot file for Under Secretary of State
                    for Political Affairs <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David Newsom</persName>
                    contains many important memoranda between the Department’s highest ranking
                    officials and their counterparts at other <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    government agencies; the Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research,
                    Intelligence Liaison File contains key documents which detail highly sensitive
                    cooperation of the United States with third-party countries to assist the covert
                    action. The Executive Secretariat Sensitive and Super Sensitive File contains
                    key memoranda on Afghanistan involving Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. Finally, the lot file for <persName corresp="#p_SMD_1">Marshall Shulman</persName>, Special Adviser to the
                    Secretary of State on Soviet Affairs, offers several important documents which
                    show the complex diplomatic challenges facing the United States in light of the
                    Soviet Union’s aggression in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>The donated papers of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold
                        Brown</persName> contain several documents included in this volume which
                    show that the Department of Defense was a crucial player in the policymaking
                    process.</p>
                <p>Of the documents from the Central Intelligence Agency, two main types of records
                    proved most useful. The general records of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and its offices, including the National Intelligence Council,
                    contain intelligence reporting from the field, as well as related memoranda
                    originating at <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> headquarters. The second
                    type of record is “finished intelligence” meant for distribution outside the
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> based on intelligence deemed
                    sufficiently reliable to be used in the formulation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy. Together, these types of records demonstrate
                    that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> reported accurately on both the
                    growing political crisis in Afghanistan and consequent likelihood of Soviet
                    intervention, as well as on the impact of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy on Soviet decision making.</p>
                <p>The Afghan War Collection, housed in the Department of Defense, exists as a
                    matter of bureaucratic happenstance. In the case of certain materials related to
                    Afghanistan, the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> did not maintain a
                    complete archive of its historic materials in the way other agencies, as is the
                    practice of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> or the presidential
                    libraries, for example. What can be found in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> holdings is a collection of documents which were never
                    transferred to the National Archives. This collection contains a wealth of
                    vitally important documents for this volume—documents which in many cases were
                    not found elsewhere.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                    decisions and actions, the editors have identified key documents regarding major
                    covert actions and intelligence activities. The following note will provide
                    readers with some organizational context on how covert actions and special
                    intelligence operations in support of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    foreign policy were planned and approved within the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government. It describes, on the basis of declassified
                    documents, the changing and developing procedures during the <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon,
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Presidencies.</p>

                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> administration’s concern over
                    Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted the new National Security Council to
                    authorize, in <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 4–A of December 1947, the
                    launching of peacetime covert action operations. <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 4–A made the Director of Central Intelligence responsible for
                    psychological warfare, establishing at the same time the principle that covert
                    action was an exclusively Executive Branch function. The Central Intelligence
                    Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>) certainly was a natural choice but
                    it was assigned this function at least in part because the Agency controlled
                    unvouchered funds, by which operations could be funded with minimal risk of
                    exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="Notesfn1"><gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 4–A, December 17, 1947, is printed in <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d257"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi>

                <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s early use of its new covert action
                    mandate dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The
                    Department of State, believing this role too important to be left to the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> alone and concerned that the military might
                    create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen the
                    issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside.
                    Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                    directive, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, superseded <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 4–A.</p>
                <p><gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any
                    US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and
                    that if un<pb n="XXXVI" facs="0037" xml:id="pg_XXXVI"/>covered the US Government
                    can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.”</p>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:
                    “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage,
                    demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
                    assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee
                    liberations [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] groups, and support of indigenous
                    anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such
                    operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military forces,
                    espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military
                        operations.”<note n="2" xml:id="Notesfn2"><gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, June 18, 1948, is printed ibid., <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d292">Document 292</ref>.</note></p>
                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> on September 1, 1948, in accordance with
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, assumed responsibility for
                    organizing and managing covert actions. The OPC, which was to take its guidance
                    from the Department of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime,
                    initially had direct access to the State Department and to the military without
                    having to proceed through the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s
                    administrative hierarchy, provided the Director of Central Intelligence (<gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>) was informed of all important projects and
                        decisions.<note n="3" xml:id="Notesfn3">Memorandum of conversation by Frank
                        G. Wisner, “Implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>–10/2,”
                        August 12, 1948, is printed ibid., <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d298">Document 298</ref>.</note> In 1950 this arrangement was modified to
                    ensure that policy guidance came to the OPC through the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>.</p>
                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically
                    prominent of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s activities. Concerned
                    about this situation, <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> Walter Bedell Smith
                    in early 1951 asked the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> for enhanced policy
                    guidance and a ruling on the proper “scope and magnitude” of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> operations. The White House responded with two
                    initiatives. In April 1951 President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> created the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under the
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> to coordinate government-wide
                    psychological warfare strategy. <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/5,
                    issued in October 1951, reaffirmed the covert action mandate given in <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and expanded the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s authority over guerrilla warfare.<note n="4" xml:id="Notesfn4"><gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/5, “Scope and Pace

                    was soon abolished by the incoming Eisenhower administration, but the expansion
                    of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s covert action writ in <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 10/5 helped ensure that covert action would
                    remain a major function of the Agency.</p>
                <p>As the <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> administration ended, the
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was near the peak of its independence
                    and authority in the field of covert action. Although the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> continued to seek and receive advice on
                    specific proj<pb n="XXXVII" facs="0038" xml:id="pg_XXXVII"/>ects from the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, the PSB, and the departmental representatives
                    originally delegated to advise the OPC, no group or officer outside of the
                        <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> and the President himself had authority
                    to order, approve, manage, or curtail operations.</p>

                    5412/2 Special Group; 303 Committee</p>
                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s latitude in 1954. In accordance with a series of National
                    Security Council directives, the responsibility of the Director of Central
                    Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified.
                    President Eisenhower approved <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> 5412 on March
                    15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agency’s responsibility for
                    conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth;
                    the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> was made responsible for coordinating
                    with designated representatives of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
                    Defense to ensure that covert operations were planned and conducted in a manner
                    consistent with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign and military
                    policies; and the Operations Coordinating Board was designated the normal
                    channel for coordinating support for covert operations among State, Defense, and
                    the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. Representatives of the Secretary of
                    State, the Secretary of Defense, and the President were to be advised in advance
                    of major covert action programs initiated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> under this policy and were to give policy approval for such
                    programs and secure coordination of support among the Departments of State and

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> paramilitary capabilities at President
                    Kennedy’s request and submitted a report in June that recommended strengthening
                    high-level direction of covert operations. As a result of the Taylor Report, the
                    Special Group, chaired by the President’s Special Assistant for National
                    Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy, and including Deputy Under Secretary of State
                    U. Alexis Johnson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric, Director of
                    Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                    General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater responsibility for planning and
                    reviewing covert operations. Until 1963 the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>
                    determined whether a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>-originated project was
                    submitted to the Special Group. In 1963 the Special Group developed general but
                    informal criteria, including risk, possibility of success, potential for
                    exposure, political sensitivity, and cost (a threshold of $25,000 was adopted by
                    the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>), for determining whether covert action
                    projects were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8" xml:id="Notesfn8">Ibid., p. 82.</note></p>
                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership
                    was the same as the Special Group plus Attorney General Robert Kennedy and
                    General Taylor (as Chairman), exercised responsibility for Operation Mongoose, a
                    major covert action program aimed at overthrowing the Castro regime in Cuba.
                    When President Kennedy authorized the program in November, he designated
                    Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale, Assistant for Special Operations to the
                    Secretary of Defense, to act as chief of operations, and Lansdale coordinated
                    the Mongoose activities among the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the
                    Departments of State and Defense. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> units
                    in Washington and Miami had primary responsibility for implementing Mongoose
                    operations, which included military, sabotage, and political propaganda
                        programs.<note n="9" xml:id="Notesfn9">See <ref target="frus1961-63v10#d270"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1961–1963, volume X,

                <p>President Kennedy also established a Special Group (Counter-Insurgency) on
                    January 18, 1962, when he signed NSAM No. 124. The Special Group (CI), set up to

                    to establishing broad policies aimed at preventing and resisting subversive

                    early 1966, in NSAM No. 341, President Johnson <pb n="XXXIX" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_XXXIX"/>assigned responsibility for the direction and
                    coordination of counter-insurgency activities overseas to the Secretary of

                <p>The Special Group and the 303 Committee approved 163 covert actions during the

                    that of the several thousand projects undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> since 1961, only 14 percent were considered on a case-by-case
                    basis by the 303 Committee and its predecessors (and successors). Those not
                    reviewed by the 303 Committee were low-risk and low-cost operations. The Final
                    Report also cited a February 1967 <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>

                <p>The effectiveness of covert action has always been difficult for any
                    administration to gauge, given concerns about security and the difficulty of
                    judging the impact of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> initiatives on
                    events. In October 1969 the new Nixon administration required annual 303
                    Committee reviews for all covert actions that the Committee had approved and
                    automatic termination of any operation not reviewed after 12 months. On February
                    17, 1970, President Nixon signed National Security Decision Memorandum 40,<note n="13" xml:id="Notesfn13">For text of NSDM 40, see <ref target="frus1969-76v02#d203"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> ,

                    to the 40 Committee, in part because the 303 Committee had been named in the
                    media. The Attorney Gen<pb n="XL" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_XL"/>eral was also
                    added to the membership of the Committee. NSDM 40 reaffirmed the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss>’s responsibility for the coordination,
                    control, and conduct of covert operations and directed him to obtain policy
                    approval from the 40 Committee for all major and “politically sensitive” covert
                    operations. He was also made responsible for ensuring an annual review by the 40
                    Committee of all approved covert operations.</p>
                <p>The 40 Committee met regularly early in the Nixon administration, but over time
                    the number of formal meetings declined and business came to be conducted via
                    couriers and telephone votes. The Committee actually met only for major new
                    proposals. As required, the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> submitted
                    annual status reports to the 40 Committee for each approved operation. According
                    to the 1976 Church Committee Final Report, the 40 Committee considered only
                    about 25 percent of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s individual covert
                    action projects, concentrating on major projects that provided broad policy
                    guidelines for all covert actions. Congress received briefings on only a few
                    proposed projects. Not all major operations, moreover, were brought before the
                    40 Committee: President Nixon in 1970 instructed the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> to promote a coup d’ etat against Chilean President Salvador

                    ongoing covert action, and remained active through at least 1978. <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> officials in mid-1978 sought to downgrade or
                    abolish the SAWG and replace it as needed with ad hoc working groups. Internal
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> reviews at the end of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration state that the SAWG
                    gradually fell out of use. By late 1979, the means for debating, developing, and
                    guiding certain covert actions was an interagency working group chaired by
                        <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. This group was referred to by several names
                    during the late <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration,
                    including the Deputy’s (or Deputies) group, the <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> group, the interagency group, the Black Chamber, and the
                    Black Room.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration made use of a
                    new category of presidential findings for “world-wide” or “general” (or
                    “generic”) covert operations. This continued a practice initiated late in the
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration in response to
                    the Hughes-Ryan requirement for presidential findings. The worldwide category
                    covered lower-risk operations that were directed at broad policy goals
                    implemented on a worldwide basis as assets allowed. These operations utilized
                    existing assets as well as existing liaison contacts with foreign intelligence
                    or security services, and in some cases also consisted of routine training or
                    procurement undertaken to assist foreign intelligence partners or other agencies
                    of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.A new type of document —known as
                    “Perspectives”—provided more specific tasking guidance for these general,
                    worldwide covert activities. Perspectives detailed the themes to be stressed in
                    furtherance of a particular policy goal. Riskier operations required their own
                    presidential finding or Memorandum of Notification (see below). Perspectives
                    were drafted by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and cleared by the
                    Department of State, so that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could vet
                    the operational feasibility and risks of the program while State could assess
                    the diplomatic risks and verify that the program was consistent with overall
                    foreign policy goals. At least initially, Perspectives did not require further
                    coordination with the OAG, <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>, or the
                    President. Once an agreed-upon Perspectives document was finalized by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the Department of State, it was
                    transmitted to the field, and posts were required to make periodic reports on
                    any achievements under the Perspectives guidelines. Beginning in 1978, actions
                    in this worldwide category were authorized by the President as specific
                    line-item additions to a previously existing “world-wide” finding, though
                    Perspectives were still used to provide additional details.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration was the
                    “Memorandum of Notification” (MON). MONs were initially used to introduce
                    higher-risk, significantly higher-cost, or more geographically-specific
                    operations under a previously-approved worldwide or general objective

                        (January 30, 1978), pp. 194–214. Since E.O. 12036 governed foreign

                <p>In October 1980, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1981—also
                    known as the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980—scaled back the Hughes-Ryan
                    amendment’s provisions for congressional oversight of covert action. While the
                    requirement to notify Congress about presidential findings remained in place,
                    the new Act limited the committees of Congress that had to be briefed to the two
                    intelligence committees, and also explicitly clarified that this requirement to
                    keep the committees “fully and currently informed” did not constitute a
                    requirement for congressional approval of covert action or other intelligence
                    activities. Moreover, the new Act stipulated that if the President determined it
                    was “essential to limit prior notice to meet extraordinary circumstances
                    affecting vital interests of the United States,” the President could limit prior
                    notice to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the two intelligence
                    committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and the majority and
                    minority leaders of the Senate—a group that came to be known as the “Gang of
                    Eight.” If prior notice of a covert action was withheld, the President was
                    required to inform the two intelligence committees “in a timely fashion” and
                    provide a statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice.<note n="20" xml:id="Notesfn20">PL 96–450, Sec. 407 (October 14, 1980). See also the

                    Perspectives document. Like Perspectives, MONs had to be coordinated between the
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the Department of State, but they
                    also required broader interagency coordination within the SAWG or <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>. MONs subsequently came to be used for
                    significant changes to any type of finding, not just worldwide ones. Entirely
                    new covert actions continued to require new presidential findings. The
                    Hughes-Ryan amendment stipulated that Congress be notified of new findings “in a
                    timely fashion,” but did not specify how much time that meant. During the
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> typically notified Congress of new covert

                    MONs.</p>

                        Afghanistan, he stressed his nationalist, non-aligned position. He said he
                        would visit Moscow for 2–3 days the end of March or early April. End

                        Foreign Ministry Director General Ghaus. I began the conversation by once
                        again congratulating him on his recent election and on the new Afghan
                            Constitution.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3"><persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> declared himself President following the

                    <p>3. I then gave him a précis of the principal foreign policy positions and
                        initiatives of our new administration and followed by going through the
                        talking points in para 3(B) of <gloss target="#t_Ref_1">ref</gloss> B.
                        Regarding narcotics, I added that we would like to have a statement
                        delineating precisely <pb n="2" facs="0047" xml:id="pg_2"/>what the Afghan
                            <gloss target="#t_Govt_1">Govt</gloss> will do this year to control the

                    <p>4. In a lengthy response, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> began
                        by praising the efforts being made by the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration to promote peaceful solutions of
                        problems like the Middle East and Southern Africa and to reach new
                        agreements on arms control. He said that peace is essential for Afghanistan
                        in order for it to progress. But he quickly added that “honor” is even more
                        important than peace and that Afghanistan would fight if necessary for its
                        independence and would never accept dictation from anyone. To illustrate the
                        latter point, he told me in confidence that the Soviets had at one time
                        tried to dissuade him from sending Afghan military officers for training to
                        India but that he had told the Soviets that this was none of their
                        business.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> said that he is most pleased
                        with Afghan-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations, adding that
                        during the past three and one-half years, we have reached a highly
                        satisfactory higher level of mutual understanding. He said that
                        Afghan-Soviet relations are good and that he plans to visit Moscow in
                        response to a Soviet invitation for 2–3 days at the end of March or early
                            April.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">See <ref target="#d2">Document

                        He said that Afghan-Chinese relations are good and getting better.</p>
                    <p>6. Regarding narcotics, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> said
                        that in his opinion it would be a relatively minor matter for the
                        international community to assist in a development program in Badakhshan.
                        Regarding <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan cooperation in the
                        narcotics field, he said that after his new Cabinet has taken office,
                        intensive studies would be made to determine in what areas the Afghan <gloss target="#t_Govt_1">Govt</gloss> would like American assistance.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> made no comment regarding
                        our economic assistance program, but I did give him a paper summarizing the
                        status of present and potential projects (copy pouched to <gloss target="#t_NEA_1">NEA</gloss>). He also did not comment when I informed

                    <p>2544. Subject: <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s Afghanistan
                        and His Trip to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>1. Summary: <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> is not “in
                        political trouble,” but the country he left April 12 for his three day visit
                        to the Soviet Union is not quite the settled entity he ruled before the
                        “Loya Jirgah” (Constitutional Assembly), the passage of a new Constitution
                        earlier this year and the appointment of a new Cabinet. As for the visit
                        itself we credit Afghan protestations that it is “routine”—though the
                        intensity of Afghan-Soviet relations and recent political events in this
                        part of the world will offer plenty to talk about. As seems to have become a
                        regular event in Afghan-Russian relations, a Chinese delegation turned up in
                        Kabul just in time to offer counterpoint to the larger theme. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> left for Moscow
                        April 12, along with his Minister of Commerce (Jalalar), Minister for
                        Planning (Khurrani), Minister of Water and Power (Mohammadi), Minister in
                        Charge for Foreign Affairs (<persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Waheed
                            Abdullah</persName>), and a lower ranking staff that included Samad
                        Ghaus (the Foreign Ministry’s Deputy for Political Affairs—de facto Deputy
                        Minister).</p>
                    <p>3. The scene at home. The domestic political scene <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> left behind was less tranquil, less
                        settled than <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> has experienced
                        for some time. Discontent about the Cabinet announced March 17 (see Kabul
                        1921) has broken out in the Afghan “establishment”—and in less prestigious
                        strata, we believe, as well. One influential Mohammadzai <pb n="4" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_4"/>cousin, Sultan Mahmoud Ghazi, has not
                        bothered to mute his disaffection, nurtured by his discontent with Daoud’s
                        closest associates. (See Kabul 2530)<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">In telegram
                            1921 from Kabul, March 20, the Embassy reported on the largely unchanged
                            character of Afghanistan’s new Cabinet. In telegram 2530, also from
                            Kabul, April 13, the Embassy characterized Sultan Ghazi’s displeasure
                            with some of President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                            associates as an apparent “open struggle within the government
                            bureaucracy.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                            respectively)</note></p>
                    <p>4. Further, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> was unable or
                        unwilling to appoint someone to fill the constitutionally required role of
                        Vice President, since the National Revolution Party from which this official
                        (or “these officials,” for <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> may
                        appoint several Vice Presidents) is constitutionally to be drawn has not
                        itself taken shape and been “proclaimed.” (De facto Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Waheed Abdullah</persName> told the
                        Ambassador that during <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                        absence the nation’s affairs would be in the hands of a “collegium”—members
                        unspecified.) In a press conference (septel) given on the eve of the
                        departure <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> in fact admitted
                        that party formation had gone sour—that, momentarily, the party had been
                        captured by “a number of opportunists—” a number of “saboteurs” working “on
                        their own will.”<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">In telegram 2555 from Kabul,
                            April 14, the Embassy summarized <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s remarks at the April 10 press conference.
                            (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central
                            Foreign Policy File, D770129–0726)</note> From some quarters came hints
                        also of a breaking scandal possibly involving mistreatment—unbeknownest to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>, it is said—of political
                        prisoners. (The facts of this are murky and are not yet to be believed—and
                        certainly are not to be mentioned to Afghans. We mention the matter here as
                        allegations likely to affect the regime, true or not.)</p>
                    <p>5. Perhaps all this is but an inevitable moment of discontent following the
                        high hopes engendered by the Loya Jirgah (Kabul 1188), the new Constitution
                        (Kabul 1379) and the March 21 new Afghan calendar year.<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">In telegram 1188 from Kabul, February 16, the Embassy
                            assessed whether the Loya Jirgah, which ended February 15, was a
                            legitimate effort at constitutional reform or a “cynical” attempt to
                            “legitimize one man rule under constitutional guise.” In telegram 1379
                            from Kabul, February 27, the Embassy emphasized that even with the new
                            Constitution, “power ultimately resides with the President.” (National

                        negative signals may prove later to have had deeper significance.</p>
                    <p>6. The external scene. Aside from unpleasantness with Iran (Kabul 2495),
                        Afghanistan’s external relations are good—including with the Soviet
                            Union.<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">In telegram 2495 from Kabul, April 12,
                            the Embassy noted that the downturn in Afghan-Iranian relations was
                            disappointing in light of gains made between 1973 and 1975, but that the
                            United States was essentially powerless to change the situation. The
                            dispute stemmed largely over water rights to the Helmand River.

                            Foreign Policy File, D770126–1058)</note> A Russian bouquet to <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> appeared just prior to the <pb n="5" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_5"/>visit in the Soviet Embassy’s “news bulletin”
                        of April 9, assuring Afghans that “our ideals . . . differ from yours but we
                        interfere neither in your domestic affairs, nor do we intervene in the
                        independent actions of your people. We support any phenomenon that plays a
                        progressive role in the development of your people.”</p>
                    <p>7. Officials here in “characterizing” the <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> visit to Moscow have kept the “correct” (cards held
                        close to the vest) stance they usually take with us when Afghan-Soviet
                        relations are concerned. They have, in fact, told nothing to us (or to
                        anyone, we believe) about the visit. In his April 10 press conference
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> presented the trip
                        as no more than a follow-on to President Podgorny’s visit to Kabul in
                        December of 1975, just another “leaders of two countries . . . strengthening
                        and consolidating ties” kind of thing. This may be disingenuous, but it may
                        also be the final truth. The mere volume of Afghan-Russian transactions in
                        aid and trade would seem to fill any “working agenda,” an expectation
                        confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s having taken
                        three Cabinet Ministers from the trade/economics/development field. Enough
                        has happened in South Asia recently—things like the Indian elections and the
                        political siege against <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName>—to
                        give plenty of food for conversation during time that remains.</p>
                    <p>8. With a regularity that rules out mere coincidence a “Chinese connection”
                        appeared on the eve of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                        departure, this time in the form of Mr. Chai Shu Fan, Vice Minister for
                        Foreign Trade, who arrived in Kabul April 9. These Chinese diversions have
                        become a regular event when Afghan-Soviet relations could become a news
                        media preoccupation. We are not certain how these diversionary events get
                        planned, though their taking place clearly coincides with both Afghan and
                        Chinese intentions.</p>

                    <p>1. I called on President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> the
                        morning of August 17. The conversation was in every respect cordial. It
                        lasted one hour. President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        appeared to have fully recovered from some of the minor health problems he
                        had suffered earlier this summer, such as dental surgery.</p>
                    <p>2. I referred to our pleasure in having Ambassador Karim in Washington and
                        how much we looked forward to welcoming Foreign Minister Abdullah to New
                        York and California in the coming weeks.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">Abdullah

                            October 1, he met with <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> in
                            New York to discuss a range of bilateral issues; the meeting resulted in
                            mutual affirmations of improved <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> also extended President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s invitation to <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> to visit the United States.

                        <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> asked me to convey his thanks
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> for the warm
                        reception accorded Ambassador Karim. He also asked me to transmit his
                        personal best wishes to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. Following discussion of economic and narcotics matters which are the
                        subjects of septels, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> said he
                        is greatly concerned about the large quantity of Communist propaganda
                        publications which are being brought into Afghanistan through the mails and
                        illegally from Western Europe and the United States. He related this
                        propaganda barrage to his concern about the inroads he sees the Communists
                        making in countries like Thailand and Ethiopia. He said he still subscribes
                        to the domino theory. He said Afghanistan is particularly sensitive to
                        developments of this kind in the world because of its long border with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>4. Regarding Communist propaganda, I told <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> if there were any specific examples he would like me
                        to investigate, I would try to do so. He agreed with me that most of it is
                        so boring that it doesn’t have much effect, but said that nevertheless,
                        people read it.</p>
                    <p>5. I also mentioned that I do not believe everything in the world is coming
                        up roses for the Soviet Union. In this connection, I mentioned the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> meeting and pledges of Japanese
                        and Australian <pb n="7" facs="0052" xml:id="pg_7"/>support to the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">The <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> Summit was held August 4–5

                        hopefully, bring about conditions in those areas which will limit
                        opportunities for the Soviets. At the conclusion of my remarks, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> commented that the Soviets no doubt
                        are having problems.</p>

                    <p>1. Our existing intelligence capability in Afghanistan is miniscule as
                        compared to the like-sized producing region in the “Golden Triangle”.<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">A reference to the area of Asia, comprising parts
                            of Burma, Laos, and Thailand, that produces opium.</note> The Central
                        Intelligence Agency’s mission in Afghanistan has been essentially limited to
                        activities regarding the Soviet Union. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2. The Afghan Minister-in-Charge of Foreign Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Waheed Abdullah</persName>, will be attending the
                        upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York. We have suggested that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> meet with him to express
                        our deep concern over Afghanistan’s increased opium production. This is the
                        next logical step in a series of demarches to Afghanistan, which have
                        included U.N., as well as <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p>3. Our Ambassador to Kabul has suggested that President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> would like to visit you, and
                        recommended that such a visit could have impact on our narcotics effort. In
                        Afghanistan, nothing happens <pb n="8" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_8"/>without
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s approval and direction.
                        We cannot expect further progress in the narcotics field without his
                        personal interest, and continuing surveillance. While Afghanistan is not a
                        priority country in the context of global affairs, in addition to being one
                        of the world’s poorest countries it is the single most significant threat to
                        our long term narcotics efforts, and meeting <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> could in fact move him to take a more active role in
                        containment of the illicit narcotics of the region. We would therefore
                        suggest acceptance of a <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> visit
                        early next year. The timing of such a visit is important and would be most
                        beneficial during the early Spring, since late Spring is harvesting season
                        and <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> could, in fact, cause the
                        interdiction and destruction of large amounts of opium on his return to
                        Kabul. Such a meeting would also be a logical follow-up of the <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>-Abdullah meeting this Fall.</p>
                    <p>4. By far the most important decision to be made in support of our efforts is
                        on selection of our next Ambassador to Kabul. In order for us to be able to
                        follow through on our devised strategy and escalate anti-narcotics efforts
                        at the earliest possible moment, it is important that in addition to a
                        firsthand knowledge of Afghanistan and its political constraints, our next
                        Ambassador should be competent in the narcotics field and have an existing
                        relationship with the leaders of Afghanistan at the Ministerial level.</p>
                    <p>An individual with these qualifications is available. He is not, however, a
                        career Foreign Service Officer, and consequently a determination must be
                        made that the appointment to Afghanistan should be considered by the
                        Ambassadorial Review Commission, which it has not been up to this point. The
                        Commission has the name of the individual before it, as well as
                        Congressional recommendations and would in all likelihood include that name
                        in any list submitted to you. I would therefore suggest that Afghanistan be
                        considered a country to which a non-career assignment would be appropriate.
                        With your approval, such a suggestion will be made to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “OK” and initialed “J”

                            been in that position since November 1973 and did not leave the post

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>Soviet economic assistance and trade have become dominant external forces in
                        Afghan development, and military assistance is virtually the exclusive
                        province of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In the 23 years
                        since Moscow’s first commitment to Kabul—also its first to an <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>—the Soviet presence has become pervasive
                        and the Soviet role in Afghan development critical. Despite Kabul’s efforts
                        to maintain a non-aligned position by balancing Western and Communist
                        interests, we see no major change in Afghanistan’s reliance on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for military or economic aid in the
                        short term. This is particularly true for the military supply relationship,
                        since Kabul would be hard put to find alternate sources for modern weapons
                        on terms as favorable as Moscow’s.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have given Kabul aid on unusually easy terms to ensure a special
                        Soviet-Afghan relationship which Moscow believes is important to its
                        security interests. This assistance has always been far more concessional
                        and has included more grant aid than Moscow’s aid to its other clients.
                        Moscow also has agreed to frequent rescheduling of Kabul’s debt and has
                        covered most of Afghanistan’s local project costs, a concession rarely
                        allowed other aid recipients. Soviet military contracts generally have
                        allowed a 75 percent discount from list prices and are payable over 15 to 25
                        years at two percent interest. Large economic credits have allowed up to 25
                        years for amortization, after as much as 25 years grace, with interest at
                        2–2.5 percent. These compare with the usual Soviet terms of 10 years
                        repayment at 2 percent for military contracts and 12 years at 2.5 percent
                        for economic aid.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Aid</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan’s 1956 border dispute with Pakistan led to the signing of a $100
                        million arms agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the
                        first of a series of accords that have made Moscow responsible for all

                            Afghan-Pakistani dispute over the Durand Line, named after the British
                            diplomat Sir Henry Mortimer Durand, who negotiated with the Amir of
                            Afghanistan a border demarcating the territories of British India and
                            Afghanistan in 1893. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the
                            Durand Line became a contested boundary dividing the Pushtun tribal
                            lands of Afghanistan and Pakistan. See <ref target="frus1955-57v08#d103"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1955–1957, vol. VIII,

                        more than $600 million of military equipment since 1956 have supplied over
                        95 percent of Afghanistan’s total military receipts. Deliveries have
                        included MIG and Sukhoi fighter aircraft, medium tanks, surface-to-air
                        missiles, helicopters, and armored vehicles. Even though the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has not signed a major new arms accord
                        with Afghanistan since 1975, deliveries are continuing under the $50 million
                        of orders still outstanding. Thus far in 1977 Afghanistan has received AN–26
                        transports, SA–3 and <gloss target="#t_SA7_1">SA–7</gloss> missiles as well
                        as field artillery, radar and ground equipment.</p>
                    <p>Moscow also has borne almost sole responsibility for support and maintenance
                        of Afghan weapons systems. Despite more than 20 years of Soviet technical
                        assistance, Kabul still is dependent on Soviet advisors and training. The
                        number of Soviet technical personnel in Afghanistan has varied with the flow
                        of arms. In 1967 their number peaked at 525, and in 1977 about 350 Soviet
                        military personnel were present. By the end of 1977 the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will have trained 3,700 Afghan military
                        personnel in the Soviet Union, of which about 650 will still be in training.
                        We expect the number of Soviet technicians and trainees in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to increase next year to service and
                        instruct Afghan’s military on the new, more technically advanced equipment
                        now being delivered.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Aid</p>
                    <p>Despite US assistance of almost half a billion dollars and Afghanistan’s
                        recent success in attracting almost $900 million of <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> pledges (only $65 million of which has
                        been disbursed) the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> continues as
                        Afghanistan’s single most important source of economic aid and its principal
                        trading partner. A $425 million credit, extended in 1975 for Kabul’s current
                        Seven Year Plan (21 March 1976–20 March 1983) accounts for one-third of
                        Moscow’s total $1.3 billion commitment to Kabul and is the largest single
                        Soviet commitment to Afghanistan to date. If the ambitious Fifth Plan is
                        actually carried out, Kabul probably will turn to Moscow for additional aid.
                        In the meantime, Soviet deliveries will continue under $600 million of
                        credits still outstanding.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet program—on which Moscow has already delivered $700 million of
                        aid—has provided about one-half of the foreign exchange component for
                        projects under Afghanistan’s four five-year plans. With this assistance,
                        two-thirds of Afghanistan’s roads and one-half of its <pb n="11" facs="0056" xml:id="pg_11"/>electric power capacity was built. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> constructed major airfields, developed
                        an extensive power transmission network, and put some 100,000 acres of land
                        into cultivation. Moscow also built several small industrial plants and
                        developed Afghanistan’s natural gas industry, which now provides the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> almost 3 billion cubic meters of gas a
                        year through a Soviet built pipeline.</p>
                    <p>We see no diminution in the Soviet economic presence over the near term. The
                        1,000 Soviet technicians are presently employed in mineral, oil and gas
                        exploration, fertilizer production, and power, irrigation, and
                        transportation projects. Additional technical personnel probably will be
                        requested as work progresses on two power projects and a $600 million
                        copper-smelting complex, now on the drawing boards.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I have been following with great interest reports of your recent trip to
                        Yugoslavia, Libya, India and Pakistan and was particularly impressed and
                        heartened by your statements in Islamabad and Lahore about relations between
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">An overview of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s trip to Europe, the Middle

                            telegram 1281 from Kabul, February 14. <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s remarks in Islamabad emphasizing the importance
                            of good relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan were reported in

                        growth in South Asia are important concerns of my administration.</p>
                    <p>I know both our countries share a desire to strengthen the very cordial ties
                        which already exist. Afghan-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations
                        are very important to me personally, and we highly value your friendship. It
                        was for this reason that I asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> to discuss with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WA_1">Waheed Abdullah</persName> the possibility of your
                        visiting the United States this coming summer.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">See

                        personal regret, that I must ask your understanding in postponing your
                        visit. I am sure you realize that I make this request with the greatest
                        reluctance. Much of the critical legislation which I had hoped would be
                        enacted before the end of 1977 remains before Congress. These concern issues
                        of vital importance, such as energy and economic growth, which require my
                        personal attention. In addition, major foreign policy questions, such as
                        peace in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, and arms control
                        negotiations, remain unresolved. Finally, the United States will be having
                        Congressional elections this Fall that will make heavy demands on my
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I sincerely hope that this delay will not cause you inconvenience. I do very
                        much look forward to meeting with you and hope that we will be able to

                    <p>2715. Subject: After <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>: Is a
                        Peaceful Succession in the Cards?</p>
                    <p>1. This cable constitutes the summary chapter of an Embassy study of the
                        succession question in Afghanistan. The final study is being transmitted by
                            airgram.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Not found.</note></p>
                    <p>2. Introduction: Afghanistan’s President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Mohammad Daoud</persName> appears to enjoy good health, and he has five
                        more years remaining of his constitutionally mandated term of office.
                        Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s age (69), the
                        quickening implementation of his political program for this country, and
                        Afghanistan’s long tradition of coups and assassinations, suggest that
                        political change could occur with little warning. Thus, the succession issue
                        is a germane one.</p>
                    <p><pb n="13" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_13"/>3. The relative dearth of prominent
                        political figures who could readily step into any vacated Presidential shoes
                        indicates that Afghanistan may experience a succession struggle whose
                        outcome will ultimately be decided by the interplay of various interest
                        groups rather than by any single individual able to dominate events.
                        Prominent among such groups—and their currently leading contenders for
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s mantle—are: the
                        “centrist” military, represented by National Defense Minister Ghulam Haider
                        Rassuli; the Mohammadzai clan “establishment,” represented principally
                        (within Afghanistan) by <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                        brother Mohammad Naim; and, the conservative military, possibly represented
                        by the exiled Mohammadzai ex-General Abdul Wali, who might also forge a
                        candidacy based on some centrist support.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">The
                            Mohammadzai tribe had dominated Afghan politics since 1826.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s own apparent choice, Vice
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Syed Abdulilah</persName>, appears to
                        possess little independent political support, but his chances should improve
                        the longer he is in the number two position.</p>
                    <p>4. Neither the organized Left nor the reactionary, religious, and landowning
                        Right appears to have identifiable candidates at this time, and neither
                        element will probably furnish <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s successor. However, the organized Left, due to its
                        relatively greater efficiency and experience, could conceivably play a
                        significant role in the succession contest, with or without Soviet backing.
                        The reactionary Right constitutes the country’s single interest group, and,
                        even though the Right probably will not unite behind any specific contender,
                        this group’s role will be crucial nonetheless, because, in all likelihood,
                        no candidate can attain or maintain leadership in the face of rightist
                            opposition.<note n="4" xml:id="d7fn4">An intelligence memorandum
                            produced in the Central Intelligence Agency, March 3, also assessed the
                            factors influencing <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                            eventual succession. The memorandum predicted: “the ability of foreign
                            powers to influence the result” of the succession “will be limited,
                            however, barring a massive and highly unlikely Soviet effort. At most,
                            foreign support might give one candidate or another a slight edge, but
                            given the Afghans’ deep suspicions of foreign intentions, indications of
                            foreign backing would do an individual more harm than good.” (Central
                            Intelligence Agency, Directorate of Intelligence, Office of Support
                            Services, Job 80T00634A: Production Case Files (1978), Box 2, Document
                            8)</note></p>
                    <p>5. The immediate post-<persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> period.
                        Were <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> to die in office, we
                        would anticipate a brief caretaker government under the leadership of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s brother Mohammad Naim,
                        whose prestige and Mohammadzai credentials make him acceptable to almost all
                        competing groups, but whose age (approximately 68) excludes him as a likely
                        long-term successor. A Naim government might be forged in partnership with
                        General Rassuli, the present dominant military leader and a Mohammadzai,
                        whose ambitions are unclear but probably include the Presidency. Aside from
                        the patrician Naim, no other individual appears to represent the interests
                        of the in-country Mohammadzai clan. <pb n="14" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_14"/>Nonetheless, given the prestige and educational/career advantages the
                        Mohammadzais enjoy, we anticipate that the eventual successor will have some
                        familial links to the clan.</p>
                    <p>6. The increasingly prominent political figure is 33-year old Vice-President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdulilah</persName>, himself a Mohammadzai,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s de facto adopted son,
                        and seemingly the person chosen by the President as his successor. <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdulilah</persName>’s chances should improve
                        significantly the longer <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        remains in office and grooms him as his protege and successor. <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdulilah</persName> also needs a few more years under
                        his belt to become more acceptable as a leader in this society where age is
                        respected.</p>
                    <p>7. Forces of the Right. The reactionary Right poses the greatest immediate
                        and potential threat to <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                        regime, as it has to Afghanistan’s previous “reformist” governments. Even
                        though the reactionary religious and landowning elements will probably not
                        supply <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s successor, these
                        factions will affect the outcome of the succession struggle by creating
                        significant obstacles to the accession of a candidate deemed ideologically
                        or politically unacceptable to the mass of the Afghan populace (which is
                        very conservative).</p>
                    <p>8. At the moment, we discern little support, even among rightist elements,
                        for a restoration of the pre-coup monarchy, headed by exiled King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d7fn5">On the
                            ouster of King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir Shah</persName> in
                            July 1973, see <ref target="frus1969-76ve08#d4"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1969–1976, vol. E–8, Documents on South
                                Asia, 1973–1976, Document 4</ref>.</note> However, it is
                        conceivable, though not likely, that ambitious, tough, exiled ex-General
                        Abdul Wali (a first cousin of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>)
                        could attain power as a compromise candidate with Mohammadzai credentials,
                        or on the shoulders of a semi-royalist military movement. In either case, it
                        would likely be as a “last resort” candidate, called upon by the center or
                        Mohammadzai clansmen, to preclude political chaos or leftist threat.</p>
                    <p>9. The leftist challenge. The extent to which <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> temporarily leaned on left-wing forces within and
                        without the military to return to power in 1973 is an important element of
                        any analysis of the post-<persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        period. Although <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> has virtually
                        eliminated this faction from meaningful positions of influence, these
                        left-wing forces have been very active within and outside the Daoudist
                        “movement” and could still play some post-<persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> role. A few members of this group were, for example,
                        recently appointed to the High Council of the Armed Forces, which could
                        indicate they may still possess an element of power. The recently
                        reorganized pro-Soviet “Khalq” (“Masses”) Party is probably the best
                        organized and most experienced political force in the country even though
                        still very small in numbers.</p>
                    <p><pb n="15" facs="0060" xml:id="pg_15"/>10. Nevertheless, we cannot identify
                        any significant leftist candidates who might replace <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>, either in the near or long-term.
                        While large numbers of Afghan military officers have been exposed to Soviet
                        training in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or have had contact
                        with Soviet military advisors in Afghanistan, it is unknown how many may
                        have become Marxist or pro-Soviet. Given the government’s anti-Communist
                        leanings, they are not likely to express left-wing views at the present
                        time. However, one or more of these offices could emerge from obscurity with
                        remarkable rapidity in an unstable political environment, and we, therefore,
                        believe that any post-<persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        succession, which is not quickly resolved in favor of “centrist”—military or
                        civilian—leadership, could lead to a situation wherein the forces of the
                        Left could play a strong role.</p>
                    <p>11. Impact on United States interests. A prolonged or violent contest for
                        power [would] adversely affect our interest in regional stability by
                        threatening the independence and cohesion of Afghanistan. Conversely, a
                        quick succession by a moderately centrist leader, such as Naim, or
                        Rassuli—the most probable eventuality at this time, would likely pose no
                        problems for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests. (The Soviets
                        could possibly also live with such a solution.)</p>
                    <p>12. Conclusions: Given the traditional and conservative make-up of Muslim
                        Afghanistan, as well as the facts of Afghan political life since the 1973
                        coup and [garble—the elimination?] of the monarchy, the ultimate successor
                        to <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> will probably emerge from
                        the politically “centrist” groups, such as the military, or the civilian
                        “establishment” (i.e., the Mohammadzai clan). The inherent power of the
                        military—many of whose leaders are also Mohammadzais—not surprisingly gives
                        the military the inside track, although other pressure groups could
                        conceivably field solid contenders, provided they could elicit some military
                        support. Were General Rassuli to make an immediate move to seize power,
                        following <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>, we question that he
                        has the qualities that would enable him to remain in power. A long-term
                        leader will, in our view, emerge only after a period of pulling and hauling
                        among the many interest groups here.</p>
                    <p>13. The potential levels of violence which might explode following <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s departure could well be determined
                        by actions and choices which <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        himself takes during the unknown time left to him. An orderly succession
                        will thus depend on <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s ability
                        to convince competing groups that the direction in which he has set for
                        Afghan development takes into account the interests of all segments of
                        society, and that violent internecine conflict should be avoided at all
                        costs.</p>

                    <p>Our initial assessment is that the coup leaders were principally motivated by
                        a desire to seize power from the Mohammedzai clan/family, which has
                        dominated Afghanistan for 150 years.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">The Embassy
                            first reported the coup in telegram 3239 from Kabul, April 27 (1725Z),
                            which relayed the announcement from Radio Afghanistan that “<persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> is gone completely and forever.”
                            In telegram 3242 from Kabul, sent one hour and 45 minutes later, the
                            Embassy reported that “the coup appeared to have been triggered by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s arrest of the Khalq
                            leadership.” The Embassy was unsure at that juncture whether or not
                                <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> had been killed during
                            the fighting. The telegram included the text of a statement by the
                            Revolutionary Military Force of Afganistan: “The foreign policy is in
                            accordance with the respect and reservation of the Islamic religion,
                            democratic and individual independence, and the progressive development
                            of the country.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss>
                            59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780180–0719 and D780180–0882,
                            respectively)</note> The leaders, mostly military officers, appear to be
                        young, leftist and nationalistic. Some elements of the Afghan Communist
                        party are associated with coup leaders, and one party member has reportedly
                        been named Minister of Finance. There are no indications, however, of Soviet
                        complicity in the coup. The coup seems to have been hurriedly planned and
                        the Soviets may have been informed about it at the last moment. The Soviets
                        have traditionally acted with restraint toward Afghanistan. Although they
                        had probably become somewhat disillusioned with President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>, we do not think they would have
                        tried to take over this important non-aligned country. Although the Soviets
                        are probably not displeased with events, they may be cautious about exerting
                        overt and conspicuous influence in order not to unduly alarm Afghanistan’s
                        neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the facts, we will have to deal with the probable perceptions of the
                        Iranians and Pakistanis, as well as the US press and public, that the new
                        regime is little more than a Soviet proxy. Pakistan will be alarmed and its
                        acute sense of insecurity further enhanced if they believe themselves to be
                        virtually surrounded by Soviet-leaning regimes—India and Afghanistan. The
                        Shah will see this as confirmation of his “worst-case scenario”—the
                        encirclement of Iran by the Communists. The US press and public may portray
                        the situation as a new “Horn of Africa”. It is worth noting that the Kabul
                        events will attract <pb n="17" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_17"/>more than
                        ordinary attention in the third world, since a ministerial-level meeting of
                        the Non-Aligned Movement had been scheduled to meet in Kabul May 6–10.<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">The meeting was rescheduled for May 15–20 in
                            Havana.</note></p>
                    <p>One immediate task is to share our information and our assessments with the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Paks</gloss> and Iranians and try to dissuade
                        any hasty moves on their part. Our Embassies’ initial assessments are that
                        neither will move under present conditions. Such moves might set off a
                        chain-reaction in the area. We will also be closely watching the
                        Afghan/Soviet border for signs of any Soviet troop movements.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan had been making slow but steady economic progress. Iran and other
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries had promised the Daoud
                        Government substantial economic assistance and they now may have second
                        thoughts. Our <gloss target="#t_USAID_1">USAID</gloss> program runs about
                        $20 million a year and is concentrated on agricultural, public health and
                        educational programs in rural areas. In addition, we have about 95 Peace
                        Corps volunteers in Afghanistan almost all of whom work in Kabul. The only
                        significant <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commercial interest is that
                        Pan American has a 49% share of the Afghan national airline.</p>
                    <p>In the next few days we will have to make decisions on the following
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Diplomatic Recognition</hi>—We usually recognize new
                        regimes if they control the machinery of government and the countryside and
                        if they agree to honor international commitments made by the previous
                        regime. It is still too early to know whether or not the new government is
                        in full control. If there are public perceptions that the new regime is
                        Communist, there may be political pressures to withhold recognition. The
                        Soviets may extend recognition very soon.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Safety of Americans</hi>—There are about 1,000 Americans
                        in Kabul. There are no reported American casualties and the foreign
                        community in Kabul has not been threatened. If heavy fighting resumes, we
                        will have to consider whether or not to try an evacuation.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Soviet Angle</hi>—There have already been
                        speculative press reports describing this as a “communist coup”. As
                        mentioned above, we have no evidence of Soviet involvement, although the new
                        leadership may include leftists. However, the public and Congress may
                        perceive this as another Soviet victory and there may be pressures to do
                        something about it.</p>

                    <p>3300. Subject: <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s Last
                        Hours.</p>
                    <p>1. According to what appears to be a reliable eyewitness (one of the only two
                        survivors of the horror scene described), President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>, his brother Mohammad Naim, and
                        approximately 29 other persons, including <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s three sons, their wives and some of his
                        grandchildren, were executed in their house within the palace grounds on the
                        morning of April 28. (We presume that the wives of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and Naim were also in the group.)
                        According to this report <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> was
                        repeatedly urged to swear loyalty to the National Military Revolutionary
                        Council (<gloss target="#t_NMRC_1">NMRC</gloss>), but he refused.</p>
                    <p>2. To exert maximum pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        the coup forces made him and Naim witness the execution of their families by
                        submachine guns at about 0400 or 0430 on the morning of Friday, April 28
                        (the report did not contain information on exactly when <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and his family had actually fallen
                        into the insurgents’ hands). At 0800, a military officer arrived and made a
                        last offer to <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and Naim, but
                        the former President still refused. He and his brother were then summarily
                        executed by submachine gun fire.</p>
                    <p>3. According to a separate report from a Canadian doctor, <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s wife, Bilqis (who was also the
                        sister of exiled King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir Shah</persName>)
                        was brought into Jamhuriat Hospital during the night of April 27. She had
                        massive chest and abdominal gunshot wounds, and passed away shortly after
                        admission. Two of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                        grandchildren are still being treated in the orthopedic ward for gunshot
                        wounds.</p>
                    <p>4. The first report contains an additional enigmatic detail: during the final
                        confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> at 0800, a
                        “diplomatic car,” a phrase which most Afghans would interpret as “belonging
                        to a foreign Embassy”, was standing outside the <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> residence. We have received several reports—all
                        unverified as yet—of Soviet personnel being sighted with coup officers.</p>
                    <p><pb n="19" facs="0064" xml:id="pg_19"/>5. Comment: This version of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s death tracks with the new regime’s
                        subsequent formal announcement that the former leader had to be killed
                        because he would not submit to the authority of the <gloss target="#t_NMRC_1">NMRC</gloss>. The bloody details, however, will
                        probably never be officially acknowledged. If this story is true—and we have
                        no reason to doubt it considering the nature of this violent society—we are
                        provided with a vivid illustration of how venomous was the hatred of the
                        coup leaders against the “Nadir Shah” Yahya Khel clan of Mohammadzai family.
                        Also, this is the stubborn way we would have expected <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> to resist to the end.</p>

                    <p>1. On April 30, Radio Afghanistan announced at 1700 local time that
                        pro-Soviet Communist Khalq Party leader <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Nur
                            Mohammad Taraki</persName> has been named President of the Council of
                        the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) and Prime Minister (the same information was conveyed
                        officially to the Embassy at 1825 in a circular notice, delivered by a
                        member of the Foreign Ministry’s Protocol Department). As the top Afghan
                        Communist becomes head of state and chief of government, the true political
                        character of the coup leadership is now nakedly apparent to all.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, who was born on July 15,
                        1917, in Maimana Province in Northwestern Afghanistan, is a Pushtun. He has
                        been a prominent Communist leader since 1965. Among the significant
                        positions he has held are: Director-General of Publications in the Ministry
                        of Press and Information (1950–51); editor-in-chief of the official Bakhtar
                        news <pb n="20" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_20"/>agency (1951–52); Press Attaché
                        at the Afghan Embassy in Washington (1952–53); translator/interpreter for
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> USOM/A Mission at Kabul (ca. 1958);
                        translator for the American Embassy at Kabul (1962–63); became
                        General-Secretary of the Communist Party of Afghanistan (ca. May 1965);
                        editor of “Khalq” (“Masses”), the far-leftist newspaper (April–May 1966);
                        General Secretary of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        group of the Communist Party of Afghanistan (April 1967); chairman of the
                        Central Committee of the Unified Khalq-Parchamist Party (June 1977).</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was married in 1942, but
                        has no children. He has been described as “a shaven-headed, bulky man of
                        almost commanding ugliness.” He visited the Soviet Union for medical
                        treatment in 1965 or 1966, travelling extensively in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> during his 42-day sojourn. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> speaks Dari and English, in
                        addition to his native Pushtun. Fuller biographic details will be reported
                            later.<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">Not found and not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                    <p>4. Upon announcing the appointment of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, the Radio Voice of the new <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> has proclaimed that tomorrow, May Day, will be a national
                        holiday. Embassy officers have noted the appearance of some red flags
                        throughout Kabul this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>5. Comment: Many Afghan and foreign observers at Kabul were surprised that
                        the Communists have taken over complete power openly, discarding so early in
                        the game their initial veil of “Islamic nationalism”. This could represent a
                        serious miscalculation on their part however. The devout traditionalist
                        majority of this society hardly seems ready to accept the leadership of what
                        is, relatively speaking, a minuscule Communist elite. This reaction could
                        also include those elements of the rebelling armed forces who thought they
                        were fighting for broader nationalist and progressive goals. Additionally,
                        the regional security implications will undoubtedly be clear to the Iranian
                        and Pakistani Governments. With reference to the latter, we note that the
                        long collaboration between Afghan Communist leaders and Pushtunistan
                        nationalists appears to be continuing into the coup era. The red, black, and
                        white flag of Pushtunistan still waves today over Pushtunistan Square in
                        downtown Kabul. During coming days we will be able to provide a more
                        thorough analysis of these events as we see the new Communist regime become
                        established. The discipline we saw displayed during the anti-American
                        demonstration before our Embassy only a few days ago, on April 19, has
                        already translated itself into <pb n="21" facs="0066" xml:id="pg_21"/>political power. We shall be interested to see what the first Red May Day
                        in Afghanistan will look like tomorrow.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">In
                            telegram 3019 from Kabul, April 19, the Embassy reported that the
                            assassination of Mir Akbar Khaibar, characterized as a “prominent Afghan
                            Communist leader,” triggered an anti-American demonstration in front of
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy. The Embassy noted that
                            this demonstration “revealed for the first time since the establishment
                            of the Republic in 1973 the sizable, well-organized nature of the
                            Communist movement in Afghanistan.” In telegram 3416 from Kabul, May 1,
                            the Embassy described the mood in the city as subdued. (National

                        THE AFGHAN COUP</p>
                    <p>The Soviets almost certainly are ambivalent about the coming to power of a
                        seemingly pro-Soviet government in Kabul headed by a known Communist because
                        of the damage it is likely to do to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s position in Iran and Pakistan, and possibly in India.
                        Nevertheless, the Soviets apparently are doing what they can to improve its
                        ability to remain in power, in hopes of securing greater influence with
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets welcome the advent of a leftist government in Kabul, but they
                        know its Afghan Communist component has very little support domestically.
                        Their major concern over the short-term is that the new government’s naming
                        of Communists to top positions will not only galvanize local opposition but
                        perhaps also invite outside meddling. They also recognize that, in any
                        event, there almost certainly will be severe complications in their own
                        relations with other neighboring states.</p>
                    <p><pb n="22" facs="0067" xml:id="pg_22"/>There is no hard evidence that the
                        Soviets had foreknowledge of the coup, but they apparently have been in
                        contact with coup leaders since shortly after it got under way. An American
                        official in Kabul observed a meeting between a Soviet Embassy officer and a
                        coup leader outside the Soviet Embassy last Thursday night, and the Soviets
                        reportedly were sounding out influential Afghans last Friday on the
                        advisability of appointing <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> as
                        Prime Minister. Moscow has not yet confirmed Kabul Radio’s account of the
                        Sunday meeting between <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and
                        the Soviet Ambassador at which Soviet recognition of the new government
                        reportedly was conveyed. The <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> replay
                        on May 1 of the “Democratic Republic of Afghanistan’s” May Day pronouncement
                        certainly implies Soviet recognition, however.</p>
                    <p>Moscow presumably has been in regular contact with Afghan Communists, but the
                        evidence suggests that relations have not been particularly close. Until
                        last June, the party had been split into two factions, both of which vied
                        for Soviet recognition and both of which had relations with other Communists
                        and Communist parties in the region. Suggesting that the Soviets lacked
                        confidence in the prospects of the newly merged party, Moscow never formally
                        recognized it and reportedly was instrumental in persuading it to adopt a
                        policy of accommodation with the <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> government.</p>
                    <p>The Afghan Communists presumably will be more inclined than <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> has been in the last two years or so
                        to press the Pushtunistan cause in relations with Pakistan. The Soviets in
                        Kabul have complained about <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s
                        muting of this issue in recent years presumably because it lessened his need
                        for Soviet support. They probably would oppose a revival of the issue by the
                        new regime before it has had a chance to consolidate its [power?].<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">The last word of the paper is missing in the

                    <p>This morning I chaired an <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> Working Group
                        Meeting on Afghanistan. In attendance were <gloss target="#t_NIO_1">NIO</gloss>, David Blee, Rear Admiral Thomas from <gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss>, with Commander Zwart, and Peter Lande of
                        State who was acting as Deputy Assistant Secretary.</p>
                    <p>I used the agenda attached as a focus for discussion.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">Attached but not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>Most of the discussion was operational. The principal substantive matters
                        that arose were:</p>
                    <p>—Diplomatic Recognition. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        apparently wants to go ahead routinely with diplomatic recognition unless
                        the Iranians urge strongly otherwise and even then he may rather keep in
                        step with the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> countries than with
                        Iran. I said that you would want to have a voice in this and decide whether
                        the matter needs to go to the President. Most of us at the meeting thought
                        it would be wise to take fuller account of Iranian concerns and, if they
                        felt strongly, attempt to slow down our <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> colleagues.</p>
                    <p>—Covert Action. There was no great enthusiasm for covert action, particularly
                        on the part of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, which felt that it
                        would be pointless. Blee’s informal estimate was that the greatest period of
                        weakness would come in 6 to 12 months because of deteriorating economic
                        conditions. We discussed this at some length and much against his will I
                        instructed him to prepare a paper which looks at the possibility of covert
                        actions in the short term.</p>
                    <p>—General Attitude. There was a general consensus that this regime will be bad
                        news for us but that we should not take the initiative in breaking ties. We
                        decided that personnel should not be withdrawn from Kabul on an accelerated
                        schedule as proposed by the Ambassador.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3"><persName corresp="#p_ETL_1">Eliot</persName>’s proposal was relayed in
                            telegram 3453 from Kabul, May 2. <persName corresp="#p_ETL_1">Eliot</persName> cited “the emergency situation” in Afghanistan as
                            justification for his proposal, although he emphasized that a drawdown
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government personnel should not
                            be characterized as an “evacuation” because of the negative connotation
                            the new regime might attach to that word. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D780186–0713)</note>
                        <pb n="24" facs="0069" xml:id="pg_24"/>The one exception was the Station
                        Chief whose life was considered to be in danger. The general consensus was
                        that the new government should commit the first overt action. Our
                        recommendations in this regard would of course change if we came to the
                        conclusion that effective short term action could and should be taken
                        against the regime. We also decided to resist Peace Corps who apparently
                        have asked for permission now to increase their presence in Afghanistan as a
                        result of the new situation.</p>
                    <p>The following assignments were given out:</p>
                    <p>1. A paper on recognition which could if necessary be sent to the
                            President.<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">No paper was found. Instructions
                            regarding de facto recognition of the new Afghan Government were relayed

                            the <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss>’s present approach is to play
                            down question of recognition as much as possible with a view to
                            avoidance of seeming to approve or disapprove the new government.
                            Generally, once the situation has clarified, the new regime is
                            effectively in control of the machinery of government and of the
                            territory of the state in question, and other governments have begun to
                            recognize or formally continue diplomatic relations, we find an
                            appropriate opportunity to advise the new government of our intention to
                            maintain diplomatic relations. Recognition is not mentioned but may be

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Principal Judgments</hi></p>
                    <p>1. The Soviets welcome a Communist dominated government in Afghanistan, but
                        probably will be cautious in attempting to capitalize on the advent of the
                        new regime because of its internal fragility and the delicate equilibrium of
                        regional tensions in South Asia.</p>
                    <p>2. Moscow will work actively to keep the Communists in power in Kabul and to
                        influence the new government’s decision-making process. The Soviets probably
                        will offer increased economic and military assistance.</p>
                    <p>3. Because the new Afghan Government could face serious domestic threats in
                        the near term, Moscow’s major immediate interest will be to help the regime
                        consolidate its power. The Soviets in the near term probably will counsel
                        restraint regarding any adventuristic policies at home and abroad.</p>
                    <p>4. Limited Iranian meddling in Afghanistan seems likely, given the Shah’s
                        perception of a serious threat to Iran from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> via Afghanistan. Although Pakistan shares these worries,
                        it is less likely to become involved unless the Afghan Government revives
                        the Pushtunistan dispute over Pakistan’s western provinces.</p>
                    <p>5. The chances of a direct confrontation between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Afghanistan’s anti-Communist
                        neighbors remain low, although they have increased slightly. Both Tehran and
                        Islamabad will use the prospect of such a confrontation as an argument for
                        increased US military and political support.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>On April 27, leftist military officers overthrew former President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and installed a largely civilian
                        government controlled by the leadership of the pro-Soviet Khalq Party (the
                        Afghan Communist <pb n="27" facs="0072" xml:id="pg_27"/>Party). The coup was
                        executed in reaction to the government’s arrest of Communist leaders. Given
                        Soviet contacts with Afghan leftists and the armed forces, it is possible
                        that the Soviets learned of the coup in advance, although perhaps by only a
                        matter of hours. There is no evidence to suggest that the Soviets tried to
                        encourage or discourage the leftists, but Moscow and the Afghan Communists
                        have been pursuing the long-term goal of establishing a Communist government
                        in the country.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The New Government: Communist Background</p>
                    <p>The present movement dates from the early 1950s, when Afghan Communists aided
                        by Communists in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Iran, Pakistan,
                        and China, began a serious attempt to organize. The major impetus for its
                        growth and organization clearly came from the Soviets, who trained civilians
                        and military personnel in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                        Eastern Europe, and introduced Soviet military and technical advisers into
                        Afghanistan. Soviet clandestine activities and propaganda also played a
                        role.</p>
                    <p>Aside from a small faction that broke with the majority and formed a small
                        pro-Chinese party, there has never been any significant ideological
                        differences between Afghan Communists and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Afghan Communists, however, were never happy with the
                        fact that Moscow considered its relations with the Afghan Government as more
                        important than supporting the interests of local Communism. Kabul’s arrest
                        of Communist leaders, purges of leftist officials, and restrictions on
                        Communist political activity, for example, never interfered with
                        Soviet-Afghan relations.</p>
                    <p>Infighting among the Afghan Communists themselves—on the grounds of
                        personality rather than ideology—added to tensions, with rival Afghan
                        factions vying for Moscow’s support and the Soviets attempting to resolve
                        disputes. The present party is the result of the union last year—under
                        Soviet pressure—of two competing Communist parties, and there apparently is
                        still considerable tension between the two groups.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Consolidating Power</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan’s new rulers, despite their quick seizure of power and the
                        absence of any current significant resistance, not only inherit the weak
                        institutions that permitted the overthrow of the last two governments, but
                        lack some of the assets that helped keep their predecessors in power.
                        Central government authority is almost non-existent in some parts of the
                        country, and even in those areas where Kabul exercises limited control, the
                        government’s laws and policies have little impact on the lives of most of
                        the people. Although most Afghans would not be favorably disposed to a
                        Communist-controlled government, they <pb n="28" facs="0073" xml:id="pg_28"/>have little interest in who rules in Kabul. Politics, including coups,
                        involves only a small part of the population.</p>
                    <p>The popular reaction—either positive or negative—to a change in government
                        has never been a critical factor in Afghanistan; control of key military
                        units has been far more important. The last two successful military coups
                        depended initially on the control of armored units and the air base near the
                        capital. Neither coup was particularly well planned or executed, but in both
                        there was little opposition once the city of Kabul was in the hands of the
                        coup leaders. The new government will need to ensure the loyalty of key
                        units. The process may be difficult.</p>
                    <p>A hastily organized attempt to overthrow the new government with a small
                        force opposed to the new regime cannot be ruled out, but somewhat more
                        likely would be a gradual buildup of anti-government activities among the
                        tribes or among religious conservatives. Some increase in such activities
                        seems almost inevitable; the seriousness of the threat from the tribes will
                        depend largely on the actions of the new government and the extent to which
                        the conservatives win support in the military.</p>
                    <p>Several potential problems could affect the new rulers’ ability to govern the
                        country and cope with its fundamental social and economic ills. For example,
                        a split could develop between the military and civilian leaders. In the
                        civil sector, the probable removal of experienced bureaucrats in a purge of
                        rightists and officials belonging to or closely connected with the family
                        that has ruled Afghanistan since the 19th Century could quickly erode the
                        regime’s ability to cope with unfamiliar problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">A reference to the Mohammadzai family.</note> Within the
                        ruling party itself, longstanding rivalries between its two factions could
                        resurface, causing tensions or struggles that would deflect the leaders from
                        government business.</p>
                    <p>The mechanics of this coup were similar to those of the one in 1973, but the
                        result may lead to a much more fundamental change in Afghan political,
                        economic, and social life. The killing of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and members of his family and the immediately stated
                        intention of the new rulers to eliminate “every member of the family of the
                        autocratic demagogue” are ominous signs. Even if further violent reprisals
                        are not envisioned by the government, the removal of traditional elites from
                        official positions will adversely affect the operation of the bureaucracy
                        and government.</p>
                    <p>The new government lacks the legitimacy derived from tribal status that
                        reinforced both the monarchy and the republic. Since the early 19th
                        century—except for a short-lived government overthrown in 1929—Afghanistan
                        has been ruled by the acknowledged leader of the domi<pb n="29" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_29"/>nant family in the dominant tribe of the Pushtun ethnic
                        group. Although some of the leaders of the new government—including Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>—are Pushtuns, they
                        have no claim to prestige and respect on the basis of their position in the
                        tribal hierarchy.</p>
                    <p>This lack of experience and tribal status need not be fatal, but will make it
                        more difficult to deal with other problems. The new rulers are trying to
                        overcome this weakness. Their slaughter of <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s family and their denunciations of misrule by
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and his ancestors and
                        relatives is designed both to eliminate rivals and to discredit the entire
                        concept of selecting rulers on the traditional basis.</p>
                    <p>Probably more important will be the policies of the new government. Their
                        initial pronouncements, especially support for Islam and national
                        independence, are a clear indication that the new leaders are aware of the
                        risks of running counter to the xenophobia and deeply religious sentiments
                        of most of the population. Some observers believe that the Communist leaders
                        are basically nationalists despite their longstanding ties to Moscow. If so,
                        they might pursue a policy aimed at preserving at least some opening to the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>Any direct attack on religion in Afghanistan would be risky. Right-wing
                        Islamic groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, may increase their
                        activities and further assassination attempts are likely. Although the
                        government denies that it is Communist, popular suspicion of the government
                        will grow as word spreads that the Communists—i.e., the atheists—are in
                            power.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">Reporting from Kabul described the new
                            regime’s self-identification in more moderate terms. For example, in
                            telegram 3311 from Kabul, April 29, the Embassy noted that the new
                            regime was “still avoiding the use of obvious Communist claptrap.”

                        have brought strong reactions, and any major effort by a Communist

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iran and Pakistan</p>
                    <p>The probability of at least limited foreign meddling in Afghanistan is high.
                        The Shah of Iran has long argued that the Soviets are attempting to encircle
                        Iran, and to use their position in Afghanistan to break up Pakistan, thereby
                        allowing them the use of southwestern Pakistan as an outlet to the Indian
                        Ocean. The Shah sees the recent coup as confirmation of his worst fears, and
                        it is highly likely that he will order some kind of clandestine operation
                        against the new government. Iranian capabilities are limited, however, and
                        probably would become a threat to Kabul only if the government already faced
                        significant resistance <pb n="30" facs="0075" xml:id="pg_30"/>from the
                        tribes or the religious conservatives, or had become embroiled in a
                        confrontation with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Although Islamabad would be less inclined than Tehran to intervene in
                        Afghanistan, an Afghan-initiated confrontation with Pakistan appears more
                        likely. Moscow, however, would try to discourage Afghanistan from embarking
                        on any confrontation at least until the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government consolidates its power. The Afghan
                        Communists may well see a revival of the Pushtunistan dispute, which
                        involves the status of western Pakistan, where Pushtuns predominate, as a
                        way to win domestic tribal support or distract attention from any
                        increasingly repressive measures introduced in Afghanistan. Moreover, the
                        Communists have tended to press the issue, and have been critical of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s accommodation with
                        Islamabad. As Communists they would expect stronger support from Moscow
                        against Pakistan than previous Afghan governments, and probably would
                        receive it. There already have been a few indications—such as the flying of
                        Pushtun flags in Kabul after the coup—that the new government does see
                        Pushtunistan as an issue it can use. Moreover, a few of the leading
                        supporters of Pushtunistan in Pakistan are Communists.</p>
                    <p>Pakistani reaction will depend on how hard Kabul pushes the issue. The
                        Pakistanis are capable, in the absence of more aggressive action, of putting
                        up with propaganda on the issue although they would reciprocate in kind. If
                        the Afghans become too strident or too active, Pakistan can close the main
                        roads across the border, interrupting a large part of landlocked
                        Afghanistan’s foreign trade. Such a move would increase Afghan dependence on
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for a trade route. There is some
                        evidence that a serious tribal rebellion in 1975 was instigated by the
                        Pakistanis when they decided <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>
                        had gone too far in supporting separatists in Pakistan. Should the Afghans
                        become too active in support of separatists, Pakistan might resort to
                        punitive and preemptive raids into Afghanistan. The possibility of a Soviet
                        reaction, however, would probably deter the Pakistanis from a full-scale
                        invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet View</p>
                    <p>The Soviets welcome the establishment of a pro-Soviet, Communist-controlled
                        government in Afghanistan. In itself a major gain for Moscow, this
                        development is significant also as the first leftist victory in a year
                        otherwise marked by the establishment of moderate and conservative
                        governments in South Asia.</p>
                    <p>Moscow’s interest in Afghanistan predates the Bolshevik revolution. Over the
                        last quarter century, the Soviet Union has made a considerable investment in
                        its southern neighbor. Afghanistan was the first recipient of Soviet aid,
                        and is still among the 10 largest recipients <pb n="31" facs="0076" xml:id="pg_31"/>of Soviet military and economic assistance. The
                        Communist victory protects this investment and ensures that at least for the
                        near future, Moscow will remain—and probably improve—its position as the
                        most influential foreign power in Kabul. The Soviets applauded <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s coming to power in 1973, but in
                        recent years had grown concerned over his efforts to rid his government of
                        leftists and achieve greater independence from Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Since Moscow’s relations with Afghanistan’s Communists have not always been
                        close, the Soviets will move to strengthen their ties to the recently
                        re-united Afghan Communist party. The Soviets will exploit these ties to
                        influence any reorganization of Afghanistan’s party, military, and
                        administrative institutions. They will proceed cautiously, however, in order
                        to avoid creating undue anxiety in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>’s removal will calm
                        some Soviet concerns, it will also cause alarm about Soviet policy elsewhere
                        in the region, particularly in Iran and Pakistan. The Pakistanis and
                        Iranians suspect that the Soviets engineered the coup, and the Pakistanis
                        are again fearful of a “Delhi-Kabul-Moscow” axis, noting that India and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> quickly recognized the new
                            regime.<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">The Soviet Union was the first
                            country to recognize the new Afghan Government on April 30. India
                            recognized the new Afghan Government on May 2.</note> Both nations will
                        use the events in Kabul to try to elicit increased US military and political
                        support.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets profess to favor a calm and stable subcontinent with governments
                        friendly to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Tensions and
                        instability—the Soviets allege—create openings for greater Western or
                        Chinese influence. However, Moscow’s previous successes in South Asia have
                        been largely due to its exploitation of these same regional rivalries.</p>
                    <p>Moscow would favor the eventual creation of a Marxist state in Afghanistan
                        along the lines of a Cuba or Vietnam. At this point, however, the Soviets
                        are probably more concerned with the new government’s stability in power and
                        with minimizing the damage to Soviet interests elsewhere in the region than
                        in the ideological and institutional purity of the new regime. The Soviets
                        probably would be satisfied with a left-leaning, strongly pro-Soviet
                        government with distinct nationalist colorings. Moscow almost certainly will
                        press for greater support of Soviet positions on international issues, such
                        as the Asian collective security system, and will expect the new government
                        to refrain from any new initiatives toward Peking. However, it probably will
                        not in the near term press the government to launch any far-reaching,
                        radical reforms that run the risk of alienating large segments of the
                        population.</p>
                    <p>Moscow likewise will counsel caution regarding Kabul’s regional initiatives.
                        Aware that several members of the new government have <pb n="32" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_32"/>identified themselves in the past with Pushtun or Baluch
                        causes, Moscow is almost certainly worried that the new regime might too
                        quickly seek radical solutions to its border disputes with Pakistan and
                        Iran. Moscow’s hesitation would be based on its fear of jeopardizing its
                        attempts to improve its relations with India, Pakistan, and Iran. Moscow
                        probably would not approve any Afghan attempt to use the Pushtunistan issue
                        before the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government
                        consolidates its power at home.</p>
                    <p>Should Kabul nevertheless become embroiled in the Pushtunistan issue or other
                        foreign entanglements, however, Moscow would support it. Particularly in the
                        event of internal or external threats to the stability of the new Afghan
                        Government, Moscow would increase military aid, including the number of
                        Soviet advisers in the country. It is highly unlikely that Moscow would
                        introduce Soviet troops. In the event of a successful counter-revolution in
                        the near term, Moscow probably would be restrained in its reaction, trusting
                        that Afghan dependence upon Soviet military and economic aid would
                        eventually convince any new government of the need for a continuing close
                        relationship with Moscow. Moscow can be expected to continue and very likely
                        increase its sizable economic and military aid programs in Afghanistan.</p>

                    <p>10030. Subject: Soviet Perspective of Afghan Coup.</p>
                    <p>Summary: Soviet reaction to Afghan coup has been cautious but increasingly
                        positive. It is extremely hazardous to predict Moscow’s future policies
                        toward Afghanistan as a result of the coup. Much will depend on such
                        unknowns as Soviet assessment of (A) the internal Afghan political situation
                        and (B) Indian sensitivities about “outside” threats to Delhi’s efforts to
                        “regionalize” and “normalize” inter-state relations in South Asia. Based on
                        past experience, we believe the Soviets will work to help insure the
                        survivability of the new regime and, in the longer run, its consolidation of
                        power. At the same time, Soviets will be alert to broader strategic/regional
                        considerations (e.g., relations with India) and need to weigh these in
                        assessing how far they should go in assisting the Kabul regime. In the end,
                        the durability of the new pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan will depend
                        chiefly on indigenous factors and not primarily on the Soviet Union. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>1. The public Soviet reaction to the Afghan coup has been cautious, primarily
                        limited to straight news items, but increasingly positive in tone. The
                        caution is undoubtedly based on a Soviet intention to deflate widespread
                        suspicions that Moscow instigated, had prior knowledge of or directly
                        participated in the coup, and may also reflect genuine Soviet uncertainty
                        about the new regime. The Soviet press on May 5 gave special prominence to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s condemnation of
                        allegations in the international press that “foreign interference”
                        contributed to the success of the coup. We expect to see progressively more
                        favorable coverage of the Afghan coup in the Soviet press, with emphasis on
                        foreign and domestic support for the Afghan regime and the enhanced
                        prospects for social-economic progress produced by the “revolution”.</p>
                    <p>2. Moscow of course can only be pleased by the sudden seizure of power in
                        Afghanistan by men who have long been avowedly “socialist” <pb n="34" facs="0079" xml:id="pg_34"/>and pro-Soviet. In deciding its course of
                        action, Moscow will have to bear two main considerations in mind:</p>
                    <p>—The Soviets will not want their activities in Afghanistan to set back the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s broader strategic-political
                        interests in South Asia, which center fundamentally on good Indo-Soviet
                        relations. The Soviets realize that Delhi’s main foreign policy goals are to
                        “regionalize” and to “normalize” inter-state relations in South Asia, while
                        minimizing the potential for involvement in the region by outside
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>—Moscow will not want to encourage, through excessively overt Soviet
                        identification with the new Kabul regime, a “marriage of convenience” of
                        potentially anti-Communist/anti-Soviet elements including nationalist,
                        anti-Communist and Islamic forces in Afghanistan, which could coalesce and
                        threaten the new regime with a “counter-revolution.”</p>
                    <p>3. What will be Soviet short term objectives? It is hazardous to attempt to
                        predict shifts in Moscow’s policies as a result of recent events in
                        Afghanistan. Much will depend on the Soviet assessment of the internal
                        Afghan political scene, the degree to which the new regime turns out to be
                        pro-Soviet and/or genuinely non-aligned. Past experience leads us to
                        conclude that in the short run Moscow will mainly be interested in helping
                        to insure the survivability of the new leftist regime and its consolidation
                        of power. Moscow knows that this will be no mean feat for the new rulers in
                        Kabul, given the background of recurring coups and violence in Afghan
                        political history, and the degree of conservative and anti-Communist
                        sentiment prevalent in Afghanistan. We anticipate that the Soviets will
                        continue and probably increase economic and military aid, and work behind
                        the scenes to bolster the new regime through material support and political
                        “advice”. The Soviet “advice” probably will stress the importance of
                        continuing unity among the leftists and military factions that have seized
                        power as the only hope to establish the permanence that has eluded all
                        Afghan regimes in recent history. We believe that the Soviets will also
                        encourage the new regime to move quickly and dramatically to show economic
                        and social “progress” (e.g., confiscation of Shah dynasty property).
                        Internationally, the Soviets will seek to “consult” closely with New Delhi
                        on the Soviet reading of events in Afghanistan in order to reassure the
                        Indians of Soviet bona fides and to dispel possible Indian apprehensions of
                        excessive “outside” involvement in Afghanistan. Soviet propaganda will
                        selectively highlight the recognition and welcoming of the Afghan regime by
                        other countries, particularly those in the Third World and the Non-Aligned
                        Movement. Moscow will work through international organizations and its
                        bilateral relations with other (particularly non-aligned and fellow
                        “socialist” countries) to mobilize aid for Afghanistan. We agree that the
                        Soviets are not likely to encourage the <pb n="35" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_35"/>Afghans to heat up the Pushtunistan issue in the short
                        run, unless of course, this would be viewed as helpful in assisting the
                        regime to consolidate its control internally.</p>
                    <p>4. What will be Soviet long run objectives? If survival and consolidation are
                        the short run imperatives, we believe that in the long run the Soviets will
                        hope to encourage a steady strengthening of the Khalq Party’s base in
                        Afghanistan so that the party and not individuals will provide a firmer
                        foundation for future continuity and control. We anticipate that the Soviets
                        will also encourage the institutionalization of state-party control
                        mechanisms down to the grass roots level which are characteristic of all
                        Communist regimes. As this process builds, the Soviets will tout
                        developments in Afghanistan as a triumph of “progressive forces” and the
                        “world revolutionary process.” In this long run perspective, the Soviets may
                        also see Afghanistan as a regional “model” for other “progressive” forces in
                        the region seeking to capture power in their respective countries (this is a
                        role which Soviet party theoreticians like to attribute to Angola and
                        Ethiopia in Africa, Vietnam in Asia and Cuba in Latin America).</p>
                    <p>5. More on the Indian angle: Embassy New Delhi is, of course, in a far better
                        position to assess India’s sensitivities to a more direct Soviet
                        participation in the consolidation efforts of the new Afghan regime.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">Reporting from New Delhi, the Embassy suggested
                            that India was not well informed regarding the political orientation of
                            the new regime in Afghanistan. For example, in telegram 7475 from New
                            Delhi, May 11, the Embassy paraphrased Indian Foreign Secretary Jagat
                            Mehta’s hope “that the new Afghan Government means what it says about
                            non-alignment and good relations with its neighbors.” (National
                            Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy
                            File, D780200–0473)</note> We would note that the Soviets have willingly
                        and quickly sacrificed short term losses in relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and other countries to reap what they see
                        as long term gains through direct and massive support to new “progressive”
                        regimes in Angola and Ethiopia. It seems from this vantage point, however,
                        that the Indians would be very irritated if Moscow attempted in the long or
                        the short run to involve itself in Afghanistan (as it has in Angola and
                        Ethiopia) in a way that would indicate a Soviet intention to draw
                        Afghanistan into its own sphere of influence. It is noteworthy that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Desai</persName> government’s moves to
                        improve relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China
                        have made nature of Indo-Soviet relations all the more delicate. By
                        irritating Delhi through “over-involvement” in Afghanistan, the Soviets
                        would risk harming Indo-Soviet relations and increasing the possibility for
                        better Sino-Indian and Indo-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations:
                        a result which would be viewed here as most detrimental to Soviet strategic
                        interests in South Asia and in Asia as a whole. In our view, the degree to
                        which the Soviets directly assert <pb n="36" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_36"/>themselves will therefore be significantly influenced by Soviet
                        perceptions of possible Indian objections.</p>
                    <p>6. In sum, in our view, the durability of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul,
                        particularly in the short run, will depend chiefly on indigenous factors in
                        Afghanistan and not primarily on the ability of the Soviet Union to
                        influence directly events on the unpredictable Afghan political scene.</p>

                    <p>In response to the above, the President stated that we should build a good

                            Kabul, July 24, the Embassy reported that while the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> wanted the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid program “to continue in all the areas which were

                            because the new government “did not have its act together.” The Embassy
                            further explained that among the new government officials there was a
                            deficit of experience and reliability required to manage assistance
                            programs, an assessment shared by other Western powers and international

                    <p>Your interest in the possible implications of the recent coup in Afghanistan
                        and in my personal assessment of this event, has been conveyed to me by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">In telegram 4264 from Islamabad, May 1, <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> outlined a proposed

                        The correct assessment of the change of regime in Kabul and of its wider
                        ramifications is, indeed, essential to enable us to determine our response
                        to it. Your personal awareness of the importance of the new situation that
                        has arisen and your keenness to have the right answers, are most
                        welcome.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the events began to unfold in Kabul, we took the initiative to
                        consult Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> and have
                        remained in close touch with him ever since. We have in the course of these
                        consultations <pb n="38" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_38"/>also briefed him in
                        detail about these developments and our perception of their wider
                        repercussions in our own region and beyond. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>, no doubt, has communicated to you
                        our views which I hope have been of some interest.</p>
                    <p>Neither are the facts of the latest turn of events in Afghanistan obscure nor
                        is their interpretation a difficult exercise. The leftist coup in Kabul has
                        replaced a 200-year old monarchic tradition in Afghanistan with a
                        communist-oriented, if not communist, Government which was immediately
                        recognised by the Soviet Union and has its full backing. India joined
                        Bulgaria, the most subservient Soviet satellite of Eastern Europe, to follow
                        the Soviet lead without any hesitation or delay whatsoever. The collapse of
                        Daoud’s regime with which we were making good progress towards a settlement
                        of our differences, may have been welcomed in New Delhi. India is allied to
                        the Soviet Union under the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation of 1971 and
                        acts in tandem with it, at critical moments, despite the illusion of a shift
                        in its policies.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">The Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace,
                            Friendship, and Cooperation was signed in New Delhi on August 7,

                    <p>The facts of how the coup was engineered are not in dispute. Soviet trained
                        pilots in Soviet supplied MIGs and Soviet trained officers in Soviet
                        supplied tanks joined together to wipe out President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> and his family, in a swift and
                        bloody operation, closely following the pattern of events in Addis Ababa not

                        that he wanted a peaceful settlement of this border issue with

                    <p>The entire flavour and rhetoric of the new regime in Kabul conform to classic
                        communist norms. The country itself has been re-named the “Democratic
                        Republic of Afghanistan” on familiar lines. The regime’s lip service to
                        Islamic values and non-alignment is transparent enough. The need for such
                        camouflage to gain time for the regime to consolidate its position, is
                        evident.</p>
                    <p>If we go along with these professions in an effort to ensure the continuity
                        of the dialogue we had initiated with President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName>, this does not mean that we are under any illusion or
                        have been lulled into a false sense of security by the regime’s
                        protestations. We know that the Afghan barrier has been breached and our
                        country lies directly in the path of the flood which rolled out of Czarist
                        Russia in the last century and is now flowing in full force towards the
                        Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.</p>
                    <p>It is the nature of the response to this situation which is the subject of
                        controversy among our friends and allies. This is unfortunate because time
                        is running out. Nothing will stop the Soviet Union from pursuing its
                        expansionist policies if events encourage it to believe that smaller
                        countries are expendable in the overall context of America’s global
                        strategy.</p>
                    <p>In our estimation the advent of the leftist regime in Kabul is an event of
                        historic proportions. The change is of a fundamental nature which will have
                        a profound impact on the balance of power in our region and beyond. Its
                        consequences for Pakistan are incalculable. These and related matters are
                        receiving our urgent attention. I am convinced that these are of deep
                        concern to you also and hope that you will be able to spare some time to
                        give attention to the measures <pb n="40" facs="0085" xml:id="pg_40"/>needed
                        to meet an entirely new situation which has materialised earlier than we had
                        expected.</p>
                    <p>We are also in the process of comparing notes with our other friends. My
                        Adviser on Foreign Affairs is at present in Iran and will be meeting the
                        Shahanshah. For Iran the situation could be as grave as it is for us. It may
                        not be empty rhetoric to say that unless timely action is taken to block the
                        Soviet avalanche, the oil resources of the Persian Gulf and the Arabian
                        Peninsula may be lost to the West with consequences that need no
                        elaboration.</p>
                    <p>I am unable, Mr. President, to say in greater detail what I have to say in a
                        short letter. It is not possible to convey to you in this communication the
                        exact nature of the forces that may have been released by the transformation
                        of the Afghan scene. A fuller elaboration of this theme which is of vital
                        concern to us and I hope also to you, can better be undertaken through a
                        personal exchange of views at a mutually convenient time.</p>

                            respectively)</note></p>
                    <p>1. All the hard evidence that we have about Soviet activities in Afghanistan
                        since the April 27–28 coup and about past relationships between the new
                        Afghan leaders and the Soviet Union lead inescapably to the conclusion that
                        under its new leadership, Afghanistan has fallen into the Soviet orbit. So
                        far, we have only the words of the new leaders that they intend to pursue a
                        nonaligned policy. Their growing acceptance of Soviet involvement in their
                        political and military infrastructure does not support their words.</p>
                    <p>2. Moreover, I remain convinced that having achieved such a longstanding goal
                        of incorporating Afghanistan into the Soviet sphere of influence, Moscow
                        will do everything it can to keep it there. And, I see no internal or
                        external factors at the moment which could thwart Moscow’s intention.</p>
                    <p>3. The psychological-political effects of this development are naturally
                        being felt in other places, especially Pakistan, but also in Iran, China,
                        Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. I note a common theme in these other countries
                        that they cannot count on the United States to prevent further Soviet
                        advances in this part of the world. This despondency itself contributes to
                        an atmosphere from which the Soviets can benefit, and which can encourage
                        them to exploit further their bridgehead here.</p>
                    <p>4. Vital interests of the United States, especially in Iran and the Persian
                        Gulf region, are involved in this situation. I would think that our
                        credibility in Peking is also involved.</p>
                    <p>5. In the light of these considerations, I warmly second the recommendations
                        made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH_1">Sullivan</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Ref_1">ref</gloss> A).<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">In telegram
                            4547 from Tehran, May 14, <persName corresp="#p_SWH_1">Sullivan</persName> called for the United States to make a
                            concerted and systematic effort to demonstrate to its allies in the
                            region its commitment to their integrity and stability, lest the Soviets
                            be further encouraged toward adventurism beyond Afghanistan. (See <ref target="#d17fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above)</note> I think it is
                        essential <pb n="42" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_42"/>that we undertake a careful
                        review of our policy towards this region, especially toward the regional
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> countries, with a view to
                        bolstering their political, psychological, and military positions. I also
                        agree that we should consult with our European and Japanese allies, and with
                        the Chinese, on what they, as well as we, can do in these regards. An early
                        resolution of the nuclear reprocessing dispute with Pakistan is of
                        fundamental importance.</p>
                    <p>6. I am certain we can devise ways for shoring up our friends in this region
                        which will not be incompatible with a strategy of maintaining a relationship
                        with Afghanistan which will provide the Afghans with some alternative to
                        reliance on the Soviet Union, should they wish to have and/or be permitted
                        by the Soviets to have such an alternative.</p>

                    <p>1. As all of our contacts tell us, from General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> on down, the abrupt change of government and orientation
                        in Afghanistan is an historic event, pregnant with immediate security
                        implications for the nearby countries of the Middle East and South Asia and
                        with important ripple effects on the strategic interests of the great powers
                        in this area. Embassy officers travelling around Pakistan since the coup in
                        Kabul have found a sense of gloom and trauma prevalent in most of the <pb n="43" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_43"/>comments now being offered by
                        Pakistanis of all walks of life, and indeed, the nation—or at least its
                        opinion molders—appears to be in a state of shock.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">In telegram 4727 from Islamabad, May 12, the Embassy
                            reported that Foreign Affairs Adviser <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                                Shahi</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>
                            that recent events in Afghanistan threatened Pakistan and <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> existentially: “While you wait to
                            see how things develop in Afghanistan, we will be gone.” (See <ref target="#d17fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above)</note></p>
                    <p>2. To fully understand the meaning for Pakistanis of the change in
                        Afghanistan it is important to recall that for most of the history of this
                        part of the world—at least until the Europeans came by sea some 400 years
                        ago—Afghanistan has been both the military and cultural route into South
                        Asia. As the British Empire in India took shape, British policy sought to
                        seal off that route by fostering a classic buffer role for what was to
                        become Afghanistan. The replacement of the czars by Bolsheviks and the
                        British Raj by swaraj (self-rule) did not fundamentally change this
                        situation, and Afghanistan remained a buffer in a cold war context.</p>
                    <p>3. This is not simply an historical digression. Rather these are fundamental
                        facts which underly the thinking and the relationships of the peoples and
                        the states of this region, predating the Dulles and Ayub Khan eras but
                        incorporated, essentially intact, into our earliest security relationship
                        with Pakistan. When opinion leaders in this country now turn to us to
                        express their concerns and anxieties about Pakistan’s future in view of the
                        apparent loss of that buffer against Soviet Central Asia, they have in mind
                        these widely perceived historical realities and are reacting with gut
                        concern for national survival. Turning to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for reassurance at this moment is also something of a
                        reversion to earlier principles, since it was as an anti-Soviet alliance,
                        focused on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> (and Afghanistan),
                        that the post-war <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan relationship
                        was strongest.</p>
                    <p>4. If it were the uncertainties in the Afghan situation alone in their minds
                        it would be disturbing enough for many Pakistanis. But the change in the
                        role of Afghanistan may also have destroyed—for now at least—whatever
                        slender prospect there was for continued warming Indo-Pakistan relations,
                        described now by Foreign Advisor <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName> as “back to square one.” The quick Indian recognition
                        of the new regime in Kabul—however warranted in Delhi’s eyes and welcome in
                        Kabul’s—has rather quickly resurrected all the old shibboleths about the
                        Indo-Soviet relationship (based on their 1971 agreement).<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">India recognized the new Afghan Government on May 2. For
                            the 1971 agreement, see <ref target="#d16fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                16</ref>.</note> At the official level, and even more widely in the
                        country, there is renewed suspicion about what the wily Hindus are up to
                        this time combined <pb n="44" facs="0089" xml:id="pg_44"/>with a presumption
                        that it bodes ill for Pakistan. Even those Paks who perceive their own
                        paranoia point out that paranoids can have real enemies.</p>
                    <p>5. There is great disappointment among our Pakistani contacts that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has not said more in criticism of the
                        bloody events in Kabul at the end of April. Officially, we have been
                        pressed, bilaterally and in the <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>
                        context, for some concrete evidence of what we propose to do about the
                        change that has come about in Afghanistan to ensure that the pox let loose
                        there in April does not spread to Iran and Pakistan in the months and years
                        ahead. While as a practical matter, the Pakistan Government has publicly
                        adopted a wait-and-see attitude much like our own and Iran’s, Pakistan’s
                        leaders feel let down that even in private conversations we have had nothing
                        more to offer than a willingness to consult and an assessment which
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH_1">Sullivan</persName> has correctly
                        termed “thin gruel.”</p>
                    <p>6. Many Pakistanis want a close and continuing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> relationship of
                        trust, cooperation, and confidence, so our reaction thus far has been doubly
                        disappointing. Some will, of course, see it as but the latest <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> let-down of Pakistan, going back to our
                        support of India in 1962, our failure to aid Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, and
                        our pressure now to deny Pakistan the nuclear reprocessing plant it feels it
                        needs. Many also see it as part of a wider lack of resolve on the part of
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and outgrowth of our Watergate,
                        Angola, and Vietnam traumas; <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan
                        differences on policy toward the Horn of Africa will also be cited as
                        evidence of this lack of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> resolve. And
                        this comes from those who are still friendly to our interests here.</p>
                    <p>7. Those <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Paks</gloss> who actually oppose our
                        interests here and who have long sought to cut Pakistan loose in a sea of
                        non-alignment accommodationism may well see an opportunity in the current
                        situation to demonstrate conclusively that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is, in fact, an unreliable partner which has lost its zest
                        for the struggle. They will argue, as [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] notes the Foreign Secretary already has, that
                        Pakistan must stop looking to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (and
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>) for reassurance, but rather
                        must accommodate to the rise of Soviet and the decline of American influence
                        in the world.</p>
                    <p>8. Policy implications: I do not suggest or recommend that we be
                        streamrollered by events in Afghanistan into taking steps in Pakistan or in
                        this region to resurrect an earlier era of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> relations. The world
                        is a different place than it was in the 1950s and early 1960s, and besides,
                        nostalgia has a way of making that earlier relationship appear better than
                        it probably was. We have substituted for the earlier objective of
                        containment of Communism the more realistic formula of promotion of regional
                        stability. Events in Kabul have undermined that stability, and so far we
                        seem unable to think of actions to shore it up.</p>
                    <p><pb n="45" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_45"/>9. There has been a fundamental change
                        in the South-Asia-Middle East region, nevertheless, and whether the Soviets
                        prompted the Kabul coup or are merely the beneficiaries of it, the
                        perception is that the Soviet Union has scored an important gain in this
                        part of the world. That should be a matter of concern to us.</p>
                    <p>10. Our friends, in whose territorial integrity and independence we have
                        frequently expressed strong interest, and who rightly interpret that
                        interest, and our previous relationship with them based on our 1958
                        bilateral as testimony to our concern for their security can legitimately
                        expect a more visible sign of our concern than they have seen thus far.<note n="5" xml:id="d18fn5">A reference to the bilateral Agreement of
                            Cooperation signed on March 5, 1959, pursuant to a declaration signed on
                            July 28, 1958, by the Baghdad Pact nations. The Baghdad Pact was the
                            precursor of <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>.</note> As I see
                        it, we are now very much in danger of letting our tactical posture vis-à-vis
                        the new Afghan regime be a substitute for policy toward the region as a
                        whole. Our friends will not be to blame if they begin to draw the conclusion
                        that our assurances of the past lack practical effect.</p>
                    <p>11. It seems to me that we must find a way of acting in this region which can
                        serve to reassure our friends in Pakistan, Iran, and even India, while not
                        unduly disturbing the new relationship we are attempting to foster with
                        India, or challenging the Soviets frontally to our disadvantage perhaps, in
                        other forums. And we must somehow persuade Iran, and India, and Pakistan
                        that they now have more in common regarding the new situation in Afghanistan
                        than they have interest in their continuing mutual suspicions of each
                        others’ motives and activities.</p>
                    <p>12. The big hurdle for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy in this—at
                        least the most obvious one at the outset—is our nuclear non-proliferation
                        face-down with the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>. I do not imply any
                        diminution of the importance of this global goal of reducing the spread of
                        uncontrolled nuclear technology, any more that I would suggest we abandon
                        our human rights concerns here or in Afghanistan or in Iran (or even in
                        India) in the interests of regional security. What I do suggest, however, is
                        that we not hold our entire bilateral policy relationship hostage to any
                        single or multiple strands of our global foreign policies, however important
                        and worthy. To continue to mortgage our entire relationship with Pakistan to
                        the non-proliferation question—despite what has happened and may happen in
                        the wake of the Kabul coup—will be to promote the erosion of our last
                        remaining instruments of influence and prestige here in Pakistan while the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>—this government or the next one or
                        two or three—decides it must trim its sails to the new wind blowing from
                        Central Asia.</p>
                    <p><pb n="46" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_46"/>13. If we are going to have influence
                        in this region, it is because we are relevant to its interests and because
                        we are presumed to share some of its deepest concerns. Part of our problem
                        with Pakistan, even before the Kabul coup, has been this perception of
                        relevance. We press them hard on nuclear non-proliferation, as we must; we
                        express concern over their human rights record; we expect them to make
                        changes for the better in their administration of aid projects [garble—and
                        in their] handling of the economy. At the same time, we deny them access to
                        new and replacement military equipment in some critical areas, and we refuse
                        to commit new assistance or to sign agreements for which funds have already
                        been obligated. If, now, we prolong these largely self-imposed shut-downs,
                        Pakistan (and its neighbors) will draw their own conclusions. If, on the
                        other hand, we can be more responsive to their concerns, we may—in fact—use
                        this period to repair some of the damage in our relationship while at the
                        same time exercising greater influence on the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> to set its own affairs aright.</p>
                    <p>14. We are waiting, and must no doubt continue to wait for answers and for
                        events:</p>
                    <quote><p>—A solution to the reprocessing plant problem;</p>
                        <p>—the settling of <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName>’s

                        <p>—clarification of Afghan intentions.</p></quote>
                    <p>But let us not postpone all action until all of these and other questions are
                        settled to our satisfaction. To do so will further undermine, perhaps
                        fatally, our ability to influence events and achieve our policy goals. We
                        would like to see a stable, civilian government here, but in present
                        circumstances there is very little we can do to promote that result, and we
                        are losing the capability to have meaningful influence on human rights,
                        narcotics control, and economic development. All of these are high on our
                        list of goals and objectives, but unless we can soon find some areas of
                        middle ground between our hopes and the realities of the situation, it is
                        hard to see how we can make any progress toward our goals.</p>

                    <p>1. On 16 May [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] observed that
                        the new Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) was already suffering from poor
                        administration and confusion amongst its leadership. [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] noted he was particularly distressed
                        by the new regime’s lack of bureaucratic efficiencies and that each
                        individual leader is preoccupied with the task of bringing loyal members of
                        the party into key governmental positions. The party members are being
                        appointed more or less randomly and usually lack the necessary skills or
                        background to carry out their assigned responsibilities. [<hi rend="italic">6 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] also expressed
                        concern that the new regime was experiencing continuing tension between the
                        Parcham and Khalq factions; he lamented that these old antagonisms should
                        have been long forgotten.</p>
                    <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] said that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> was finding it
                        somewhat tricky to deal with the new regime. President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Nur Mohammad Taraki</persName> had apparently laughed
                        at some of <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>’s advice and had
                        stated that we will take decisions ourselves taking into consideration the
                        desires and benefits of the Afghan people.</p>
                    <p>4. The durability of the Afghan regime was also a concern of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. He noted that
                        there could be Western agents within the ruling Khalq Party and that after
                        revolutions there were usually subsequent upheavals until a viable regime
                        was finally established. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] observed that a continuing series <pb n="48" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_48"/>of revolutions had occurred in Iraq and
                        Bangladesh, and Afghanistan might not be any different.<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">A likely reference to the July 1968 revolution in Iraq,

                            Both cases involved the seizure of power by military

                        urging cooperation among Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India. Pakistan
                        remains deeply suspicious of quote Indian designs unquote and feels it now
                        stands alone. Pakistan needs a security guarantee as well as military and

                        noting that there had been an exchange of views in Islamabad with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy but he was disquieted because our
                        perceptions varied so much.<note n="4" xml:id="d21fn4">See <ref target="#d18">Document 18</ref>.</note> Pakistan believes there has
                        been a profound qualitative change in the regional situation; the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is on Pakistan’s borders. Pakistan is
                        following a correct policy toward the new regime in Kabul but that
                        government has served notice of its intentions with respect to the Baluch
                        and Pathan problems. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> cited the Afghan Foreign Minister’s statement in
                        Havana calling for settlement of these problems in light of their quote

                            Kabul, May 24. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss>
                            59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780218–0877)</note> The new regime
                        says it is non-aligned and it may choose to consolidate its position first,
                        but then it will begin subversion against Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>3. Pakistan has taken a quote independent attitude unquote toward the
                        Soviets, e.g., the refusal of the overflight permission for Soviet planes to
                        Ethiopia. Now Pakistan faces the external danger of having the Soviets use
                        the Afghan regime as a tool against Pakistan. In addition, there is also the
                        internal danger from leftist elements in Pakistan who may try to follow the
                        Afghan example. He claimed Pakistan already had information on subversion by
                            Afghan/<gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> agents in Iran and it may
                        reach as far as Saudi Arabia. If Pakistan’s intelligents see the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as the stronger power in the region he
                        fears for the future of Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> referred to his May 7–10
                        visit to Iran. The Shah, he said, is perturbed and wants to initiate closer
                        cooperation among Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>, however, has great reservations
                        about the Iranian tendency to go over Pakistan’s head to India and equal
                        difficulty in accepting the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Iranian
                        perception that we can loosen Indian ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Indeed, the Delhi-Moscow-Kabul axis has revived.
                        Pakistan, according to <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName>, is a
                        front line <pb n="51" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_51"/>state and needs help. But
                        as far as the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Paks</gloss> can understand, the Shah
                        is not prepared to give aid. The Saudis have promised but are slow.</p>
                    <p>5. In this situation, Pakistan stands alone. It may have to make some gesture
                        to the Soviets such as quitting <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>. If
                        the people perceive that Soviets can act adventurously and get away with it,
                        then there will be increasing pressure for Pakistan to follow an quote

                    <p>6. The Secretary, referring to <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName>’s
                        remarks on Pakistan’s standing alone, asked what kind of assistance it

                        asserted that the Soviets were threatening Pakistan by proxy as they did in

                    <p>4422. Subject: Is the New Afghan Regime Communist?: Evidence to Date.</p>
                    <p>1. Summary: Although the top leaders of the Democratic Republic of
                        Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) have Marxist-Leninist
                        backgrounds and their People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) possesses a typical Communist
                        structure, members of the revolutionary leadership continue to claim that
                        they are not Communist and that their government is democratic,
                        nationalistic, and respectful of Islam. Thus far, their actions have not
                        significantly belied their words, although these may be short-term tactics,
                        while the regime consolidates its grip on the country. On the foreign policy
                        side, the new Afghan Government has not taken any stance on non-aligned
                        issues appreciably different from those of the <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> regime. On the other hand, Afghanistan’s special
                        relationship with the Soviet Union is very clear.<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">In telegram 11903 from Moscow, May 26, the Embassy described the desk
                            officer for Afghanistan in the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs as
                            “defensive and reluctant to discuss nature and orientation of new Afghan
                            Peoples’ Democratic Party. He downplays Soviets’ links with and support
                            for the new Afghan regime and emphasizes Afghan view of India as model
                            for Afghanistan to emulate in its development efforts.” (National

                            90D320, Afghanistan, January–June 1978) Conversely, in telegram 4559
                            from Kabul, June 6, the Embassy reported that the Iranian Ambassador to
                            Afghanistan “sees the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                            regime as an intermediate regime between that of the <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> regime—which destroyed the
                            monarchy—and a full Soviet-backed Communist takeover.” (National
                            Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy
                            File, D780242–0104)</note> Economic agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are announced almost daily (about 15 so
                        far), while the only others signed so far have been one each with
                        Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Yugoslavia. Like its
                        predecessor regimes since the 1950s, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> is clearly dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for most of its economic and military support. However,
                        Soviet presence and influence in Afghanistan has appreciably increased since
                        the coup. On balance, while it is clearly in the Soviet sphere of influence,
                        there still is not enough evidence available to call Afghanistan a
                        “Communist country” or a satellite of the Soviet Union, although these could
                            <pb n="53" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_53"/>well become the eventual fate of
                        this country.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">The Embassy reported in telegram
                            4946 from Kabul, June 19, that it recently obtained a copy of a document
                            entitled “Constitution of the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan
                                (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>),” which clarified the new
                            government’s ideological foundation. The Embassy noted that “the
                            document, if valid, would leave little doubt that the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> is a Marxist-Leninist body and is
                            pro-Soviet. We believe that the ‘constitution’ is a genuine Party
                            document, but we are unsure of its date. We are fairly certain the
                            document predates the coup two months ago, and conceivably it is the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>’s founding document dating
                            from 1965. Whatever the case, it constitutes one further indication that
                            the organization now wielding political power in this country is a
                            pro-Soviet Communist type political party.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Bureau of Intelligence and Research,

                        <salute>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Your letter of May 9 was very helpful in sharpening my understanding of
                        Pakistan’s position in South Asia.<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">See <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note> I have also profited from
                        the valuable insights that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> has gained from his talks with you, and that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> has added from his
                        meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">See <ref target="#d21">Document
                        21</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Both you and I view events in Afghanistan with a similar concern for the
                        effect that they may have on the region’s security. I share your concern
                        with the political antecedents of the new Afghan leaders, and am equally
                        disturbed by their past statements concerning the Durand line. We agree
                        fully that Soviet domination of Afghanistan would be <pb n="54" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_54"/>a development of great seriousness for South Asia and
                        the entire free world. Those of us who share this view must cooperate
                        closely over the coming weeks and months.</p>
                    <p>We are under no illusions about the difficulties that may arise. We must be
                        careful to avoid actions which could seemingly provide justification for
                        those who seek to worsen the situation and limit the government’s chances of
                        maintaining independence. When faced by changes that may indeed be of a
                        historic scope, it is important that we all act with forethought and
                        determination.</p>
                    <p>The new Afghan government has declared its intention to remain non-aligned.
                        Your decision to maintain contact in order to test its willingness to
                        continue constructive foreign policies is a wise one. I, too, intend to
                        pursue this course as a first step, and hope we can work together in trying
                        to hold the Kabul leadership to its promise. Given these similarities in our
                        approach, I will value continued close contact so that we can most carefully
                        assess what the next steps should be.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of other matters on which I feel we can both profit from a
                        further exchange of views. I know that you too have been troubled by issues
                        which have arisen between our two countries. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> has explained to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> the real legal and political
                        hurdles placed in our way by Pakistan’s plans to acquire a reprocessing
                            plant.<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">Documentation on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> objections to Pakistan’s plans to

                        these difficulties, I urge that we both keep clear in our minds the
                        long-range interests and concerns which underlie our relationship.</p>
                    <p>For my part, I share the conviction both of my predecessors and yours that
                        our relationship is important to each of our nations. With this lasting
                        perspective in mind, we will be better able to solve the immediate problems
                        that stand between us, and build upon the fundamental consensus that binds
                        us. I am determined to do everything within my power to continue developing
                        our historic relationship of cooperation and friendship.</p>
                    <p>I believe, as you do, that a personal meeting would be helpful.<note n="5" xml:id="d23fn5"><persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> did not meet face to face until

                    <p>In the meantime, I suggest that we keep in touch through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> and, as needed, through direct

                    <p>[Omitted here are the cover page, title page, and a map.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS</p>
                    <p>The government of President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        that came to power in April 1978 is much more closely oriented toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> than have been previous regimes
                        in Afghanistan. The new government will attempt to preserve Afghanistan’s
                        basic independence from Moscow, but it is not clear that it will be able to
                        control the growth of Soviet influence in the country.</p>
                    <p>We have no evidence that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was
                        directly involved in the coup that brought the new government to power, but
                        Moscow has strengthened significantly its historically strong position in
                        Afghanistan. The Soviets’ near-term aim is to solidify the new government’s
                        control of the country and the expanded Soviet presence in Afghanistan—both
                        steps to ensure against any backsliding in the bilateral relationship. Over
                        the longer term the Soviets will seek to guide the new regime in the
                        implementation of domestic and foreign policies compatible with those of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s strength derives
                        from his control of the Marxist-oriented Peoples’ Democratic Party and the
                        support of critically placed leftist Army officers. The new government, like
                        its predecessors, has no widespread popular support, however, and government
                        control is <pb n="56" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_56"/>very limited in parts of
                        the country. The new regime faces rebellion from some Pathan tribes and
                        strong opposition from Islamic conservatives.</p>
                    <p>The survival of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government
                        will depend almost entirely on the military, and its loyalties are
                        uncertain. One or more attempted countercoups are probable, but it is not
                        clear that any will have organized the degree of military support necessary
                        for success. The Soviets’ expanded presence in Afghanistan and the
                        establishment in Kabul by the Soviets of a secure communications facility
                        will provide the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> with an increased
                        capability to intervene militarily on short notice if it should decide to do
                        so in the future to protect a pro-Soviet government in Kabul.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Unconfirmed <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> reports
                            led to this assessment. On June 7, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> passed along source reporting that “the 160 Soviet
                            military advisors who arrived in Afghanistan in mid-May 1978 have been
                            deployed to Afghan military units throughout the country.” The report
                            further noted that “the Soviet advisors have considerable authority; no
                            Afghan commander, department head, or staff officer will take any
                            important action without first consulting with his assigned Soviet
                            advisor.” (Department of Defense, Afghan War Collection, Box 7, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in Afghanistan (1978)) Another field
                            report, June 10, elaborated: “the total number of Soviet officers now in
                            Afghanistan is approximately 320.” Further, “of the approximately 65
                            general officers serving in the Afghan military before the 27 April 1978
                            coup, only 9 are still actively serving,” a development that the source
                            surmised would lead to “increasing dependence on Soviet advisors for
                            military expertise.” (Ibid.)</note> We believe, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will seek to avoid sending its own
                        troops to Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>The domestic policies announced by the new regime, if implemented, would
                        increase substantially the role of government throughout the society, but
                        they would not turn Afghanistan into a Soviet-style state. Priorities
                        include the redistribution of land and water rights, nationalization of
                        industry, and basic reforms in education and health services.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan’s relations with its anti-Communist neighbors, Pakistan and Iran,
                        will deteriorate under the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        government, but in the near term probably not to the point of armed
                        conflict. The Afghans and Soviets will exercise restraint with these states
                        to avoid jeopardizing the security of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime; the Iranians and Pakistanis for the time
                        being will seek continued correct relations in the hope of limiting the
                        growth of Soviet influence in the area. Iran and Pakistan will remain
                        prepared to provide covert assistance to dissident elements in Afghanistan,
                        however, if they see a reasonable chance to undermine the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government or in response to any
                        future Afghan involvement in Iran’s or Pakistan’s own tribal problems.</p>
                    <p>US-Afghan relations are likely to remain correct but cool for the foreseeable
                        future. The Afghans will want to preserve some tie to Washington as an
                        appearance of balance in their relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, but Soviet influence and the certainty that US assistance
                        will <pb n="57" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_57"/>remain modest compared with that
                        of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will preclude a closer
                        relationship.</p>

                    <p>By the summer of 1978, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> officials began
                        to assess the viability of various Afghan opponents of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government and whether or not the
                        United States should assist their attempts to overthrow the current regime.
                        The issue arose as a result of telegram 5047 from Kabul, June 22, in which
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">J. Bruce Amstutz</persName>, Chargé
                        d’Affaires ad interim after the departure of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ETL_1">Eliot</persName> until the arrival at post of
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Adolph Dubs</persName>, sought
                        guidance in responding to a “highly sensitive matter.” <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> reported, “I have been approached
                        by a major anti-Communist group, led by no less than the number 2 in the
                        Afghan military, to seek our advice on how best to proceed against the
                        present pro-Soviet, pro-Communist government. This group is considering a
                        military counter-coup and believes they can secure power in a matter of six
                        hours—if it were not for the Soviet presence. They fear the Soviets will
                        intervene à la Czechoslovakia unless the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (and perhaps Iran and Pakistan as well) are willing to
                        stand up to the Soviets.” <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName>
                        went on to discuss in detail his meeting with Dr. Mir Ali Akbar, Chief of
                        Jamhuriat Hospital, who claimed to speak for the Chief of Staff of the
                        Afghan military, an Afghan military officer, and a senior retired officer,
                        who together directed an unnamed anti-Communist organization with
                        significant popular support as well as military manpower and clandestine
                        “penetration” of the ruling Khalq Party. (Carter Library, National Security
                        Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Office File, Country Chron File, Box 1,
                        Afghanistan: 1978)</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> surmised that Akbar, in
                        taking the dangerous step of approaching the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy, was primarily seeking advice on how to proceed
                        with a coup clandestinely, so as not to trigger a massive and rapid Soviet
                        response. The group for which Akbar spoke, in <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName>’s estimation, was genuine and “not a <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-regime frame-up” and “represents
                        the only significant non-Communist opposition and alternative to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime.” On the question
                        of the extent to which the United States should advise and encourage this
                        group, <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> offered an historical
                        lesson: in the early 1960s, Washington rejected Prime Minister Daoud’s
                        request that the United States become Afghanistan’s major arms supplier;
                        subsequently, Daoud turned to the Soviets. “I am con<pb n="58" facs="0103" xml:id="pg_58"/>vinced,” <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName>
                        wrote, “that had we not spurned him, the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime would not be in power today nor would
                        Afghanistan have fallen within the Soviet sphere of influence.” <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> counseled a middle ground “of
                        providing encouragement and advice to this organization without getting
                        involved in another Korea.” (Ibid.) The telegram was attached to a covering
                        memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_TP_1">Peter Tarnoff</persName>,
                        Executive Secretary of the Department of State, to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName>, Assistant to the
                        President for National Security Affairs, dated June 22. The memorandum
                        informed <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>: “We are
                        consulting with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> on this message with a
                        view to formulating recommendations on how the approach should be handled.”
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> initialed “C” in
                        the upper left-hand corner of the memorandum. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>The following day, <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> received a
                        response in telegram 160507 to Kabul, instructing him that the issue was
                        being actively considered and that <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> “should take no initiative to contact the
                        anti-Communist group.” (Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and
                        Research, Intelligence Liaison Files, TIN 980643000018, Box 14, Kabul,
                        1965–79) On June 28, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Frank Carlucci</persName> sent a memorandum to Deputy
                        Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName>, spelling out the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> position on aiding the anti-<persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> group, which was “that no official
                        encouragement should be given the coup plotters.” But, <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> wrote, “we do recommend that
                        contact be maintained for intelligence collection purposes, and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> be given responsibility for this.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> reasoned that this
                        middle course could help the United States “influence events” and, while
                        acknowledging that the “Soviets will react very vigorously to any counter
                        coup; it behooves us to have as much advance knowledge as possible in order
                        to better manage <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations in
                        the wake of such an event.” (National Security Council, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration Intelligence Files,
                        Box I–047, Afghanistan: 8 May 1978–7 Dec 1978)</p>
                    <p>The possible value of maintaining contact with the coup plotters implicitly
                        acknowledged the poor state of intelligence collection in Afghanistan at the
                        time. In a May 25 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, National Security Council Staff member <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thomas Thornton</persName> summarized an attached
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> report entitled “Collection
                        Coverage of Post-Coup Afghanistan,” stating, “it simply points out that
                        things are pretty tough in Afghanistan collection-wise.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Two weeks later, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> produced two
                        detailed evaluations on the state of Afghan opposition groups, both dated
                        July 14, which <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> attached as
                        Tab A and Tab B to a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, also dated July 14. The memorandum at Tab A

                        assessment that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> retained
                        control both of Kabul and the Afghan countryside, but that violence posed a
                        threat to the current government, and the influx of Soviet advisers to
                        Afghanistan (totaling <pb n="59" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_59"/>approximately
                        2,000, including the 1,600 advisers stationed there before the coup) was
                        eroding support within the Afghan military for the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government. The evaluation also
                        summarized reports from numerous sources regarding a tribal insurgency in
                        southeast Afghanistan, and from the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        Station Chief in Islamabad who had been informed by Pakistani military
                        intelligence that approximately 2,000 Afghan tribesmen had crossed into
                        Pakistan in late June as a result of the fighting. The evaluation counted a
                        total of six occasions in which Afghans approached <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> officials claiming to represent groups opposed to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government, including one
                        made up of Afghans and Saudis known as the Afghan Liberation Front. The
                        memorandum concluded that while intelligence collection in Afghanistan was
                        improving, the United States might not have advance notice should a
                        counter-coup develop over the next several weeks, nor could <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intelligence ascertain Soviet intentions
                        vis-à-vis threats to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        regime. <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> noted that the
                        analysis attached at Tab B “goes over some of the same ground in more
                        detail,” and concluded, “I guess the question of giving a helping hand is
                        out of the question and am doubtful that we should in any event; the result
                        would likely be an invitation for massive Soviet involvement.” <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> drew a line in the margin next

                    <p>On July 27, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Stansfield Turner</persName> sent a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> reviewing the decision made by
                        the Department of State, the National Security Council, and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> that the United States would remain in
                        contact with Afghan counter-coup operatives, but would not assist their
                        efforts [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. The plan hinged on
                        the “quick elimination” of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qader</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>, and
                        Sakhi—which would effectively decapitate the leadership of the ruling Afghan
                        Government. Having taken advantage of the confusion caused by the death of
                        Khalq leaders, the report noted, “the counter-coup plotters believe they
                        have nothing to fear from the presence of Soviet advisors and can overcome
                        pro-regime forces within 24–48 hours but are concerned that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will intervene on behalf of the

                    <p>On July 30, the Embassy in Afghanistan, now headed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>, added its analysis to this discussion
                        in telegram 6128 from Kabul. In the telegram, the Embassy emphasized that,
                        although the reliability and identity of the Afghan opposition groups
                        remained an <pb n="60" facs="0105" xml:id="pg_60"/>ongoing question, “we
                        cannot exclude the possibility that a coup will be attempted in the
                        immediate months, if not weeks, ahead if the opposition groups believe
                        themselves to be adequately prepared or should their existence become known
                        to the regime and extinction become a threat.” <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> also believed that concerns of the opposition groups
                        regarding possible Soviet intervention were valid: “the Soviets would come
                        to the assistance of the present regime should there be a call for help,
                        should they perceive that the countercoup is ‘reactionary,’ and should time
                        permit effective intervention.” From a military infrastructure perspective,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> noted that the Soviets were
                        well prepared to take such action should they deem it necessary. He further
                        agreed with the consensus in Washington that the United States should not
                        encourage the counter-coup plotters, which “would raise unwarranted
                        expectations among the coup leaders about our ability to influence events
                        decisively in and area where our options and leverage are, unfortunately,
                        minimal.” Still, <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> concluded, a
                        policy of non-interference need not prevent the United States from
                        independently deterring the Soviets from intervention, or condemning
                        intervention should it occur. (Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence

                        from Kabul, July 30, that while there were many potential threats to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime, from both leftist
                        and rightist groups, a “paucity of hard information” hampered accurate
                        assessments about the real viability of the Afghan Government. “Only the
                        wildest rumors can be disregarded completely,” <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> commented. “Matters are clearly simmering and could
                        quickly boil over at any time.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780312–0956)</p>

                        was downplayed by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> later that year,
                        when again rumors of an impending coup proliferated in Kabul. On December 5,
                        an intelligence information cable representing the views of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s “senior officer on the scene,” reported:
                        “we doubt if there is a workable coup plan in existence,” and that the
                        “loose talk” of a coup around Kabul was not a secret to the Afghan
                        Government, which was taking proactive measures by arresting dissidents and
                        promoting loyalists. Noting that opposition to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> was no more organized than it was in May, and that the
                        Soviet Union remained committed to supporting the revolution that ushered in
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s rule, the December 5
                        cable concluded that “the longer this government stays in power the stronger
                        it becomes. It is sinking in its roots.” (Carter Library, National Security

                        preoccupation with internal reform and development as hallmark of new
                        government. They stressed intention to preserve Afghan independence and need

                            that the United States wanted to maintain good relations with

                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> that Afghan revolution
                        was internal event and that even Soviets were taken by surprise. <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> would be non-aligned and its long history
                        of independence from foreign domination was example for other Asian
                        countries. For its development programs, Afghanistan looks forward to
                        receiving assistance from its friends abroad, especially the Soviet Union
                        and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                    <p>5. Relations with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>: <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and others expressed genuine
                        interest in continued friendly relations with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (it was noted that three members of <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Cabinet are Columbia University
                        graduates). On assistance, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        repeated preference for commitment of large Soviet-style lump sum,
                        commitment from which <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> could draw for
                        projects of its choice. However, he indicated understanding of congressional
                        appropriation process and asked for list of areas in which <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could assist so that <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> could compare with its requirements under
                        five-year-plan now being prepared. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> said he would instruct his people to discuss details
                        of aid program with Embassy Kabul. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> appeared uninformed on <gloss target="#t_IMET_1">IMET</gloss> program and said he would ask Minister of <pb n="63" facs="0108" xml:id="pg_63"/>National Defense for briefing. He complained
                        that Fulbright program requires “hundreds” of applicants for only five
                        positions and said <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> prefers to name the
                        scholarship recipients. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> welcomed
                        any possible <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance and expressed
                            <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> willingness to discuss details with
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> technicians. Regarding wheat
                        project in Baghlan Province, however, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said that project would have to be reviewed in the
                        light of the new land reform program.</p>
                    <p>6. Relations with Pakistan and Iran: <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> expressed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> desire
                        for continued peace in the region. While not wishing to appear as an
                        intermediary, he noted Iranian concern over <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> attitude toward Helmand waters agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">Iran and Afghanistan signed the Helmand waters agreement
                            on March 13, 1973.</note> and Pakistan’s concern over <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> intentions re Durand Line and Pushtunistan
                        problems. He added that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> hopes to
                        resolve problem with <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> over reprocessing
                        plant, and, since <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> provides assistance
                        to both countries, we are interested in good relations between the two.</p>
                    <p>7. <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> leaders followed line that they want
                        friendship and cooperation with neighbors and seek understanding of their
                        revolution and technical and economic support for their development plans.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> said Afghanistan would
                        not bother its neighbors (and commented sarcastically that if he must pray
                        in a mosque or church to get help for his country he would do so). <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> need not worry that <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss>
                        would cause tensions in area. Afghanistan would attack no <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no state and would seek to solve problems
                        through negotiation. Since regime is new, it will take time for <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> to develop its positions on Helmand waters
                        and Durand Line, latter being historical problem between Afghanistan and
                        Pakistan. He recognized, however, that problem does exist between the two
                        countries over Pushtunistan and Baluchistan issues. This would have to be
                        solved by realistic negotiations but Afghanistan’s domestic priorities for
                        the moment are more important and it premature for <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> to raise this delicate subject with <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> at this time. On Helmand waters, <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> also needs time to study agreement and has
                        asked GOI to observe status quo. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> also said these issues under study. He jokingly said
                        after only two months in power that he has to study everything before
                        deciding what to do. For example, he said he had never in his life been in
                        the elegant room in which our meeting took place and he needed to learn way
                        around it and then gradually acquaint himself with the issues facing his
                        government.</p>
                    <p>8. Party-to-party relations: <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                        carefully explained to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> that
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> legislation contains prohibition on
                        aid to Communist countries. While term Communist not precisely defined,
                        Congress generally assumes that if a party in power considers itself to be
                        part of the <pb n="64" facs="0109" xml:id="pg_64"/>international Communist
                        movement then that country is Communist. He noted that Khalq Party had not
                        so considered itself in past but wanted to point this out as potential
                        problem to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance should <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> (People’s Democratic Party of
                        Afghanistan) establish party-to-party relations with <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> in future. Noting history of close
                        Afghan relations with Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        whether he expected party-to-party relations to develop. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> will have relations with all political parties in power all
                        over the world, such as the Democratic Party in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, on the principle that parties in power should deal with
                        other parties in power. He could not provide a further clarification at this
                        time but stressed that what <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should
                        consider is “what we are doing for our people not what we are.”</p>
                    <p>9. Domestic priorities: <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> leaders consider
                        their principal tasks are to serve needs of the common man in an
                        impoverished country previously exploited by aristocratic rulers. To meet
                        their internal goals they need peace within Afghanistan and with neighbors
                        and substantial foreign assistance. <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> is
                        preparing five-year development plan which it hopes to have ready by first
                        anniversary of revolution. <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> plans
                        programs which will bring about basic economic and social reform, and <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> considers land reform to be its first
                        priority. Both <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> were asked whether cooperative or
                        collective farms were envisaged. Both replied that small farmers would
                        retain their land (up to two hectares) and would be organized into
                        cooperatives. As first step in land reform, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> was about
                        to announce program for graduated abolishment of debts owned by tenured
                        farmers who had mortgaged their land to moneylenders and usurers.</p>
                    <p>10. Prisoners: Noting <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">Borel</persName> visit,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> raised subject of
                        possible release of imprisoned women and children related to officials of
                        former government. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> bluntly
                        replied that this was Afghanistan’s own affair and said “why shouldn’t I ask
                        about the prisoners in your country?” However, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said they could not be released yet because their
                        safety could not be guaranteed; he again indicated that there was
                        possibility these prisoners could leave Afghanistan. When <gloss target="#t_ICRC_1">ICRC</gloss> representative <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">Borel</persName> visited Kabul in early July he
                        visited prison but did not suggest release or departure for abroad.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">Borel</persName> was in Kabul again but
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was unfamiliar with his

                        the first new Ambassador since the change of government. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> warmly expressed his appreciation

                    <p>13. Message to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>: At
                        conclusion of meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>,
                        the President asked that <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                        reassure President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that
                            <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> is a friend of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, wishes to maintain normal political
                        relations and to receive American assistance to help achieve its domestic
                        development targets. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> told
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> that he would describe
                        the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> position to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> as seeking genuine non-alignment,
                        concentrating on the welfare of its population, and regarding international
                        issues from standpoint of Afghanistan’s best interest. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> agreed, but added, we will,
                        however, react to attacks from any quarter, would not accept any ultimatums
                        and hoped <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> would not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not be “pushed” from its non-aligned
                        course. If Afghanistan were, for example, attacked by Soviet Union, <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> would seek assistance from <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and any other friends. He had previously
                        noted, however, that Soviet Union had had good relations with Afghanistan
                        for sixty years and had not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not
                        interfered in Afghan internal affairs. Meeting ended with <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> firmly shaking <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>’s hand in both of his and saying

                        Present Situation in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>1. During my initial courtesy call on Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Alexander M. Puzanov</persName> July 16, he provided
                        the following answers and observations to my questions:</p>
                    <p>A) Soviet-Afghan relations: <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>
                        stated that there had never been any serious bilateral problems between
                        Kabul and Moscow during the sixty years since diplomatic relations were
                        established during the time of King Amanullah and V. I. Lenin. He observed
                        that the Soviets had enjoyed friendly, productive relations with the royal
                        and Daoudist regimes which had preceded the current <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government, and expected to
                        continue this positive relationship with the new regime.</p>
                    <p>B) Soviet military advisors: <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>
                        explained that the recent increase in the number of Soviet military advisors
                        here has been necessary in order to train the Afghans to use armored, air
                        force, and communications equipment being supplied by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He claimed that the rate of increase of
                        advisors is not so high as that which followed Daoud’s 1973 overthrow of the
                            monarchy.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">On the question of the Soviet role

                    <p>C) Soviet economic assistance: <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> explained that the forty-odd Soviet-Afghan economic
                        assistance agreements signed since the April 27 revolution were already in
                        the pipeline. Although most are related to the basic assistance commitment
                        made to former President Mohammad Daoud during his 1975 State visit to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, some date back to the pre-1973
                        monarchical era. <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> stated that
                        negotiations for these proposed projects had become stalled during the
                        Daoudist period for “a number of reasons.”</p>
                    <p>D) Projected bridge over the Amu Darya (Oxus): <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> predicted that the projected Hariatan Bridge should
                        be ready to convey vehicular traffic over the river frontier between
                        Afghanistan and the Soviet Union in “four and one-half years.”</p>
                    <p>E) The People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>): <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> did not
                        think that Politburo-Secretariat-Central Committee organiza<pb n="67" facs="0112" xml:id="pg_67"/>tion of the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> necessarily related the Afghan party to the Communist
                        Party of the Soviet Union (<gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>). He
                        thought that “all parties in the world” have similar organizational
                        structures. In reply to a question, <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> said there are no party ties between the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>. He explained that, after its 1967 split, the Afghan party
                        had dissolved into “political groupings” which could not be regarded as
                        parties. Since the Khalqists and the Parchamists only recently reunited,
                        i.e., in mid-1977, there has not been sufficient opportunity for the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> to react to this event. The Afghan party
                        had never participated in any international Communist meetings.</p>
                    <p>F) Membership of the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> Politburo:
                            <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> thought that there are
                        “either nine or eleven members.” During a recent conversation with Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Noor Mohammad Taraki</persName>, he got the
                        impression that the latter had not yet decided what to do about the
                        Politburo positions which had been occupied by (the diplomatically exiled
                        Parchamist leaders) <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> and
                        Noor Ahmad Noor. It is possible, he conjectured, that these two might retain
                        their Politburo seats.</p>
                    <p>G) Government decision-making: Although arguing that the governmental
                        decisions of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) are being made by the Revolutionary
                        Council, which he initially defined as the country’s “state and legislative
                        organ,” <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> acknowledged that
                        the Central Committee of the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> provides
                        overall political guidance. <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>
                        went on to describe the Afghan Cabinet as the “executive organ” and the
                        Revolutionary Council as the “legislative element” of the government.</p>
                    <p>H) Regional security: <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> noted
                        with satisfaction that there were no “border problems” between Iran and
                        Afghanistan. Observing that Afghanistan requires peace in order to be able
                        to resolve its domestic challenges, he asserted that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> endorsed the Afghan regime’s stated
                        intention to negotiate peacefully Kabul’s major “political difference” with
                        Pakistan (i.e., the “Pushtunistan” issue). <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> welcomed warmly India’s willingness to expand its
                        political and economic contacts with Afghanistan. He noted benignly that
                        Kabul’s relations with the People’s Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>) are “normal.”<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">China recognized the new government in Afghanistan on May 7.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> recalled that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> had offered the Daoudist regime a
                        60-million-dollar line-of-credit which had not yet been fully committed. He
                        cited as Chinese accomplishments here: Irrigation projects in Parwan
                        Province, textile-making assistance, and a hospital at Kandahar.</p>
                    <p>I) Afghanistan’s future: <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>
                        noted that impoverished Afghanistan was now working on a five-year-plan
                        which will require help <pb n="68" facs="0113" xml:id="pg_68"/>from as many
                        friendly foreign donors as possible. He was optimistic that the regime’s
                        goals will be met.</p>
                    <p>2. Comment: Although <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> was
                        obviously dissembling on some points, such as the influx of Soviet military
                        advisers and the structure of the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>, it
                        was clear that he was trying hard to portray post-revolutionary Afghanistan
                        as a country in need of outside assistance, as a nation which needs peaceful
                        relations with its neighbors, and as a non-destabilizing factor in this
                        region.</p>

                            in the SEATO Council communiqué of March 8, 1956. The relevant portion
                            of that communiqué reads as follows: ‘Insofar as these (Soviet)
                            statements referred to ‘Pakhtoonistan’, the members of the Council
                            severally declared that their governments recognized that the
                            sovereignty of Pakistan extends up to the Durand Line, the international

                    <p><pb n="69" facs="0114" xml:id="pg_69"/>1. Summary: Afghan Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> claims that he has evidence
                        that Pakistan is providing cross-border support for subversive operations
                        against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>). End summary.</p>
                    <p>2. During a call on Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName> on Aug 14 to discuss multilateral issues, I informed him
                        that I had conveyed to Washington and Islamabad the concern he expressed on
                        July 31 over the state of Afghan-Pakistani relations (ref D). I told him
                        that <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> had discussed this matter
                        with Minister of State <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>,
                        who stated that Pakistan was following a definite policy, rigidly applied,
                        to restrain and naturalize [<hi rend="italic">neutralize?</hi>] any elements
                        or individuals who might want to make trouble in Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_Ref_1">ref</gloss> C).</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> retorted that Pakistan was
                        “not putting that policy into practice.” He claimed that Kabul has evidence
                        of Pakistani complicity in a large number of anti-Afghan cross-border
                        operations to support subversion against the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_Govt_1">Govt</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> explained that his govt was not making this evidence
                        public at this time because it does not want to bring out into the open any
                        conflict with Pakistan if it can avoid it, and, besides, the Afghan <gloss target="#t_Govt_1">Govt</gloss> had contained such threats. If pushed
                        too far, however, warned <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, the
                        Afghans are prepared to publicize their complaints and take necessary
                        countermeasures.</p>
                    <p>4. When I asked what part of the Afghan-Pakistani border was involved in this
                        alleged infiltration, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> retorted,
                        “all of it—from China to Iran.” He hurriedly added that Afghanistan was not
                        making similar charges against Iran, which, he noted, has been controlling
                        its side of the Afghan-Iranian border “in a friendly fashion.” I observed
                        that there are many regions along the international boundary over which
                        neither Islamabad nor Kabul appear to exercise complete control. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> responded that his govt could easily
                        allow trouble to exfiltrate over into Pakistan from its side, but, until
                        now, has ensured that this has not happened.</p>
                    <p>5. When I described the recent Pakistani return of the Afghan MIG–17 as a
                        cooperative, friendly gesture of good will, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> acknowledged that Islamabad had indeed handled that
                        affair well, and commented, “we appreciated it.” However, this single act
                        did not, in his mind, outweigh the Pakistani machinations of which he
                        complained earlier.</p>
                    <p>6. While on the topic of Afghan-Pakistani relations, I reminded <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> that, as <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ETL_1">Eliot</persName> had informed him earlier, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> “recognizes the existing boundary
                        between Afghanistan and Pakistan as the legitimate international border”
                        (ref E). This, I explained, was implicit in our initial recognition of
                        Pakistan in 1947. Without making any specific reference to the information
                        conveyed in ref B, I alerted <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to
                        the possibility that he might see this <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        position reaffirmed publicly. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        made no comment. I also once more suggested that the best way <pb n="70" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_70"/>of discussing concerns which he expressed
                        was through discussions with the Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p>7. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is continuing to use
                        us to convey Afghanistan’s tough line to Pakistan while his govt apparently
                        avoids any direct confrontation with Pakistani officials at Kabul or
                        Islamabad. Perhaps this is to establish Afghanistan’s case with us, should
                        Kabul eventually elect to undertake some countermeasures. In spite of
                        everything the Pakistani <gloss target="#t_Govt_1">Govt</gloss> might be
                        trying to do, anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> operations are
                        probably still being supported through the traditionally porous frontier.
                        Such activities as exist may well be undertaken by Afghan dissident elements
                        who might, from time to time, seek sanctuary in Pakistani territory. The
                        Afghans presumably want to hold Islamabad accountable and force the
                        Pakistanis to increase their control efforts.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>As you are probably aware, things in Afghanistan are deteriorating rapidly:
                        the regime is devouring its children with amazing speed; its base of support
                        is narrowing; Soviet influence is probably growing; and there appears to be
                        quite a bit of spontaneous opposition outside of Kabul (not enough,
                        presumably, to topple the regime). We don’t know what kind of coup plotting
                        is going on; previous attempts ended in disaster, but certainly some Afghans
                        must be giving thought to it.</p>
                    <p>There is a serious possibility of Soviet intervention in case things unravel
                        too badly. <persName corresp="#p_TM_2">Toon</persName>’s view, reflected in
                        the recent <gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss> assessment, <pb n="71" facs="0116" xml:id="pg_71"/>seems too sanguine.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">Not further identified and not found. No cables from
                            Moscow were found conveying the Ambassador’s “sanguine” view regarding
                            the possibility of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.</note> I think
                        the Soviets are likely to assert their position in Afghanistan forcefully if
                        they see a counter-coup coming; they would be too fearful that a reactionary
                        take-over would be anti-Soviet and put a regime friendly to the US right on
                        their borders. Given the composition of the population on their side of the
                        border, this is an especially distressing thought.</p>
                    <p>State, with <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> clearance, has done some
                        modest contingency planning in terms of demarches to be made, etc., should
                        the Soviets intervene. Nobody has been able to come up with ideas on what we
                        should or could actually do in that contingency. Short of that, we can move
                        cautiously to capitalize on the one bright spot in the picture—India’s
                        recognition that the Kabul regime means trouble for them too. (A separate
                        memo is enroute on this.)<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                    <p>Another issue also arises: how long can we, in good conscience, continue AID
                        programs on the assumption that Afghanistan is not a Communist-controlled
                        state? I hope that we can continue to do so since, if there is to be a
                        break, I would like Kabul to bear the blame. If I were asked about this
                        under oath, however, I would be very uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p>I have no recommendation that you do anything at the present time. Mainly, I
                        want to make sure that you are keeping this unfortunate situation in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>You could, however, decide that you want to have an inter-agency meeting
                            (mini-<gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>?) to consider two
                            points:<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4"><persName corresp="#p_IKF_1">Inderfurth</persName> drew a line under “mini-<gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>” and wrote in the margin: “good
                            idea.”</note></p>
                    <p>—How close are we to a situation where <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s control breaks down and the Soviets intervene? Are
                        there any more imaginative ways of responding than we have come up with so
                        far? (The responses will almost inevitably be negative since State and
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> claim to have been giving serious
                        thought to this.)</p>
                    <p>—How close are we to a situation in which we have to accept the fact that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> is beyond redemption and
                        for one reason or another we should begin to pull back? (This, however,
                        would be a dangerous <pb n="72" facs="0117" xml:id="pg_72"/>question to ask;
                        we could find ourselves morally and probably legally bound to stop our AID
                            programs.)<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">Two handwritten comments appear at
                            the end of the memorandum. <persName corresp="#p_BR_4">Blackwill</persName> wrote: “Question is the forms Soviet

                    <p>1. Pakistan’s attitudes, and consequently its policies toward the Democratic
                        Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) are in the
                        process of subtle revision. The state of shock and alarm which we found (and
                        reported) during the spring, in the immediate aftermath of the Kabul
                            coup,<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">See <ref target="#d18">Document
                                18</ref>.</note> is giving way to a more measured assessment and
                        concern over the long-term threat. Indeed, it would have been difficult to
                        sustain the fever pitch of May and June in the absence of direct Afghan (or
                        Pakistani) provocation.</p>
                    <p><pb n="73" facs="0118" xml:id="pg_73"/>2. We do not suggest there has been
                        any lessening of anxiety about the future course of relations between
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan among policy-makers and opinion molders on this
                        side of the Durand Line. Most Pakistanis we meet expect the future of the
                        relationship to be one of tension, even struggle. Concern over more recent
                        events in Iran has done little to lessen the long-term Pakistani sense of
                        foreboding about the Russian threat to this part of the world and the
                        evident (to them) weakening of Western resolve to meet it. But no immediate
                        crisis has come, and events suggest more of the same.</p>
                    <p>3. The evolution of Pakistani attitudes is perhaps best illustrated by
                        General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia-ul-Haq</persName>’s decision to stop
                        off briefly in Kabul earlier this month enroute to Tehran to meet personally
                        with <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">The meeting between
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was reported in telegram 7312
                            from Kabul, September 12, which characterized the meeting as a friendly
                            first encounter between the two leaders that did not delve into pressing
                            bilateral problems. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780371–0979)</note> As
                        best we can determine, this was a typically spontaneous <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> move. Accepting that there would be
                        little gain on substance, the General appears to have over-ruled
                        [garble—his?] <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> advisers in order to have
                        a chance to take the personal measure of the new Afghan leadership as well
                        as perhaps get for himself a little breathing room in the relationship. On
                        both fronts, he appears to have been successful. He came away from the
                        visit—according to a senior member of his personal entourage—with a new
                        appreciation for <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s abilities
                        and the regime’s toughminded deputy, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>; and he is exploiting the exchange of
                        peaceful homilies to take a bit of the edge off the tensions in the
                        state-to-state relationship.</p>
                    <p>4. We know, from the Foreign Secretary, for instance, that the visit
                        reinforced Pakistan’s conclusions about the Communist character of the
                        regime; we know also, however, that the Paks came away believing that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and company have their
                        hands full at present with the difficult job of sorting out their own
                        leadership problems and of establishing their writ inside the country.
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> officials thus do not now
                        anticipate an early crisis in their relations with the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. This also suits General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s
                        political imperatives. Pakistan also has domestic preoccupations in the
                        short term, foremost among them a resolution of the <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName> situation.<note n="5" xml:id="d30fn5">A reference to the fate of former Pakistani Prime

                        less ordered political process which may be the harbinger of promised
                        elections. These concerns—plus a difficult economic situation—must engage
                        his full attention over the next few months, making more than ever welcome
                        the prospect of at least a pause in <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan relations.</p>

                        desires on both sides for a period of tranquility. One of these is the
                        refugee situation; we have commented (septel) on reports of a recent rise in
                        the number of refugees coming across, especially in areas not tribal.<note n="6" xml:id="d30fn6">In telegram 9243 from Islamabad, September 25, the

                            as not to further disrupt relations with Afghanistan. (National

                    <p>Begin summary: Soviet policy toward Afghanistan continues to be directed

                            Afghan specialist.” The Minister relayed that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was unable to foster a “true”

                            rivals to the ruling Khalq Party, would “return to power.” Conversely,
                            the Embassy also reported that, according to an Indian Embassy official,
                            the Soviets considered <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                            “as best situated to guide the Afghan ‘revolution’ between the extreme

                        End summary.</p>
                    <p>1. While the Soviets no doubt have the evolving situation in Afghanistan
                        under constant review, we see no evidence that Soviet policies toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> are in the process of revision.
                        These policies continue to fall broadly into two categories: (A) assisting
                        the pro-Soviet Afghan regime to consolidate the “revolution” and to
                        eliminate its opponents; and (B) drawing Afghanistan into closer dependence
                        on the Soviet Union in economic, military, administrative, and other areas
                        while maneuvering to reduce Western and Chinese presence and influence in
                        Afghanistan. As expressed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> in his September 22 Baku statement, the Soviet
                        Union—like the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>—intends to “widen and
                        deepen” Soviet-Afghan relations.</p>
                    <p><pb n="76" facs="0121" xml:id="pg_76"/>2. The sensitivities of regional
                        powers, particularly India, concerning Soviet involvement in Afghanistan,
                        the constant drumbeat of <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> charges that
                        the Soviet Union is attempting to spread its hegemony in the world, and the
                        potential for instability in Afghanistan will influence some degree of
                        caution in Soviet decision-making on tactics. The Soviets would prefer to
                        see the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime’s support base
                        broadening rather than (as seems to be the case) narrowing, and would not
                        like to become over-committed as the only benefactor and protector of a
                        leadership whose domestic political situation is worsening and not
                        improving.</p>
                    <p>3. Nevertheless, barring a real turn for the worse in the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime’s domestic political
                        position, the widening and deepening process in Soviet-Afghan relations will
                        continue apace. It will presumably include exchanges of high-level
                        delegations and an expansion of trade and aid, perhaps leading eventually to
                        an umbrella agreement with <gloss target="#t_CEMA_1">CEMA</gloss> similar to
                        those concluded with Finland and Iraq.<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5">The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> created the Council for Mutual
                            Economic Assistance in 1949, originally to oversee economic activities
                            in Eastern Europe.</note> At some future stage, it is also conceivable
                        that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> may sign a “declaration of
                        principles,” followed by a peace and friendship treaty. This pattern was
                        followed with Angola, for example.<note n="6" xml:id="d31fn6">Angola signed
                            a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in October
                            1976.</note> (We note, however, that the Afghan desk officer in the
                        Soviet Foreign Ministry carefully avoided responding to questions from
                            <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> last month on possible
                        consideration of a Soviet-Afghan peace and friendship treaty. He observed
                        merely that the 1921 Soviet-Afghan Friendship Treaty and 1931 Neutrality and
                        Non-Aggression Treaty provided an ongoing foundation for Soviet-Afghan
                        relations.) Meanwhile, we expect that the Soviet presence and advice in
                        Afghanistan will also be directed toward institutionalizing and
                        progressively strengthening the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>’s organs of administration and
                        control in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>4. As <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> did in his Baku
                        speech, the Soviets will also seek to assure other regional powers,
                        particularly India, that the growing Soviet involvement in Afghanistan will
                        be beneficial rather than harmful to regional peace and security. At the
                        same time the Soviets will overtly and covertly play up threats from
                        external “reaction” (the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, China, Muslim
                        interests based in Pakistan and Iran) in order further to buttress
                        Soviet-Afghan ties. Soviet diplomacy toward Afghanistan’s South Asian
                        neighbors will encompass:</p>
                    <p>—stressing to the Indians the common aspects of New Delhi’s and Moscow’s
                        policies toward Afghanistan;</p>
                    <p><pb n="77" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_77"/>—exploiting Pakistani and Iranian
                        fears by urging them to accommodate to the new realities in the region and
                        to forge closer relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>—insisting to all three that Soviet-Afghan relations pose no threat to their
                        own interests or to regional peace and security (a point <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> also emphasized in his Baku
                        speech).</p>
                    <p>5. Under present circumstances, we believe that the Soviets consider that a
                        rekindling of the Pushtunistan issue could be potentially unhelpful and
                        possibly dangerous to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s most
                        important mission—consolidating and broadening its domestic power base.</p>
                    <p>6. Our Soviet contacts have been very close-mouthed on Moscow’s attitude
                        toward the domestic performance of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime, including the purge of Parcham leaders and
                        the pace of socio-economic programs in Afghanistan. As previously reported,
                        some of our Soviet sources and Soviet press articles have implied that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s “cocktail socialism”
                        (perhaps like Allende’s reforms) lack decisiveness and drive, and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> should not have purged
                        Parcham leaders. In general, it appears from here that currently the Soviets
                        intend to stick with <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> “for
                        better or for worse” as the best bet to preserve and widen the over-all
                        course of the Afghan “revolution.” This situation could change if opposition
                        to his regime reached serious proportions and his personal position became
                        increasingly tenuous. In such event, we believe that Moscow would not
                        hesitate to abandon <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and to
                        look for other leadership options.</p>
                    <p>7. If the Afghan “revolution” survives the consolidation period, the Soviets
                        will probably then move more boldly to make the direction of Afghan-Soviet
                        relations irreversible. Over the long run, if Afghanistan should move onto
                        the “Socialist path,” Moscow will conceive of Afghanistan increasingly as a
                        state entitled to Soviet protection, consistent with the Soviet Union’s
                        self-proclaimed duty to use its power in the common defense of “Socialist
                        gains.”</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> has consolidated his
                        position in the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan and in the
                        government. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has
                        emerged as the second most important person in the country.</p>
                    <p>Working through <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> is attempting to control the
                        military through the small minority of completely loyal officers. They may
                        be in a position to keep him better informed than any of his predecessors
                        about coup plotting.</p>
                    <p>Control of the military remains the key to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s survival. His government, like its predecessors, is
                        weak, and his sudden overthrow by a small group of military officers cannot
                        be completely discounted.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing to indicate that distrust of his government on religious
                        grounds has abated. Tribal rebellions are spreading, and should
                        antigovernment activity increase significantly, the willingness of the
                        military to carry out the government’s orders could be seriously
                        affected.</p>
                    <p>In foreign policy and their public statements the Afghan leaders have moved
                        closer to the Moscow line. They have, however, done little to implement
                        domestic programs that could be labeled Communist, presumably to avoid
                        risking adverse popular reaction but also in part because they lack the
                        resources to do so.</p>
                    <p>The degree, if any, to which <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        is independent of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has not so far
                        been tested by significant differences between Moscow and Kabul. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> may believe he needs Soviet backing
                        to survive and the Soviet role in Afghanistan continues to increase.</p>

                    <p>9599. Subject: Afghan-Soviet Relations on the Eve of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s Trip to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>1. Summary: <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Noor Mohammad Taraki</persName>,
                        Afghanistan’s President and Prime Minister, departed Kabul on December 4 to
                        visit the Soviet Union. In many ways it is fitting that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s first trip outside Afghanistan
                        since the April 27 revolution should be to Moscow. The pro-Soviet views of
                        the Afghan leadership have become increasingly apparent recently, a
                        development which may stem from deep ideological convictions, as well as
                        this regime’s genuine and increasing need for Soviet support in several
                        fields. Aside from the symbolic and public relations aspects of the
                        trip—which are significant in their own right, the Afghan delegation will
                        probably raise a number of issues, which, if Moscow is reasonably
                        forthcoming, could solidify the already close bilateral relationship,
                        especially the link between the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan
                            (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) and the Communist Party of the
                        Soviet Union (<gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>). The capstone of the
                        visit could be the signing of a new bilateral <pb n="80" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_80"/>treaty—a step which would, from the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s vantage point, represent a complete
                        break with past Afghan regimes and would codify the two countries’ special
                            relationship.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">The Soviet-Afghan Friendship
                            Treaty, signed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> in Moscow, December
                            5, was reported in telegram 30123 from Moscow, December 7. The Embassy
                            noted that the treaty covered “cooperation in the military, political,
                            economic, scientific, and cultural fields” and committed both countries
                            to “open-ended” consultations on security issues. (National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                            for <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> on the significance
                            of the treaty: “The traditional good relations between our two countries
                            have assumed, I would say, a qualitatively new character.” (National

                            Administration Intelligence Files, Box I–47, Afghanistan: 8 May 1978–7
                            Dec 1978)</note> We have no firm evidence, however, that this subject
                        has been under active consideration by either party. The Afghans are also
                        expected to ask the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for food and
                        increased economic assistance. We anticipate that Moscow will not want their
                        guests to go away empty-handed, and that the visit will, therefore, produce
                        some concrete results which would help to identify the future direction of
                        this rapidly developing relationship. End of summary.</p>
                    <p>2. Departure of the Afghan party: <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was accompanied by the following Cabinet officers
                        (names are in the order listed in the official media): <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>, Deputy Prime Minister and
                        Foreign Minister; Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName>,
                        Minister of Public Health and Acting Minister of Planning; Dr. Saleh
                        Mohammad Ziri, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reform; Professor Mahmud
                        Sooma, Minister of Higher Education; Mohammad Mansoor Hashimi, Minister of
                        Water and Power; Eng. Mohammad Ismail Danesh, Minister of Mines and
                        Industries; and <persName corresp="#p_GSM_1">Sayed Mohammad
                            Gulabzoi</persName>, Minister of Communications. With the exception of
                        the last three men, all members of the travelling party are members of the
                            <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> Politburo. The “pecking order” of
                        the top officials bidding farewell to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> party was: Dastagir Panjshiri, Minister of Public
                        Works; Abdul Karim Misaq, Minister of Finance; Major <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Mohammad Awlam Watanjar</persName>, Minister of
                        Interior; Abdul Hakem Sharaie Jauzjani, Minister of Justice and
                        Attorney-General; Mohammad Hassen Bareq-Shafiee, Minister of Culture and
                        Information; Abdul Qudus Ghorbandi, Minister of Commerce; and Dr. Abdul
                        Rashid Jalili, Minister of Education. Panjshiri and Misaq are known members
                        of the Politburo. When the Ambassador asked one protocol official who has
                        been left in charge, the reply was “<persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>.” The Chief of Protocol later told the Ambassador
                        that the Revolutionary Council was in charge of Afghanistan collectively—and
                        that any urgent important problems would be forwarded to Moscow for
                        decisions. (We find this version more credible; <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName> appears to lack sufficient presence or intelligence
                        for the “charge” role.) In trying to set up top-level appointments <pb n="81" facs="0126" xml:id="pg_81"/>for visiting <gloss target="#t_USAID_1">USAID</gloss> official Wheeler, the Embassy’s
                        protocol officer has been told that the Afghan party will return to Kabul on
                        December 7.</p>
                    <p>3. The Afghan view of the Soviet connection: The pro-Moscow mind set of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his closest advisors,
                        particularly his two principal lieutenants, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> and Acting Planning
                        Minister Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName>, has been well
                        documented since the April 27 revolution, both through domestic
                        pronouncements and by high-level speeches before international fora. In the
                        initial post-revolutionary period, however, the leadership generally tried
                        to camouflage its pro-Soviet views with explanations that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Afghanistan have had good and
                        friendly relations for decades, and that the new regime in Kabul was merely
                        carrying on in the same tradition. The Khalqi leaders publicly denied that
                        their <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> was “Communist,” “Socialist,”
                        or “Marxist-Leninist,” although they admitted its Marxist-Leninist character
                        in private fora.</p>
                    <p>4. In recent weeks, however, a deeper pro-Soviet attitude has emerged from
                        the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> closet; the Afghan leadership has
                        made no effort to disguise its belief that Kabul’s relationship with Moscow
                        is of overriding importance, not only in the foreign policy field, but also
                        probably domestically as well. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s
                        November 7 speech, which portrayed Afghanistan’s Saur revolution of April 27
                        as an historical extension of the “great October revolution” (Kabul 9145)
                        was typical of the obsequious degree to which <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his colleagues are willing to reveal their
                        political convictions.<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">In telegram 9145 from
                            Kabul, November 15, the Embassy characterized the speech as “obsequious
                            and effusive.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss>
                            59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780471–0343)</note> In this
                        connection, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> himself took the
                        unprecedented and well-publicized step of attending (with virtually the
                        entire Afghan Cabinet) the November 7 Soviet National Day reception, a far
                        cry from the regime’s standard practice of sending one minister to the
                        similar celebrations of other countries. Most recently, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, in his lengthy speech to the
                        plenum of the Party’s Central Committee echoed the Soviet line of
                        international issues, ranging from the inevitable victory of socialism over
                        imperialism to support for Vietnam in its struggle against intrigue by its
                            neighbors.<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">In telegram 9531 from Kabul,
                            December 3, the Embassy reported on <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s November 27 speech. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                        indicate a desire to involve the Soviets more intensively in the tertiary
                        education field to ensure ideological purity and harmony in a critical area
                        which has heretofore been an arena for extensive American participation and
                        influence.</p>
                    <p><pb n="82" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_82"/>5. Reasons for the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s pro-Soviet attitudes: The primary well
                        from which the strong leftist views of this regime’s leaders spring is their
                        long-held beliefs in the tenets of Marxism-Leninism, and a probably more
                        recently acquired conviction that the world correlation of forces and events
                        is evolving in such a way that the ultimate victory of Marxism-Leninism
                        cannot be denied. Although the Afghan leadership’s grasp of many of the
                        arcane principles of this doctrine has come under polite fire by a number of
                        visiting Third World officials (e.g., Indian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VAB_1">Vajpayee</persName>), in our assessment <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his colleagues are sincere in
                        their devotion to this ideology and in their belief that Marxism-Leninism
                        contains the ultimate answers on how to modernize Afghanistan’s feudal
                        society. They also display full trust and confidence in the Soviet Union as
                        their sole support and defense at this vulnerable stage of consolidation.
                        There is no indication that they see any unacceptable risks to their
                        independence in this relationship. Indeed, an ideologue like <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> would probably describe Outer Mongolia
                        as an “independent” state. The Khalqi perception of Afghan independence is
                        different from the classical stance taken by other Afghans.</p>
                    <p>6. Afghan security needs: Simultaneously, there is a practical side to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s view of politics, and this element
                        of the equation may account, to a greater extent, for the recent pro-Soviet
                        developments noted above, and may also determine the primary significance of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s trip to Moscow.
                        Although the accession of a leftist regime in Kabul has undoubtedly served a
                        number of important Soviet foreign policy and ideological interests, one
                        could make a strong argument that, at this stage of the game at least, the
                        Afghan leadership needs the Soviets more than the latter needs Kabul’s
                        possible contributions. The security of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime has not yet been fully established, despite
                        the Afghan leader’s confident remarks in his November 27 address to his
                        party colleagues. Active opposition, especially in the eastern tribal areas,
                        appears to be inadequate to overcome the military force and ruthless
                        determination of the Khalqi regime. Nevertheless, it refuses to go away or
                        be stamped out. Rightly or wrongly, it is widely perceived here that Moscow
                        has undertaken a bottom-line commitment (some believe to the extent that it
                        would provide para-military forces if necessary) to the survival of a
                        leftist regime in Kabul, a perception that probably serves to intimidate
                        somewhat any potential domestic opporition—or any Pakistani inclination to
                        contribute to this subversion. Thus, in the crucial security field the
                        possibility that the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime
                        might at some point be able to exercise the “Soviet option” is from Kabul’s
                        point of view an indispensable factor in Kabul’s bilateral relationship with
                        Moscow—and, for that matter, with Islamabad, as well.</p>
                    <p>7. Regional politics: On the broader foreign policy front, Moscow’s presence
                        in the wings is probably a comforting one for the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leader<pb n="83" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_83"/>ship,
                        especially as it formulates its policies toward Pakistan and Iran. There is
                        a trade-off here, however, as the Afghans conceivably could find themselves
                        not completely free agents should Moscow, for its own purposes, decide to
                        exercise a restraining hand over possible irredentist Afghan tendencies
                        vis-à-vis the Pushtun and Baluch regions of Pakistan, or any Afghan
                        inclination to reheat the Helmand waters dispute with Iran. Nevertheless,
                        the Afghans could well use a commitment from Moscow that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would extricate Afghan chestnuts in the
                        event <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> might overplay his hand
                        and provoke a strong Pakistani reaction of some sort. Many observers here
                        believe that such a commitment has already been given, even if only tacitly.
                        From the Soviet viewpoint, the Afghan potential for making trouble for Iran
                        and Pakistan in Baluchistan remains an important card in Moscow’s hand.
                        Moscow might, therefore, consider some statement of support for Afghan
                        concern for its “Pushtun and Baluch brethren.”</p>
                    <p>8. Economic needs: Also of immediate concern to the Afghan leadership is the
                        extent to which Moscow would be willing to underwrite Afghanistan’s economic
                        development should Kabul’s stand on international issues and its approach to
                        bilateral programs provoke a reduction of Western or Arab-Iranian
                        assistance. The presence of several “economic” ministers in the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> party signals a long Afghan
                        shopping list. Although no non-Communist country has as yet significantly
                        cut its operations here, radical or rigid Afghan policies could create a
                        situation in which Moscow and its Socialist colleagues would be the only
                        donor countries willing to invest economic resources in Afghanistan, a
                        possibility which could well have provoked the Afghan leadership’s recent
                        pro-Soviet displays. A Soviet diplomat in Kabul recently told an Indian
                        diplomat that the Socialist Bloc is prepared and able to shoulder the entire
                        development burden in Afghanistan should the West elect to quit the field
                        (Kabul 8970).<note n="5" xml:id="d33fn5">Telegram 8970 from Kabul is dated
                            November 8. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,
                            Central Foreign Policy File, D780461–0225)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s delegation might also ask
                        the Soviets to support Afghanistan’s food needs during the current testing
                        period when oppositionists are successfully withholding key commodities,
                        such as flour, from the market. Although Moscow may be unwilling to satisfy
                        each Afghan request to the letter, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his colleagues will probably not come away
                        empty-handed. It is possible that the Soviets might utilize this occasion to
                        announce another large credit for Afghan development. We presume that the
                        Soviets are fully cognizant of the crucial supporting role they play here,
                        and that they will want to reassure, to an extent consistent with their own
                        assessment of the relationship, the Afghan leadership that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his colleagues can count on
                        Moscow’s backing on several fronts.</p>
                    <p><pb n="84" facs="0129" xml:id="pg_84"/>9. Increased Afghan-Soviet ties: The
                        Afghans will also possibly seek the establishment of some sort of “official”
                        tie between the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> and Kabul’s ruling
                            <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> strongly alluded to this possible development in his
                        November 27 speech to the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> Central
                        Committee plenum when he said that during the Soviet [visit] the Afghans
                        would “study and take decisions on the relations between the parties of the
                        two countries” (septel).<note n="6" xml:id="d33fn6">The Embassy commented
                            futher on the November 27 speech in telegram 9616 from Kabul, December

                            Foreign Policy File, D780504–0134)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> will also probably seek some
                        sort of Soviet public endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s policies to date, undoubtedly including some nice words
                        regarding the Afghan leadership’s performance. General Soviet expressions of
                        support for the regime’s domestic policies and reform measures are probably
                        the minimum the Afghans expect to emerge from the trip.</p>
                    <p>10. The potentially critical Soviet role in guaranteeing this regime’s
                        security will unquestionably be high on the agenda of these talks, but we
                        anticipate that the substance of these discussions will be closely held and
                        that the issue may not arise in public statements or reports. Both parties
                        may be content with the current magnitude of Soviet presence in Afghanistan
                        (best estimates are that approximately 600 Soviet military advisors are
                        serving here, while about 2,000 Soviet civilians are employed throughout the
                        government’s bureaucracy), and that further augmentations are unnecessary to
                        deal with the present level of Afghan needs.</p>
                    <p>11. Finally, the visit conceivably could produce a new bilateral treaty of
                        some sort to replace the current 1931 Treaty of Neutrality and Mutual
                        Non-Aggression which was most recently extended for ten years at the time of
                        Nikolai Podgorny’s visit here in December of 1975.<note n="7" xml:id="d33fn7">In telegram 18473 from Moscow, December 29, 1975, the
                            Embassy reported on Podgorny’s December 9–10 trip to Afghanistan, the
                            main purpose of which was to renew the 1931 agreement. (National

                            File, D750449–0163)</note> Although both sides, especially the Soviets,
                        could probably live with the legal status quo governing their relationship,
                        the Khalqis may raise the subject because, in their minds, the 1931 treaty
                        could represent a “relic” of the past, it does not commit Moscow to protect
                        Afghanistan’s security in the event of aggression by some “foreign power,”
                        and a new accord would constitute a dramatic symbol of the “new
                        relationship” which the Afghan leadership is so eager to flaunt. The timing
                        of this visit may find the Soviets in a treaty-signing mood, although for a
                        number of reasons (e.g., reluctance to endorse too fully this particular
                        leadership, concern about alarming unduly the other countries of South
                        Asia—especially India, and a general hesitance to modify legal relation<pb n="85" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_85"/>ships unnecessarily) the issue, if in
                        fact it is raised by the Afghans, may be quickly squelched.</p>
                    <p>12. Conclusions: <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s first visit
                        abroad as the leader of a revolutionary Afghan regime could produce results
                        which would have far-reaching impact on this government’s ultimate survival
                        and ability to deliver on many of its reforms and promises. The trip
                        undoubtedly will be utilized to symbolize the new “special relationship”
                        between the two countries, a relationship which has already gone well beyond
                        the close ties developed under previous Afghan regimes. How far the Soviet
                        leadership will go in meeting the genuine needs of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his colleagues remains to be
                        seen, but we anticipate that Moscow will probably choose to err on the
                        generous side, since this regime, and the type of revolution it represents,
                        serves a number of Moscow’s ideological and security interests.</p>

                            Afghanistan’s problems and its status as a Soviet pawn would be
                            “counterproductive” because it contradicted another part of the paper

                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. Karim also asked if
                            the United States would consider receiving former Afghan General Abdul
                            Wali. <persName corresp="#p_HP_1">Henze</persName> described the
                            political situation in Afghanistan as “very fluid” and urged that
                            maintaining contact with groups opposed to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government was in the interest
                            of the United States. On the question of how the United States might
                            assist such opposition, <persName corresp="#p_HP_1">Henze</persName>
                            noted both difficulties and opportunities: “Without some adjustments in

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                        <p>On 27 April 1978 leftist military forces staged a successful coup in
                            Afghanistan, replacing the government of President <persName corresp="#p_DKM_1">Daoud</persName> with a Soviet-oriented
                            “Democratic Republic”. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and other government leaders all are members of
                            the “People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan”, which is Soviet-style
                            communist party in a Stalinist mode. The new regime has placed a high
                            priority on consolidating its control of government organizations and
                            the armed forces, and has had considerable success in this. It has been
                            greatly aided by an influx of Soviet advisors who have been placed in
                            almost all departments of the government and throughout the armed
                            forces. The situation in the countryside is different. Afghan
                            governments traditionally have had little control in the rural, tribal
                            areas; this government is no exception. Its problems stem particularly
                            from its pro-Soviet, communist orientation, which offends many deeply
                            religious, conservative Afghans. Afghans tend to be nationalistic, and
                            many are conscious of, and resent, the growing dominance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in their affairs.</p>
                        <p>A tribal rebellion has been underway for several months in Afghanistan’s
                            eastern provinces, and the government is finding it increasingly
                            difficult to maintain public order in other outlying areas of the
                            country. Outside Afghanistan, emigre dissidents claim to have several
                            thousand trained fighters, including a few hundred former military
                            officers, in and around Peshawar and the Pakistan frontier. The
                            principal Afghan rebel group in this area is the Afghan National
                            Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>), although
                            there also are other significant groups which rival the <gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>. Thus far the Government of Pakistan
                                (<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>) has turned a blind eye to
                            this Afghan dissident activity. The rebels are reported to be receiving
                            support from individual Afghans living abroad, and also from Saudi
                            Arabian sources (The latter is not confirmed nor whether the alleged
                            support comes from private or official sources.).</p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="0133" xml:id="pg_88"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assumption:</p>
                        <p>Afghanistan’s importance lies in the destabilizing effect its communist
                            government could have on the region—particularly on Pakistan. Further
                            afield, the Afghan situation is having an adverse psychological impact
                            on many Third World countries. It tends to bolster the thesis that the
                            Soviet way is the wave of the future, and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will make no effort to stem Soviet
                            encroachments in the Middle East. Therefore, it is in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest to have the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> Government fall and be replaced
                            by a non-communist regime. Currently the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is seeking to influence Afghan policies by conventional
                            diplomatic means, including the continuation of AID programs. Our
                            ability to exercise economic and political leverage is limited, and
                            efforts to date have been largely successful. Conversely, given its
                            geographic proximity, existing close economic and military
                            relationships, and common political philosophy, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has been able to move quickly to
                            consolidate and strengthen its already considerable influence.<note n="7" xml:id="d34fn7"><persName corresp="#p_HP_1">Henze</persName>
                                drew a line from the word “close” and wrote in the top margin:
                                “unsuccessful!”</note> Nevertheless, an anti-communist coup d’etat
                            is still possible, and the Soviets would probably feel obliged to accept
                            such an event without resorting to military intervention, assuming it
                            was carried out quickly and decisively. On the other hand, a gradually
                            accelerated insurgency would carry a greater risk of countermeasures,
                            both overt and covert.</p>
                        <p>Our intelligence indicates the insurgency is going to continue, no matter
                            what position the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> adopts in respect
                            to it. We cannot at this time predict how it will develop, nor whether
                            it will succeed. But we do see it hurting the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> Government and, in particular,
                            having a divisive impact on the armed forces. The soldiers, mainly rural
                            draftees, are being required to use their weapons against their fellows
                            from the countryside. The officer corps, although purged of suspected
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> elements, could
                            well become increasingly embarrassed and angry at being obliged to
                            impose an unpopular regime on their own people. A possible scenario: the
                            continuing insurgency would lead eventually to the active disaffection
                            of a sufficient number of officers into blaming the country’s problems
                            on <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, who would forcefully
                            overthrow his regime. Finally, there is the fatigue factor. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> Government is
                            narrowly based and thinly staffed. A sustained insurgency would
                            undoubtedly drain scarce managerial and leadership resources the
                            government can ill afford. While it is possible that the government will
                            fall very quickly (viz, in a lightning coup), it seems more likely that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> will be overthrown as
                            a result of his continuing inability to deal with the insurgency. We
                            also believe that the Afghan <pb n="89" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_89"/>rebels will need some outside assistance if they are to sustain the
                            insurgency at its present level. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could increase the prospects of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime being overthrown through
                            a variety of covert action techniques, ranging from propaganda support
                            to clandestine arms supply. The risks to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be largely dependent upon the type of techniques
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Covert Action Options:</p>
                        <p>(1) Generate a worldwide media campaign publicizing the regime’s
                            problems, exposing <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and
                            his colleagues as pawns of the Soviet Union. Condemn <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> for attempting to force an
                            atheistic philosophy on a sincerely religious population, and for
                            violating their basic human rights. Such a campaign would be virtually
                            risk free, but probably would have little impact within Afghanistan
                            itself. It would, however, establish the groundwork for additional
                                <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> proposals, including influencing
                            Saudi Arabian and other prospective donors of aid to the rebel
                            cause.</p>
                        <p>(2) Expand the above program to include radio broadcasts in Dari beamed
                            into Afghanistan from neighboring countries. This would almost certainly
                            require the cooperation of the Governments of Pakistan and/or Iran,
                            either of which might be difficult to secure. In the past the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has beamed propaganda into Afghanistan
                            from a radio station in Quetta. If relations between the two countries
                            deteriorate, the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> might resume such
                            broadcasts. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            shortwave broadcasts also reach Afghanistan, and we could explore the
                            possibility of putting our message on this medium.</p>
                        <p>(3) Encourage and assist Afghan rebel groups with representation outside
                            of Afghanistan to oppose the regime. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> officers currently are in contact with a small number
                            of Afghan exiles who at this time are being exploited only for
                            intelligence collection purposes. Other potential exile leaders have
                            been identified and could be approached in due course. One of these is
                            an Afghan, long resident in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>,
                            who already is believed by emigre leaders to have some form of secret
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support. Some of these
                            individuals could be used as conduits of funds and material support to
                            rebel groups operating from the Peshawar area. We also might establish
                            connections with a member of the ruling family of Chitral, the Pakistan
                            princely state which lies just across the border from Nuristan where
                            most of the guerrilla activity is taking place. This could give us the
                            possibility of utilizing the natural smuggling routes through Chitral to
                            support the rebels directly, thus bypassing the emigres. Saudi Arabians,
                            who may have some connections with the dissidents, might be asked to
                            front for us in supporting the insurgency. Any proposed material
                            assistance to dissidents would have to be carefully weighed from the
                            policy standpoint. Aside from <pb n="90" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_90"/>spending funds for intelligence collection, and supplying material aid
                            on humanitarian grounds (viz, medical supplies), selection of this
                            covert action option would indicate a clear-cut <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government decision to attempt to overturn the current
                            Afghan Government.</p>

                            attention. It might be blamed on the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, or <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> in particular,
                            although it would technically remain nonattributable. However, in view
                            of the current volume of Soviet propaganda against the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, particularly with regard to
                            neighboring Iran, we doubt that Soviet reaction to such a program would
                            adversely affect <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests in the
                            area. It would increase the hostility of the government towards
                            Americans in Afghanistan, but this is not a vital consideration. A
                            successful propaganda program would make the world more aware of the
                            nature of the Afghan regime, but it probably would do little to weaken
                            it. On the contrary, it might induce the government to tighten its grip
                            and become even more dependent upon the Soviets. Propaganda of the type
                            envisioned could provide marginal encouragement to the insurgents, but
                            overall would have little effect on them.</p>
                        <p>Although thus far we have refrained from doing so, we have the capability
                            to explore with Afghan exiles the possibility of joint action against
                            the regime. If, however, there is no intention to follow through, it
                            would be inadvisable to embark on such a course of action. Raising the
                            expectation of these exiles and then refraining from taking any action,
                            would do more harm than good.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> support, or at least quiet
                            acquiescence, would be almost essential for the success of any program
                            designed to assist the Peshawar-based rebels. Although we could smuggle
                            small quantities of material to them unilaterally, tacit <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> agreement would be required if larger
                            quantities are involved. We have one unconfirmed report that Saudi
                            sources are sending equipment to the rebels via Karachi, and that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has turned a blind eye to this.
                            If true, this suggests that should we become involved in a supply
                            program, we might consider working with the Saudis in view of the
                            influence they can bring to bear on the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There are several competing factions among the rebels. Some are royalist,
                            some are Islamic fundamentalist and some are both. If we elect to
                            support the dissidence, considerable care will be needed to ensure that
                            our aid gets to the proper place; that it is not squandered on political
                            infighting. We believe this is a manageable problem, because we should
                            be able to keep fairly close track of activity in the dissident movement
                            through a number of separate, compartmented sources.</p>

                        Bill’s memo. (S)<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3"><persName corresp="#p_GWE_1">Griffith</persName>’s memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, January 31, was entitled “The Arc of
                            Instability: What is to be Done?” The “arc” referred to three crisis
                            points which created a geographic arc: Yemen, Iran, and Afghanistan.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWE_1">Griffith</persName> identified the
                            policy problem as two-pronged: 1) instability in this arc threatened
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> access to petroleum sources in
                            the Arabian Peninsula; and 2) regional allies would have diminished
                            expectations about what the United States could do to restore stability.
                            With regard to Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GWE_1">Griffith</persName> counseled that the United States should engage
                            in consultations with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (and to a lesser extent,
                            India) [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] and that the
                            United States should endorse arming rebels in Afghanistan and, if
                            necessary, increase arms shipments to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan toward
                            that endorsement. (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Staff

                        Memo</p>
                    <p>I agree with most of what Bill says. His analysis is correct except for the
                        claim that the Pakistanis are supporting the Afghan rebels. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> says that they have no information to
                        confirm this. I would not exclude the possibility (and certainly the Paks
                        are keeping a weather eye on the situation) but just because some of the
                        dissidents claim they have support is not evidence that they actually have
                        it. (S)</p>
                    <p>As far as the recommendations go, I have some reservations about how active
                        we should be in supporting the insurgents (see below) but am otherwise on
                        board with the caveat that we should not get into an extensive arms supply
                        relationship with the Pakistanis because of Indian considerations. And,
                        there is of course the general question as to how we supplement what we do
                        in terms of meeting short term Saudi and Pakistani problems (arms supply)
                        with other measures that go to the issue of their potential instability. In
                        the Pakistani case, this is first of all promoting a modus vivendi with
                        India and secondly economic assistance. (S)</p>

                        in Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>The discussion with <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was inconclusive but raised
                        important questions. The current insurgency (and even any likely extension
                        of it) will not directly threaten the Kabul regime. The Khalq represents, to
                        be sure, only one ethnic element in Afghanistan, but it is by far the most
                        significant. If, however, there is enough blood-letting, it is conceivable
                        that the Army could tire of taking the losses and move to oust the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime. However, the Khalq has
                        moved quickly to get political control over the Army. It is not sure that
                        the Army even now has the capability of mounting a counter coup and whatever
                        ability they have will be steadily eroded as the Army is further
                        politicized. (S)</p>
                    <p>Another argument for supporting the insurgency is that it will keep the
                        Afghans preoccupied on their side of the border and hence less able to stir
                        up trouble on the Pakistani side. A further argument is this: as the regime
                        gets more embroiled, it will turn more to the Soviets for help. Some argue
                        that this is against our interests since we would like to see the Afghans be
                        more independent of the Soviets. If you believe as I do, however, that this
                        is a vain hope, then there might be some advantage in getting the Soviets
                        deeply involved. As long as our hand was not evident, this would work to our
                        favor by scaring the Indians, Iraqis, etc. (S)</p>
                    <p>Lastly, there is a humanitarian issue. Would we be stimulating a lot of
                        killing to no good end? Pathans are said to think that getting killed while
                        fighting the central government is not all that bad, especially if the
                        central government is godless.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">Pathan is another
                            word for Pashtun, the major ethnic group of Afghanistan.</note> I have
                        never been able to determine the views of a Pathan who had been killed as to
                        whether he thought it was worthwhile; that would, I guess, depend on whether
                        the Koran makes good on all of its promises. It bothers me, however,
                        especially if there is no significant gain made. (S)</p>
                    <p>The issue is, then, whether much will be gained. Most of those present
                        thought that the answer would be no. There will be a lot of fighting, the
                        government will be distracted, the Soviets will get more involved, but
                        overall the odds are against it having much effect on the strategic outcome.
                        If that is the case, and given the problems we might have “consulting” with
                        Congress on this, the consensus was to keep hands off. (S)</p>
                    <p>What we should do, however, is make sure that we keep channels open to the
                        insurgents and keep the matter under review. Also, there is no need for us
                        to discourage the Pakistanis or the Saudis from keeping their hand in to the
                        extent they see desirable. On that there was general agreement. (S)</p>

                        Ambassador’s chauffeur, Gul Mohammad, that the Ambassador had been kidnapped
                        by armed persons, one of whom was wearing a uniform. When the Ambassador’s
                        car had approached the traffic intersection near <gloss target="#t_USICA_1">USICA</gloss>, a man who appeared to be a uniformed traffic policeman
                        halted the car. He pointed a pistol at the driver and ordered him to open
                        the car’s electric door locks. Four armed men then entered the Ambassador’s
                        vehicle and ordered the driver to drive to the Kabul Hotel. They entered the
                        hotel with the Ambassador as a prisoner after ordering the driver to return
                        to the Embassy and inform the Embassy about what had happened.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> immediately phoned Foreign
                        Ministry Chief of Protocol and the <gloss target="#t_RSO_1">RSO</gloss>
                        telephoned police commandant <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Sayed Daoud
                            Taroon</persName> for information and assistance. Both Mandozai and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> appeared surprised, and
                        this appeared to be the first word they had received of <pb n="94" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_94"/>the incident. <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> insisted that the Ambassador’s driver repeat the
                        story to him over the telephone. (At this time, it was not yet clear to the
                        Embassy whether the Ambassador had been taken by Afghan officials or someone
                        else.) Mandozai called back almost immediately and informed <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> that he had informed Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, that this was not the work
                        of the government, and that they were in touch with the police.</p>
                    <p>5. Events at the hotel: Some EmbOffs immediately went to the Kabul Hotel,
                        arriving at approximately 0900. At the same time, the first police arrived,
                        pushing through the people in the lobby toward a small room off the hotel
                        desk. The EmbOffs heard loud scuffling and angry noises in the room.</p>
                    <p>6. At about 0915 Political Counselor Flatin established contact with a
                        plainclothes police officer, who appeared to be in charge of the operation.
                        He was a former Air Force officer known by Americans to be one of <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s closest aides. We do not know his
                        name.</p>
                    <p>7. At about 0920, the first Soviet police advisor, a tall, balding man, with
                        a black overcoat, arrived on the scene and immediately went into
                        consultations with the Afghan officials.</p>
                    <p>8. At about 0930, at the request of the American side at the hotel, there was
                        a small conference among the Americans, the Afghan police, and the Soviet
                        advisor. All then available information about the incident was exchanged at
                        that time. We were told that the kidnappers had refused to answer the room
                        telephone and were refusing to respond to any attempts to communicate with
                        them. The American officers stressed their concern for the safety of the
                        Ambassador, and were assured by the Afghan and Soviet participants that they
                        shared this concern. Following this meeting the American officers began to
                        find it more difficult to deal directly with the Soviet advisors and
                        therefore began to negotiate directly with the senior Afghan police
                        officials at the scene.</p>
                    <p>9. At 0950, under the instructions of <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName>, Political Counselor Flatin
                        repeated the strong concern of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> for
                        the safety of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> to both
                        the Afghan police and Soviet advisors (at this time another two Soviet
                        plainclothesmen had arrived on the scene, carrying with them several green
                        canvas bags) and requested that no precipitous action be launched. They were
                        told that in the American view this would greatly endanger the Ambassador.
                        The Americans requested that the Afghans wait for the advice which the
                        Embassy had already requested from Washington. The Afghans and Soviets
                        clearly acknowledged and understood this <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> request and indicated that they agreed with the wisdom of
                        following a patient course of action, but they declined to make any
                        commitments. About this time, the Embassy’s ambulance and medical staff
                        arrived at the hotel and were permitted to position themselves in the
                        lobby.</p>
                    <p><pb n="95" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_95"/>10. At about 1015 Sergei Bakhturin,
                        the Soviet Embassy security officer, arrived on the scene. He assured the
                        Americans of a strong Soviet interest in the Ambassador’s safety.<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">In telegram 3716 from Moscow, February 14, the Embassy

                            share responsibility with the Afghans in precipitating the assault on

                            during the incident: 1) “failure to adequately inform official Americans
                            on the scene of the terrorist terms (conditions and deadline) and about
                            the Afghan plans to assault the room where <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> was being held;” and 2) “disregard of repeated

                            restraint.” (Ibid.) In telegram 38921 to Kabul, February 15, the

                            death,” and that “this incident may well cause serious damage to our

                            15, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> emphasized that
                            “every effort” was made by Afghan security authorities to save <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>’s life. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D790073–0061)</note> At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s aide also assured us that all possible precautions
                        were being taken to prevent any harm from coming to the Ambassador, and he
                        promised that he would personally defend the Ambassador with his own life.
                        It was at this time that we gained additional details about the entry into
                        the hotel. The Afghan police said that the kidnappers had moved Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> through a crowded lobby and
                        up the stairs to the second floor (second top) to room 117. One of the three
                        kidnappers had returned to the lobby to ask the desk for the key to the
                        room. Not recognizing him as a hotel guest, the hotel people were suspicious
                        and sent a hotel employee up to the room with him. At the door to the room,
                        he ordered the employee at gunpoint to unlock the door. The other kidnappers
                        entered the room with the Ambassador and the third returned downstairs with
                        the employee and at gunpoint ordered the hotel desk personnel not to allow
                        anyone to go upstairs or to enter the hotel. It is not clear to us how he
                        subsequently was overcome. From the nature of the 0900 police rush on the
                        office near the desk where the terrorist presumably was, it is possible that
                        he was disarmed and subdued at that time.</p>
                    <p>11. At 1115 a Ministry of Interior official asked <gloss target="#t_RSO_1">RSO</gloss> Boles if we had a security plan for this type of situation.
                        Boles replied that to this point we had left the situation in charge of the
                        Afghan police and the Soviet advisors, but that we felt that taking
                        precipitous action would <pb n="96" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_96"/>greatly
                        endanger the Ambassador’s life. Boles then outlined the American strategy of
                        waiting in such cases. Boles then told the police that we had our medical
                        staff ready for all emergencies and were prepared to move the Ambassador to
                        the dispensary, if necessary. Boles was then assured that the police would
                        provide an escort.</p>
                    <p>12. At about 1115 a.m. Mr. James E. Taylor, Political Officer, and Embassy
                        employee, Jalal Talibee, arrived at the Ministry of Interior. They asked to
                        see police commandant <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Sayed Daoud
                            Taroon</persName> and were asked to wait in <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s outer office by his secretary, for a few minutes.
                        Earlier in the morning, <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> has
                        met Admin Officer Bernie Woertz and a local and had said that an American
                        officer was welcome to sit in <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s office and act as a contact point for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. What Woertz and his local picked up by
                        way of info was transmitted by <gloss target="#t_sitrep_1">sitrep</gloss>
                        no. 5.</p>
                    <p>13. At 1120, Afghan police were observed moving ladders against the outside
                        of the hotel in such a way that the kidnappers could see the action. Troops
                        with what appeared to be commando badges also arrived at that time. By this
                        time, the entire hotel and neighboring streets and buildings were filled
                        with police and other security forces. At 1125, <gloss target="#t_RSO_1">RSO</gloss> Boles notified the Embassy that it appeared that a police
                        action against room 117 may be pending immediately. At the Embassy’s
                        request, American officers at the hotel once again asked the Afghan police
                        for patience, advising that time is usually on the side of the authorities.
                        The Americans then saw several commandos enter the hotel lobby, cock their
                        weapons, and rush upstairs.</p>
                    <p>14. At 1128, the Embassy told American officers at the hotel that <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> was trying to get in touch
                        with police commandant <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>. This
                        information was passed to the Afghan police at the hotel and they were asked
                        not to do anything drastic until these negotiations took place.</p>
                    <p>15. At 1130 Bakhturin told American officers that the men in the room
                        demanded the return of the man whom the police had caught in the lobby. He
                        said that this request had been conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>. The terrorists said that after their
                        comrade had been returned to them, they would be willing to talk further
                        with the police. An Afghan police official told us that security forces had
                        talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>, but did
                        not know what his condition was. He reportedly confirmed in English that he
                        was all right. They also reported that a policeman across the street had
                        viewed him through a window and he appeared to be all right. Bakhturin
                        indicated that he thought it would be at least an hour before anything could
                        be done.</p>
                    <p>16. Also around 1130, Bakhturin asked Flatin what languages the Ambassador
                        knew besides English. He was told the Ambassador’s best foreign language was
                        Russian. Bakhturin did not appear satisfied with this, and asked what other
                        languages he knew. When told German, Bakhturin asked if Flatin knew German,
                        and was told yes.</p>
                    <p><pb n="97" facs="0142" xml:id="pg_97"/>17. At 1140, a police security officer
                        asked Flatin to accompany him upstairs. On the second floor, Flatin met
                        Azizi, a plainclothes police official that he had by chance once met in
                        Badghis Province in 1977. (This police official, who speaks perfect English,
                        had at that time told Flatin that he served one and a half years as a
                        special police bodyguard for Ambassador Newmann when he was under a PLO
                        terrorist threat in Kabul in the 1960s. He gave the impression of being a
                        secret police official at that time.) Azizi, who also spoke apparently
                        perfect Russian with the Soviet advisors, asked Flatin if he could do a
                        favor for the police. He asked whether he would mind talking to the
                        Ambassador in German so that the kidnappers would not understand. The police
                        seemed to think that the kidnappers knew English.) Flatin asked whether this
                        would endanger the Ambassador in any way, and was assured that the police
                        had already made arrangements with the terrorists. (They were talking with
                        the terrorist named “Najib” through the keyhole.)</p>
                    <p>18. The police asked Flatin to ask the Ambassador what type of weapons the
                        terrorists had. Speaking through the door, Flatin identified himself in
                        German and asked the Ambassador how he was. The Ambassador replied that he
                        was all right. His voice sounded strained, but strong. Flatin, upon the
                        repeated requests of the police, then asked the Ambassador what types of
                        weapons his kidnappers had. The Ambassador began to reply, but after saying
                        the word “revolvers”, he was silenced by the people in the room, who by that
                        time were probably aware that a language other than one they understood was
                        being used. The police requested the captors to permit the conversation to
                        continue, explaining that the Ambassador should be permitted to speak to his
                        own Embassy officials. The kidnappers retort was, “We are in charge here and
                        it isn’t necessary.”</p>
                    <p>19. Flatin was then asked to tell the Ambassador that ten minutes from that
                        moment he was to try to go to the bathroom or drop to the floor. Flatin
                        requested an immediate conference elsewhere with the police. Flatin
                        commented that such an instruction to the Ambassador obviously meant that
                        the police were poised to strike, and, as the police already knew, the
                        Americans had officially requested a delay. Flatin explained that <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> was trying to discuss the
                        situation at the very moment with police commandant <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>, and requested that nothing be done
                        until the American Embassy had had a chance to discuss onward tactics
                        further with the police. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> talked again twice with Deputy Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM_1">Dost</persName>, and attempted desperately
                        to reach Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> by
                        phone (and dispatched Woertz to try to enter Palace.)</p>
                    <p>20. The Afghan police officer, who at this stage had apparently taken over
                        charge of the operation, a youthful and tough-looking plain-<pb n="98" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_98"/>clothes man, became very upset over this
                        request for a delay, and insisted that he was under orders to strike
                        immediately. Flatin then talked with Bakhturin who had in the meantime come
                        upstairs, and stressed our strong American interest in the delay. Bakhturin
                        said that he agreed time was also a good idea. He then talked with the
                        senior Soviet police advisor. The situation then became temporarily calm on
                        the second floor. It was at this point that Bakhturin revealed that the
                        Afghan police were working under time deadlines which had been imposed by
                        the kidnappers. The original noontime deadline had already passed, and the
                        police now thought they had an extension until 1300.</p>
                    <p>21. About this time, firemen with picks and axes arrived on the scene and
                        joined the police. Then at this time, a photograph of the Ambassador was
                        displayed to all members of the security strike forces. One of the commandos
                        then asked, “Is that the terrorist?” He was told that it was the Ambassador
                        whom he was to avoid shooting.</p>
                    <p>22. Events at the Interior Ministry: At 1145, at the Interior Ministry, Mr.
                        Taylor again asked the secretary to remind commandant <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> that he was waiting to see him. Mr.
                        Taylor told the secretary, a police captain, that it was important that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy representative see
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> in order to know what the
                        Afghan Government was intending to do. The secretary came from <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s office and Mr. Taylor was told to
                        continue waiting.</p>
                    <p>23. For some reason the strike plans were apparently again relaxed and the
                        American officers were able to again consult the Embassy. At an earlier
                        stage in the morning’s operation the Americans had recommended that the
                        police bring the third terrorist, as demanded, to his colleagues in order to
                        elicit further demands from them. The police decided to bring the third man
                        up to the room but this gesture was not sufficient; the terrorists wanted
                        the return of his weapon too.</p>
                    <p>24. At 1207 the Afghan police requested that the American medical personnel
                        and stretcher be brought upstairs and placed in readiness near the corridor
                        of room 117.</p>
                    <p>25. Immediately thereafter the third terrorist was brought up the stairs
                        hooded. It was clear to <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOffs</gloss> that a
                        strike was being prepared. The Embassy was informed and again <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> urgently requested that <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOffs</gloss> seek further delays. The <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOffs</gloss> repeated their earlier advice to
                        the Embassy that nothing could evidently be done with the police officials
                        at the scene, as they were repeatedly arguing that they were already under
                        orders from high officials elsewhere. At one time the Americans were told
                        they were under orders of the “Prime Minister” himself. This was in response
                        to the Embassy officer’s statement that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> was still trying to reach Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>26. At this stage, the Soviet Embassy security officer and three Soviet
                        police advisors were all present, but hanging back, trying to <pb n="99" facs="0144" xml:id="pg_99"/>look only like “advisors”, and allowing the
                        Afghan police to be in charge. Flatin talked to the man who appeared to be a
                        senior Soviet advisor and asked whether he spoke English. He did not, but he
                        did speak a little German. Flatin tried to secure his understanding of the
                        urgent need for a delay. He replied this was an Afghan police matter.</p>
                    <p>27. At about 1215 p.m. Mr. Taylor called the Embassy to inform that he still
                        had not been allowed to see <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>
                        despite several reminders to <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>
                        that he was waiting and that it was extremely important to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to know what the Afghan Government was
                        intending to do.</p>
                    <p>28. Back at the hotel: At 1217 additional security forces rushed upstairs and
                        took ready positions near room 117.</p>
                    <p>29. At approximately 1230 a military officer in the lobby who seemed to be in
                        charge of the operation gave instructions to <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s assistant who returned upstairs. At 1235 <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s aide came downstairs again and
                        went into the room with the officer-in-charge who seemed to be talking on
                        the radio.</p>
                    <p>30. At 1230 p.m. still not having been allowed to see <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>, Mr. Taylor again called the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> to ask if he should remain in <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s waiting room. The <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> advised Mr. Taylor to wait at the Ministry
                        for 30 more minutes but that Mr. Taylor was to insist that the following
                        message be passed to <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>: “Above
                        all else, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not want any action
                        taken by the Afghan Government which would endanger the welfare of
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>.” That message was
                        given to <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s secretary, who
                        claimed that he had passed it to <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>31. Events again at the hotel: At the hotel, at 1237, <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s aide went outside the hotel but
                        returned one minute later. The officer-in-charge returned to the side room
                        where there was a radio, after which two plainclothes gunmen went
                        upstairs.</p>
                    <p>32. At about 1245 p.m. Mr. Taylor called the Embassy from the Interior
                        Ministry, again saying that, in spite of repeated requests, he had still not
                        been allowed to see <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>, and was
                        advised by the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> that the foregoing
                        message should be stressed again and that the Embassy had information that
                        the Afghan authorities were contemplating action within the next two
                        minutes. Mr. Taylor reiterated the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        position to <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s secretary and
                        stressed that that policy had been specifically by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. Mr. Taylor also emphasized that
                        information available to the Embassy indicated that some kind of forceful
                        action was imminent and that absolutely nothing should be done that would
                        endanger the welfare of the Ambassador. The secretary entered <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s office and upon emerging at 1250
                        said the message had been given to the police commandant. The secretary
                        added that “not all information should be made available, everything is
                        under control, and <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> is busy
                        with the operation at the hotel.” He claimed <pb n="100" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_100"/>that “all is designed” to “secure the life of the
                        Ambassador and the terrorists.”</p>
                    <p>33. At about 1245 it was clear to EmbOffs in the corridor outside room 117
                        that the police had received their orders. Top police officials and other
                        armed men joined the crowd outside the room. One specially armed and armored
                        policeman lay prone on the floor before the door, pointing his weapon at the
                        door, while others stood behind him and to his side also pointing their
                        weapons at the door. The Soviet advisors then stepped forward into operation
                        roles. One Soviet advisor helped to arm an Afghan policeman with what
                        appeared to be special weaponry. Two other Soviet police advisors and
                        Bakhturin went out to the balcony. The tall, senior Soviet advisor then made
                        hand signals from the balcony, presumably positioning the snipers across the
                        street.</p>
                    <p>34. Before 1250, the police had all non-participants take positions of
                        safety. At exactly 1250 very heavy gunfire broke out in the corridor, in the
                        room, and from across the street. Both single-shot and automatic weapons
                        were heard (several American officers were nearby). The main bursts of
                        firing continued for approximately 40 seconds. The police snipers across the
                        street continued to fire until two Soviet advisors gave hand signals to cut
                        it off. Following that, there were at least three more bursts from inside
                        the room, and then silence.</p>
                    <p>35. The police then asked the Americans to come immediately with the
                        stretcher. The entryway into the hotel room was a seven foot long hall whose
                        air was filled with dense cordite smoke. When the American party entered the
                        room, they found the Ambassador seated to the right side of the entryway
                        next to a wardrobe. His head was slumped to the right side and he had
                        sustained several bullet wounds, one of which appeared to be a single small
                        calibre shot above the right eye. A heavy calibre round had struck him in
                        the heart area. A third round had hit him in the left wrist. The American
                        party placed the Ambassador on the stretcher. The Embassy doctor’s initial
                        diagnosis in the room was that the Ambassador was dead.</p>
                    <p>36. At 1253 the party rushed the Ambassador down to a waiting American
                        ambulance which took the Ambassador’s body to the American dispensary. Mr.
                        Flatin remained behind as the two terrorists were removed. The first
                        terrorist was dragged out into the hallway through cascades of water (the
                        radiator pipes in the room had been shot out). The police slapped his head
                        around with a gun butt, but he appeared as probably dead. The second man was
                        still, and possibly dead. The third terrorist, who had been held back in the
                        immediate area of shooting was then badly roughed up by the police. A hood
                        was put back on his head and he was dragged down to the lobby. By about 1258
                        all three terrorists had been removed from the hotel. The one who had been
                        first captured was definitely alive at that time and on his feet. A <pb n="101" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_101"/>second terrorist was taken from the
                        hotel either unconscious or dead. The third terrorist was on a stretcher
                        very bloody and apparently dead.</p>
                    <p>37. Police officers then came out of the room with the Ambassador’s sports
                        coat and tie. Flatin asked for possession. The nearest police official was
                        prepared to permit this but the tall Soviet police advisor came up and
                        convinced him to rescind his permission, explaining the items were necessary
                        for police examination. (The Ambassador’s possessions were later returned to
                        the Embassy.)</p>
                    <p>38. Events back at the Interior Ministry: At about 1255, Mr. Taylor phoned
                        the Embassy to report that the Afghan police were obviously on the verge of
                        some overt action. Mr. Taylor talked to Mr. Turco who said that whatever the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> was planning had just happened. At
                        that point, while Mr. Taylor was on the phone with Mr. Turco a Russian
                        civilian emerged from <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s
                        office and left the waiting room. This man had not entered through the
                        waiting room while Taylor was there so he must have been with <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> during the entire period Taylor was
                        at the Ministry. About three minutes later, another official entered the
                        waiting room and said to the secretary that he had heard shooting and the
                        secretary informed all of the police stations to search their areas for the
                        source of the shooting.</p>
                    <p>39. At about 1305 hours <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> and
                        his bodyguard came out of the commandant’s office and <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> said that it was all over “and that
                        the Ambassador was injured and in the hospital.” <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> quickly left the room and went down
                        to the main exit of the building. Mr. Taylor rushed after him down the step
                        and asked for five seconds of his time to explain what Mr. Taylor thought of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s behavior and his
                        handling of the whole affair. <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>
                        replied he was “too busy” and didn’t have time to talk with Mr. Taylor.</p>
                    <p>40. <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> with his machine gun drove
                        off in his Mercedes. It was obvious that <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> refused to have any American representative aware of
                        what the Afghan police were preparing to do. He also deliberately
                        disregarded the American position for delay which was repeatedly made known
                        to him a number of times, and disregarded his telephone promise to the
                            <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> not to take action without
                        consulting us, and that after the incident he did not want to hear any
                        questions or statements from the American representative. It was equally
                        clear that a civilian Soviet advisor was intimately involved with the Afghan
                        police preparations in <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>’s
                        office.</p>
                    <p>41. Back at the hotel, Flatin subsequently discussed the incident with the
                        police plainclothesman in charge of the operation, and asked why the action
                        had been launched so precipitously. The police official said he was under
                        higher orders and claimed that the Afghan police did not start the shooting.
                        He explained that the terrorists had told the police that the ultimatum time
                        had elapsed and that they did not want <pb n="102" facs="0147" xml:id="pg_102"/>to wait any further. The police then pleaded for a
                        further delay, but upon hearing a shot within the room, opened fire and
                        rushed the room in an attempt to save the Ambassador. When told that the
                        American Ambassador was dead the police officer expressed his sympathy.</p>
                    <p>42. Some American officers then went back to room 117. They looked for signs
                        of shooting in the room. No bullet holes were observed in the corridor door
                        to the room, which looked as though it had been struck near its lock by a
                        heavy object. The glass door at the end of the hallway leading directly into
                        the room was shattered. The wall against which the Ambassador’s body was
                        found had at least five bullet holes at an elevation of approximately five
                        feet higher and on the wall opposite the window were a number of bullet
                        holes above the door frame, presumably from the snipers across the street.
                        No bullet holes were observed in that part of the wall immediately behind
                        the Ambassador’s body’s location or in the wardrobe cabinet next to this
                        spot. The police then asked Embassy officers to leave before they could
                        finish their inspection of the room.</p>

                    <p>The state of our knowledge of Afghanistan and of Afghan groups abroad opposed
                        to the present regime is so fragmentary that it is impossible to develop “a
                        coherent and systematic plan.” Remedying this deficiency must be the first
                        step. Beyond this, we need a more coherent framework within which to plan.
                        Covert action only makes sense within the framework of a broader set of
                        policy goals toward which covert action contributes. I am not sure we have
                        these in respect to Afghanistan. Do we simply want to harass the present
                        regime and prevent its consolidation? Do we want to replace it with
                        something else? What? What kind of resources in what amounts are we willing
                        to commit to supporting a regime more to our liking? Dissidents with whom we
                        would have to work to do anything about Afghanistan will want to know this.
                        So will the Pakistanis or anybody else we might want to work through.

                    <p>Recent statements of the President and the Vice President leave me with the
                        impression that they are unwilling to support serious intervention in

                            to bring about a change in government in power in Kabul.” <persName corresp="#p_IKF_1">Inderfurth</persName> noted the paper’s
                            “principal deficiency” was that “it gives only a vague impression of

                    <p>Attached is a paper outlining Covert Action (<gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss>) options in Afghanistan. It is circulated in order to obtain
                        your views for the forthcoming Special Coordination Committee (<gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>) meeting regarding the appropriateness of
                        the options described. It is our present intention to draft a formal <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> proposal for <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> consideration and a Presidential Finding based on your
                        reactions.</p>
                    <p>However, if our <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> program is to include
                        support to a possible insurgency, the acquisition of additional operational
                        intelligence on the various rebel groups will be necessary before a proposal
                        can be submitted.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if the decision is made simply to publicize the Soviet
                        role in Afghanistan through our international network of media assets,
                        agents of influence and liaison contacts, the General Finding authorizing us
                        to “expose and counter Soviet interference in other countries’ affairs”
                        already provides us with policy sufficiency.</p>
                    <p>The options presented vary in degree of risk and cost, but are not mutually
                        exclusive. For example, a program of support to an insurgency would also
                        include some or all of the less risky options, such as a worldwide
                        propaganda campaign on both Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and the abuses
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime.</p>

                        <p>The communist regime of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Nur Mohammad

                                Station in Kabul.</note> It possesses the essential mechanisms of
                            central government and, if left to its own devices, should eventually be
                            able to lay to rest the tribal insurrections it continues to face,
                            principally in the eastern border area of Nuristan. No central Afghan
                            government has ever been in total, absolute control of all parts of the
                            country, and the center traditionally faces periodic tests of its
                            authority from parochial interests in the more remote provincial areas.
                            In this respect the Nuristan insurrection follows a familiar pattern,
                            but it is taking place on an order of magnitude considerably in excess
                            of what recent Afghan regimes have faced, and with a professed
                            ideological content not usual to such events.</p>
                        <p>The Afghan army, its leadership already debilitated by arrests and
                            purges, is disadvantaged in Nuristan by terrain which singularly favors
                            guerrilla activity. The admittedly limited intelligence available on the
                            insurrection suggests that regular forces have not fared well and that
                            word-of-mouth awareness of Nuristani success may be stimulating
                            recalcitrant tribal elements in other areas to assume equally
                            belligerent postures towards Kabul’s control. The latter point is
                            largely speculative however; little reliable intelligence now exists. To
                            the extent that current army leadership is embarrassed by its
                            performance in this matter, turning on the political leadership which
                            ordered the confrontation, is one possible course open to it. While
                            tribal insurrection cannot directly bring down the central government,
                            its continued success could spur politically uncommitted army officers
                            to such an effort. The insurrectionists are poorly armed and lack money,
                            medical facilities and ammunition; nor do they now appear to be
                            receiving more than token assistance from external sources. Left to its
                            own devices, the insurrection <pb n="107" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_107"/>will probably peter out. Actively stimulated, it conceivably could
                            spark the reaction suggested above. Unilateral and bilateral mechanisms
                            appear to exist to provide this support; each has singular advantages or
                            disadvantages attached.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">PURPOSE:</p>
                        <p>Covert Action (<gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss>) could be undertaken
                            against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) with objectives ranging from harassment to the actual
                            overthrow of the present communist government. The principal purpose
                            would be to demonstrate to the Soviets and the Third World that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is not willing quietly to
                            acquiesce in the absorption of another country into the Soviet orbit.
                            The main risk in undertaking such a <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss>
                            program would come from the Soviet Union. In the event of a lightning,
                            and successful, coup d’etat in Kabul, it is unlikely that the Soviets
                            would intervene militarily. A gradually intensified insurgency could
                            lead to escalating Soviet military countermeasures. While the Soviets
                            would be unlikely to introduce line troops into Afghanistan, they could
                            easily provide virtually limitless supplies of military equipment,
                            military “advisors,” pilots, etc.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">UNILATERAL VS. MULTILATERAL <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>Limited <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> activities can be undertaken
                            unilaterally. For example, we can intensify our propaganda campaign and
                            supply funds to insurgent groups without collaborating with other
                            countries. Unilateral <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> has security
                            advantages, but would be far less effective than programs undertaken
                            jointly. Because of geographical considerations, the cooperation—or at
                            least tacit endorsement—of the Government of Pakistan (<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>) would be almost mandatory if we were
                            to provide significant material support to the insurgents. Such
                            cooperation is by no means assured; the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> would be likely to demand a high price in return for
                            its cooperation—viz. greatly increased military and economic assistance.
                            This would involve us in supporting the political status quo in
                            Pakistan. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> would run the risk of
                            its actions boomeranging, leading to serious instability in Pakistan.
                            The Afghans have the capability of stirring up Pakistan
                            tribals—particularly in Baluchistan. Some insurgent leaders have good
                            connections with Saudi Arabia, and there have been reports that aid from
                            that country already has been sent to exile leaders in the Peshawar
                            area. In view of the influence that Saudi Arabia has had on Pakistan,
                            the Saudis could usefully front for us with the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> and serve as a conduit for aid to the insurgents,
                            probably via exile elements. Other countries might play lesser roles.

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Propaganda—Outside Afghanistan.</hi> We could
                            generate a worldwide media campaign publicizing the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s problems, exposing <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his colleagues as pawns of
                            the Soviet Union. We could condemn <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> for attempting to force an atheistic philosophy
                            on the religious population and for violating civil rights. Such a
                            campaign could be conducted unilaterally or with the cooperation of
                            friendly governments such as [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. It would be virtually risk free, but probably
                            would have little impact within Afghanistan itself. It would, however,
                            establish the groundwork for additional <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> activities, including influencing Saudi Arabian and
                            other prospective donors of aid to the rebel cause.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Propaganda—Inside Afghanistan</hi>. Propaganda
                            material could be distributed inside Afghanistan. Afghans have a
                            tradition of employing “night letters”—clandestinely produced
                            leaflets—to register protest. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could
                            produce such material for non-attributable distribution in Kabul and
                            elsewhere in Afghanistan, but this obviously would entail considerable
                            risk for those involved. We cannot predict in advance the success of an
                            internal propaganda campaign or the overall effect it would have on the
                            regime. It probably would have the greatest impact if it were undertaken
                            in conjunction with a broader program of support for the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Propaganda—Radio</hi>. Radio broadcasts in Dari and
                            Pushtu in the standard broadcast band beamed into Afghanistan from
                            neighboring countries would require the cooperation of the Governments
                            of Pakistan and/or Iran.<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4"><persName corresp="#p_IKF_1">Inderfurth</persName> circled “/or Iran” and
                                drew a line to the bottom of the page, where he wrote: “I doubt the
                                Ayatollah (or <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bazargan</persName> for
                                that matter) would go along with this. <hi rend="italic">Maybe</hi>
                                later.”</note> In the past the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                            has transmitted propaganda into Afghanistan from a radio station in
                            Quetta. If relations between the two countries deteriorate, the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> might resume such broadcasts. Some
                            existing shortwave broadcasts, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>], also reach Afghanistan, and we could explore the
                            possibility of putting our message on this medium. Again, cooperation of
                            a third country would be essential. An airborne radio station also is
                            possible, but this too would have to be supported from a nearby country.
                            Satellite broadcasts theoretically could be arranged, but only at great
                            expense <pb n="109" facs="0154" xml:id="pg_109"/>and not in the near
                            term. If the radio propaganda option is being seriously considered, a
                            technical study would be required to determine the best way to reach the
                            Afghan radio audience. Assuming the broadcasts are fairly widely heard,
                            they could have a significant impact. If the broadcasts originated from
                            a neighboring country such as Pakistan, this would be considered a
                            serious hostile act and the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> could
                            be expected to take countermeasures.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Non-Lethal</hi>. The easiest way
                            to support the insurgents is to furnish them with money on a unilateral
                            basis. We have identified a number of Afghan exile leaders through whom
                            such funds could be channelled, although our ability to monitor how the
                            money actually is spent would be limited. A possibility also exists to
                            establish direct contact in Pakistan with Nuristan leaders, via
                            discreet, unilateral Pakistani intermediaries. If we wanted to remove
                            ourselves a step from such transactions, we might be able to get Saudi
                            Arabia to front for us, but this would further reduce the element of
                            control. Small amounts of non-lethal material such as medical supplies,
                            rations and low-grade communications equipment, might be furnished
                            unilaterally through Pakistan territory, although obviously this could
                            be done more easily with <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                            cooperation, or possibly by having the Saudis broker the deal with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance to the insurgents, whether in the form of
                            money or non-lethal supplies or both, could be expected to encourage the
                            anti-regime movement, but its ultimate effect would be difficult to
                            predict. If significant quantities of aid were involved, this could not
                            be kept secret. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> probably would
                            be accused of supporting the rebels by the Soviets and the Afghan press,
                            whether or not concrete proof was available. Nevertheless, plausible
                            denial could be maintained, or the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            might even admit to supplying “humanitarian aid” to the exiles.
                            Pakistan’s attitude would be critical. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> could be seriously embarrassed if it developed that an
                            increasingly creditable insurgency movement was operating from its
                            Northwest Frontier Province (<gloss target="#t_NWFP_1">NWFP</gloss>) and
                            might take steps to restrict activities of the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Lethal</hi>. Funds could be
                            provided to the insurgents to purchase lethal military equipment, as in
                            the non-lethal insurgency support option outlined above. Likewise, the
                            Saudis could be asked to front for us on this. Small amounts of lethal
                            equipment probably could be introduced clandestinely, but <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> cooperation would be required if
                            significant amounts were involved. Equipment which could upgrade the
                            insurgents’ combat capabilities might include small arms, sniper
                            equipment, light to medium crew-served weapons, unconventional
                            demolitions, and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Soviet <gloss target="#t_SA7_1">SA–7</gloss> missiles. Training also would be
                            required, and with full <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                            <pb n="110" facs="0155" xml:id="pg_110"/>cooperation, a small <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> team could handle this in <gloss target="#t_NWFP_1">NWFP</gloss>. Alternatively, Afghan rebel cadres
                            could be brought out of the area and trained in a third country such as
                            Saudi Arabia. From the standpoint of efficiency, the closer the training
                            team can operate to the scene of action, the better. Efficiency would be
                            lowered, but security enhanced, if American staff did not operate in
                            Pakistan. The results of modest but across-the-board support for the
                            insurgents would be hard to estimate. It could greatly improve the
                            insurgents’ military capability, sap the managerial resources of the
                            thinly staffed <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leadership, and
                            eventually lead to a revolt in the Army which would overthrow the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime. It also could
                            lead to increased Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, as we believe they
                            will take strong measures to ensure that the communist regime is not
                            displaced. A long drawn-out insurgency would result in great suffering
                            for the people involved, with no guarantee that a satisfactory outcome
                            would be achieved.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Coup d’etat</hi>. It is possible that the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime could be brought down
                            the same way it came to power—in a lightning coup d’etat. This would
                            have to be carefully planned and organized, and executed with precision.
                            As in the April 1978 coup, the aim would be to obtain support of key
                            military units and then move quickly to eliminate the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leadership. If successful, such a coup
                            would cause minimal bloodshed, and would be over before the Soviets had
                            time to react. A number of Afghans already have been arrested by the
                            regime on charges of coup plotting. At this point we do not know whether
                            there are viable anti-regime groups attempting to organize a coup such
                            as described, and it could well be that there are none. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> has not flinched from employing
                            draconian means to maintain internal security; regime leaders are well
                            protected by heavily armed guards and the political loyalty of key
                            military commanders has been carefully investigated. While dissidents
                            both inside and outside of Afghanistan may be discussing the theoretical
                            possibility of mounting a coup, little or no spadework may have been
                            done to prepare for this. Anti-regime exiles seem to have only
                            rudimentary contact with guerrillas operating in the border areas, and
                            presumably even poorer communications with potential dissident activists
                            in the capital. Nevertheless it is possible that a creditable
                            anti-regime underground could develop, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could make contact with it, probably via selected
                            anti-regime exiles. In theory we could then provide specialized support
                            including training, advice, non-attributable sniper rifles, explosives,
                            anti-tank weapons, communications equipment, etc. This material then
                            would have to be smuggled into Kabul—again implying the existence of a
                            well organized underground. The political risks to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be great, but probably <pb n="111" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_111"/>not much greater than if we
                            decided to provide quantities of lethal equipment and training for the

                    <p>The most damaging recent development has been the spread of fighting to the
                        previously quiet north and west. The causes of the revolt that broke out in
                        Herat last week and smaller outbreaks elsewhere are still unclear, but
                        Islamic opposition to the “godless” government may <pb n="112" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_112"/>have been the most important factor.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2" type="source">The uprising in Herat began on March 15 by
                            civilian insurgents, who were joined by resident Afghan Army troops who
                            had mutinied. The revolt ended on March 20 when Afghan Army troops loyal
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime entered the

                        religious communities by avoiding policies offensive to them. When criticism
                        of the government became more open last fall—perhaps encouraged by events in
                        Iran and by exiled religious leaders in Pakistan—<persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> cracked down.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">A reference to the Iranian revolution and the collapse

                    <p>Even if the armed forces succeed in suppressing the current rebellions,
                        insurgencies inspired by the Islamic opposition will almost certainly recur,
                        placing further strains on the loyalty of the Muslim soldiers. Rebellion in
                        the tribal areas along the Pakistani border broke out almost as soon as
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> came to power. The tribes
                        cannot campaign effectively outside their home areas but are holding their
                        own in the mountains. Probably more than half of the Army’s combat units are
                        now in tribal areas, and morale is declining because of casualties, tribal
                        loyalties, and the dim prospects for victory. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>So far—despite the defection of a large part of the Army garrison in Herat
                        and reports of daily desertions in the tribal areas—the bulk of the military
                        remains loyal to the government. Widespread arrests and dismissals have
                        prevented any successful move against <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> by disgruntled officers. At the same time, however,
                        the purges clearly reveal the continuing decline in the number of officers
                        the government is willing to trust and, along with the similar removal of
                        suspected opponents in the bureaucracy, have forced the government to rely
                        more and more on inexperienced party members. The few capable senior
                        officials—for example Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>—seem to have more to do than they can handle. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The economic situation is deteriorating. Poor weather has sharply reduced
                        agricultural production, foodgrain import requirements have increased, and
                        Kabul is shopping in world markets for early delivery of at least 400,000
                        tons of wheat. The government estimates that the shortfall in wheat
                        production this year will be between 700,000 to 800,000 tons. Foreign
                        exchange reserves are sufficient to pay for wheat imports, but Kabul still
                        faces problems in arranging for delivery. The Afghans have asked Pakistan to
                        expedite wheat shipments through the port of Karachi, but Islamabad has not
                        yet responded. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling

                        non-Communist neighbors are becoming more difficult. Although the Pakistani
                        Government is not now giving support to tribal dissidents, it is reportedly
                        making little effort to limit the activities of Afghan exiles in Pakistan
                        and may decide at some point to provide material aid. The new Iranian
                        Government apparently is continuing the Shah’s non-interventionist policy,
                        but anti-Afghan statements by Iranian leaders and verbal attacks on Iran
                        from Afghanistan have increased tension. The increasingly Islamic character
                        of the insurgency in Afghanistan could lead to a change in Iranian policy.

                        more noteworthy is Moscow’s willingness to jeopardize its relations with the

                        spreads to other urban areas of Afghanistan and if the military withdraws
                        its support from <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. Moscow’s
                        decision to publish two authoritative warnings in less than a week about
                        outside interference in Afghanistan is indicative of Soviet concern about a
                        possible replay in Afghanistan of recent developments in Iran. This is also
                        reflected in the current Soviet propaganda effort to portray the current
                        government as respectful of Islam and mindful of the teachings of the Koran.

                    <p>The Soviets would be most reluctant to introduce large numbers of ground
                        forces into Afghanistan to keep in power an Afghan Government that had lost
                        the support of virtually all segments of the population. Not only would the

                        recent military successes of Afghanistan rebel units. They believe that
                        these units have accomplished major victories in spite of a lack of weapons,
                        money and logistical support. They are also impressed by what they believe
                        to be the firm steps taken by the various rebel organizations to unify their
                        efforts under the Afghanistan National Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>2. Although the Saudis are in sympathetic contact with various members of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>, they continue to withhold any
                        real financial support to the <gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>. Crown
                        Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd bin ’Abd al-’Aziz</persName> has
                        made it clear to Pakistani President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia-ul-Huq</persName> that Saudi Arabia will provide no significant aid
                        to the <gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss> unless <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> agrees to the aid. At the moment, Saudi
                        and Pakistan Governments are in continuous contact on this issue. In
                        mid-March <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> informed Crown Prince
                            <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName> that he believed that any

                        cause him problems with the Soviet Union, which, at the moment, he perceives
                        to be almost insurmountable. Because of their promise not to aid the <gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss> without <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s approval, senior members of the Saudi Government are
                        considering making a discreet approach to the United States Government

                        of the Afghan dissidents against the Kabul regime, and say that they “cannot

                        “repression”—would no longer be a problem. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> also told the Soviet Ambassador that Afghan hostility

                        Soviet Ambassador Azimov to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> on March 26. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> read carefully from the démarche, which began by
                        referring to the Soviet role in “trying to promote the normalization of

                        states.</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviet note then went on to say that “groups hostile to the Democratic

                        in Pakistan,” and that “armed gangs of saboteurs and terrorists were
                        penetrating into Afghanistan.” The Soviet note described these groups as
                        “counter-revolutionaries,” who “freely roamed up and down the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan border,” and were on the attack
                        because of their opposition to “the reforms” now being carried out in
                        Afghanistan by the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. The note <pb n="118" facs="0163" xml:id="pg_118"/>accuses the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> of “connivance” in this anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> activity, and says such action could lead
                        to “severe aggravation in <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan
                        relations.”</p>
                    <p>7. The note goes on to say that the “Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent
                        to such developments,” especially when “aimed at a country with which the
                        Soviet Union has a treaty of friendship which it values.” Moscow “will not
                        allow” Afghanistan to “become the object of attack no matter what the
                        source.”</p>
                    <p>8. The Soviet note concludes by saying that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is delivering this message “in a frank and friendly
                        manner,” and that Moscow would “not like to believe that the use of
                        Pakistani territory” for dissident activity “goes on with your knowledge.”
                        The note says that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> should consider
                        the démarche with “all seriousness which this question deserves.”</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> then read from what I presume
                        is a written summary of President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s reply to Ambassador Azimov. According to <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> told the Soviet Ambassador that:</p>
                    <p>—he “strongly rejected” the Soviet accusation about the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>’s alleged connivance with anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> dissidents; and that,</p>
                    <p>—the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has “scrupulously remained tied” to
                        its policy of “non-intervention,” and has “done everything possible to keep
                        the refugees from engaging in anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        activities.”</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> told Azimov that to try to
                        keep the Afghan refugees under control, the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has established two refugee camps—one at Warsak and the
                        other at Tarbela—and that Azimov could visit either of them at any time to
                        satisfy himself that no guerrilla training or other military activity is
                        taking place. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said that there are
                        now 35,000 Afghan refugees in Pakistan and that they are arriving at the
                        rate of 5,000 per month. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>, according
                        to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, has been doing the best it
                        can to keep the groups under control, and has warned Pakistani politicians
                        not to make statements that will incite refugee activity, or be construed as
                        anti-Afghan. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has ordered the refugee groups to cease
                        holding press conferences, and that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                        has provided “no arms, no training, and no financial support, other than
                        humanitarian aid” to the refugees.</p>
                    <p>11. The President told the Soviet Ambassador that the real root of the
                        refugee problem is in the “repression carried out against the Afghan
                        population by the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>”. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> told Azimov that Moscow should “impress
                        upon Kabul” the need to avoid creating “the conditions that cause the
                        exodus.” According to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, Islamabad
                        would be willing to cooperate with Kabul in preventing the entry of
                        refugees. (When I queried <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> about
                        this later, he said that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> meant
                        that, if the Afghans close their border, the Paks would cooperate. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> did not think this a “very realistic
                        proposition” because the border is so porous.)</p>
                    <p><pb n="119" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_119"/>12. On a government-to-government
                        level, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said, he would continue to
                        take “all the steps within his power” to see that “no hostile acts against
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> originated in Pakistan.” He said,
                        however, that the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government
                        in Kabul is becoming increasingly aggressive, and cited as examples the
                        recent shelling of two villages in Pakistan, and the “three dozen”
                        violations of Pakistani airspace by <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        planes. One violation occurred less than six weeks ago, when a <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> plane penetrated “thirty miles” into
                        Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said that he had “so
                        far” ordered his forces not to shoot, and that he has contented himself with
                        protests to Kabul, but he said that the next <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> aircraft to violate <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>
                        airspace “would be shot down.”</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> concluded by noting that he
                        was affronted to be accused of complicity in the “half-hearted attempts by
                        the Afghan dissidents” to overthrow the Kabul regime, and that, if the
                            “<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> was really hostile to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>” it could make “life difficult” for the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> decried the “substantial campaign of
                        false allegations against the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>” carried
                        on by the Soviet media. The Soviet démarche, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said, “is stronger and more explicit” than anything the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has heard from the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>, and that Moscow’s invocation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> treaty will “only encourage Afghanistan to persist in its
                        hostile attitude” toward Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> believes this démarche came from the
                        “highest levels in Moscow” and that it “perhaps” reflects Soviet Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>’s personal views.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> sees <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>’s hand behind the recent <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> articles, and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> has a report that <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> told Indian FonMin <persName corresp="#p_VAB_1">Vajpayee</persName> in Delhi that “Pakistan is behind
                        all of the dissident activity in Afghanistan.”</p>
                    <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> told me that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is taking the Soviet démarche “very
                        seriously” and is not treating it as an “empty threat or bluff.” <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> reasons that Moscow is “nursing its
                        anger” over the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>’s decision to ban
                        Soviet overflights to Vietnam, and Pakistan’s subsequent refusal to succumb
                        to Soviet pressure at the risk of harming its relations with China.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> noted that Moscow has
                        suffered a “setback” in the Sino-Vietnam conflict and “could be expected” to
                        seek an opportunity to “reestablish its credibility as a superpower.”</p>
                    <p>16. The Advisor said that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> labors
                        with a set of contradictions in the matter. The “brutal oppression” of
                        Afghans has caused “real unhappiness” in Pakistan and elsewhere. In fact,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said, when he was in Tehran
                        the <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Ayatollah Khomeini</persName> “asked me to
                        convey a message to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>” about its
                        repression of “religious people.” <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that he told <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> that such a message might “drive the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> to even more repression,” but the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> delivered <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName>’s message to the Afghan Ambassador in Islamabad
                        anyway. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said he also made a
                        direct appeal to Afghan FonMin <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        to stop oppressing Muslims. <pb n="120" facs="0165" xml:id="pg_120"/><persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that, as expected,
                        the appeals have “incensed the Afghans,” who are having a hard time
                        maintaining control over the country, and now—with both Iran and Pakistan
                        having risked Soviet wrath—Moscow has stepped into the breach.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that it is in this
                        context that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> “seeks a
                        clarification” of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy in relation to
                        the 1959 bilateral. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that
                        both DepSec <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> and
                        Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> have
                        told the Paks that the bilateral remains in force, although <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that the DepSec had said that
                        the treaty is “twenty years old and needs a new scope of definition.”<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3"><persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> on March 1 in Islamabad. The Embassy reported on the

                        that the bilateral indeed remains in force, and that any “new definitions”
                        mentioned by the DepSec were in the nature of expanding economic assistance
                        to Pakistan (not covered in the bilateral), as a reflection of our desire to
                        be more help to the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>. I also reminded
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> of my call on <gloss target="#t_FonSec_1">FonSec</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>, in which I presented the
                        Department Spokesman’s comments that we would regard external involvement in
                        Afghanistan’s internal problems as a serious matter with the potential of
                        heightening tensions and destabilizing the situation in the entire
                        region.</p>
                    <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that a clarification
                        was very important to the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> at this time
                        because “if we have to deal with this threat alone we will take one policy,”
                        but “if we feel the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is behind us we can
                        be courteous but firm” in a response to pressure from Moscow and the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said the military situation is “not academic” because
                        Saudi Arabia has asked Pakistan for military manpower, and, while the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> can provide training and maintenance
                        personnel now, “if they want more” to counter Soviet moves in the Yemen”,
                        then the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> will have to gauge carefully
                        its own military situation.</p>
                    <p>19. When I asked <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> what concrete
                        Soviet action the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> fears, he said that
                        there is a real concern that “<gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> agents”
                        will begin to work in Baluchistan, and this, combined with the “incitement
                        of ethnics” already happening in Iran under Soviet tutelage, could make
                        Pakistan a “target of opportunity for the Soviets.” Baluchistan is an even
                        more likely target, <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> maintained,
                        because Baluch leaders—“such as Bizenjo”—are already “pro-Soviet.”</p>
                    <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> agreed that one reason for
                        the Soviet démarche may be that things are getting out of hand in
                        Afghanistan, and he suggested that Moscow may be preparing Communist and
                        other international opinion for an intervention along the lines of “Hungary
                        or Czechoslovakia.”</p>
                    <p><pb n="121" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_121"/>21. I told <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> that I understood the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>’s concerns and appreciated the seriousness
                        of their request for clarification. I said that I would report our
                        conversation fully to Washington.</p>
                    <p>22. The Advisor said that he would see the Chinese Ambassador evening of
                        March 28 to deliver the same message and that <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> Ambassadors in Beijing, Washington, and Moscow have already

                            counseled that the United States should “avoid an initial linkage
                            between the 1959 bilateral and the nuclear issue. To tie them together
                            would confirm Pakistan’s worst fears about American policy in this area,
                            i.e., that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is prepared to see
                            Pakistan go the way of Afghanistan.” Instead, <persName corresp="#p_CPD_1">Constable</persName> recommended, the United
                            States should inform Pakistan that “we see the 1959 bilateral as
                            precisely intended to provide for Pakistan’s security against aggression
                            by a Communist or Communist-dominated power—a definition which includes

                        United States was meddling in Afghan affairs. (See <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.) <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s memorandum to Director of Central Intelligence
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Stansfield Turner</persName>, March 30,
                        transmitted <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s request to
                        strongly rebuke the Soviet allegation of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement in overthrowing the Afghan Government.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> went on: “All
                        information available to us in recent days has tended to indicate quite the
                        contrary: that the Soviet Union is preparing to intervene in Afghanistan to
                        prop up an unpopular leftist regime and is, in fact, already doing most of
                        the things it is accusing the United States and other countries of doing or

                        taken by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to counter Soviet
                        allegations: on March 31, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> tasked
                        all field stations “to make specific effort to expose the nature and extent
                        of the Soviet role in Afghanistan, and to characterize this interference as
                        a growing threat to regional stability.” <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> noted: “this tasking expanded on an earlier
                        requirement sent to the field on 17 February to ‘intensify covert action
                        efforts directed at exposing Soviet machinations in Iran and Afghanistan.’”

                        with more media placement forthcoming. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> noted that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        was preparing “a series of black propaganda operations designed to support
                        the tribal revolt in Afghanistan, to encourage uncommitted Afghans to back
                        the dissidents, and to stimulate foreign support for the dissidents,” in

                    <p>On 5 March 1979 we forwarded for <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                        consideration a paper on covert action options for Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">See <ref target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note> This
                        paper outlines specific proposals for support of Afghan dissidents and
                        insurgents.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <p>In recent weeks Afghan dissidents have stepped up their insurgency against
                        the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>) and have achieved surprising successes, despite having few
                        weapons and almost no outside support. The rebellion which heretofore has
                        been centered mainly in Afghanistan’s eastern provinces, broke out in Herat,
                        a major city near the western border. Although our information is
                        incomplete, it appears there were large scale defections from Army units in
                        Herat. <pb n="125" facs="0170" xml:id="pg_125"/>The Soviets clearly are
                        concerned about setbacks to the Afghan communist regime, and have airlifted
                        military equipment to help shore it up. Soviet media also has accused
                        Pakistan, Egypt and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> of supporting
                        the insurgency.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Government of Pakistan (<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>) is crucial in considering most <gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> options. Recently, the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                        has signaled to us that it may be much more forthcoming than we previously
                        believed. President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, in an 11
                        March interview in the Saudi magazine <hi rend="italic">Ukaz</hi>, implied
                        that Islamabad would like to support the anti-communist, pro-Islamic
                        dissidents, but has not because of Soviet support for Kabul, which might
                        “burn Islamabad’s fingers,” and doubts as to the real strength of the Afghan
                        dissidents. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> also said Pakistan
                        cannot act in isolation; it must be backed by other countries in any such
                        move. The Director of the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate
                            (<gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss>) requested a meeting on 28 March
                        1979 with the Chief of Station, Islamabad to discuss possible assistance to
                        the Afghan insurgents. He said that the Afghans badly need small arms and
                        ammunition and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> “surely could
                        find a way to provide some assistance.” He added that he would guarantee
                        that anything provided the Peshawar-based rebels would be put to good use.
                        He said it is current <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy not to
                        support the rebels “without a firm commitment from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, Pakistan could not risk Soviet
                        wrath.”</p>
                    <p>In a separate development, the head of the Saudi Arabian Intelligence Service
                        raised the Afghan question [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] and noted that there was a real possibility that the
                        Soviets would suffer a setback in Afghanistan. He said the Saudi Government
                        was considering officially proposing that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid the rebels. This approach indicates the possibility of
                        trilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan-Saudi cooperation
                        in this area. At a minimum, the Saudis could be expected to provide funds
                        and also use their influence with the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                        to encourage Pakistan assistance to the dissidents. Other countries,
                        probably including China, could be expected to provide at least tacit
                        support for our programs.</p>
                    <p>Soviet response to various options should be carefully gauged. We already
                        have been falsely accused of aiding the rebels in Soviet media, and such
                        accusations could be expected to intensify as we move forward with various
                        programs. The Soviets easily can resupply the Afghan armed forces and they
                        undoubtedly will step up their military aid to counter guerrilla successes.
                        While the Soviets could provide additional “advisors,” pilots, etc., we
                        believe they are unlikely to introduce regular troops. Should they elect to
                        occupy the country militarily, there would be no practical way to stop them.
                        Such a move, however, would cause serious damage to the Soviet image in the
                        region and should serve to undermine Soviet influence and prestige
                        throughout much of the world.</p>

                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representatives have been instructed not
                        to delve too deeply with Afghan sources into the theoretical possibility of
                        clandestine support for the rebels, for fear of giving them false signals
                        regarding <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intentions. Much specific
                        information is therefore not now available. Listed below are a number of
                        options, rough cost estimates and a summary of pros and cons for each.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Radio Broadcasts from Pakistan</hi></p>
                    <p>Radio Pakistan has several stations which broadcast regularly into
                        Afghanistan. Assuming <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> cooperation,
                        these stations could be used for propaganda purposes, with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> assisting in the programming.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Costs:</hi> [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                        declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Pros:</hi> Communications are very poorly developed in
                        Afghanistan, and radio is the best means quickly to reach a large Afghan
                        audience. Costs would be moderate as we would be using existing broadcasting
                        facilities and existing staff including linguists. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> hand would be hidden.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi>
                        <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> cooperation would be required. Pakistan
                        would be openly identified as opposing the Afghan regime; this would provoke
                        Soviet/Afghan wrath and possible retaliation. In extremis, the Afghans might
                        even attempt to bomb or sabotage the radio stations. More subtly, the
                        Afghans could stir up trouble for Pakistan in Baluchistan and Northwest
                        Frontier Provinces.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Direct Financial Aid</hi></p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is in contact with a number of Afghan
                        emigres who could serve as conduits for funds to the insurgents. These funds
                        could be used to buy arms, supplies, etc., as the dissidents saw fit.
                        Because a unified military command has not yet emerged, at least initially
                        we would consider providing several groups with relatively small amounts and
                        then evaluate which uses the funds most effectively.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Costs:</hi> [<hi rend="italic">1 line not

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Pros:</hi> This would be the easiest way to supply badly
                        needed encouragement and support for the anti-communist rebels. Direct
                        funding <pb n="127" facs="0172" xml:id="pg_127"/>could be handled
                        unilaterally. Explicit <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> cooperation
                        would not be required, although tacit approval for the movement of arms and
                        material through Pakistan and the continued use of Pakistan territory for
                        training, etc., would be needed. Nevertheless deniability could be
                        maintained by both the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Pakistan.
                        Although we would attempt to maintain secrecy, word of our assistance would
                        leak (or we could deliberately leak it). This would demonstrate to informed
                        Pakistanis, Saudis and others that we are willing to underwrite the Afghan
                        fight against communism and stand up to the Soviets. Through our funds, we
                        should be able to exercise some influence over the insurgents, encourage
                        them to put aside their parochial differences and improve their efficiency.
                        Assuming they are ultimately successful in overthrowing the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>, our contribution to this process should
                        give us some influence on the Afghan Government that subsequently
                        emerges.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi> Control on how our funds are used would be
                        difficult. Money could be wasted, stolen or used to support intramural
                        battles among the emigres.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Indirect Financial Aid</hi></p>
                    <p>Financial aid would be provided as in Option 2, except we would use a third
                        party such as the Saudis or Pakistanis as an intermediary.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Pros:</hi> This approach should encourage a team effort.
                        For example, if we used the Saudis, they should be encouraged to add their
                        contributions to ours. With this option, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> hand would be better hidden than in the case of direct
                        financial aid.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi> We would lose much control over how the funds
                        would be spent, and also much of the influence which would accrue through
                        dealing directly with the Afghan dissidents.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Non-Lethal Material</hi></p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could provide a variety of non-lethal
                        material support to the dissidents in Pakistan. Full <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> cooperation would be required, however.
                        Under this option we would propose to equip a 2,000-man force for one

                        better able to influence events. The medical supplies and some of the other
                        equipment could be handled under the rubric of “humanitarian assistance.”
                        Once a supply channel to the rebels is established, it later could be used,
                        if desired, to provide them with other types of material including lethal

                        unconventional warfare assistance to the Afghans, an on-site survey in
                        Pakistan would be required to develop a detailed operational plan. The team
                        would hold discussions with <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> officials
                        and dissident leaders, survey potential training and support facilities in
                        Pakistan, determine support requirements and control procedures, and finally
                        draft a plan of action. The survey team would consist of approximately five
                        specialists and the survey would take three-four weeks.</p>

                        Security, or at least plausible denial, could be maintained. However, our

                            deteriorates further, Pakistan may be forced to make some hard choices
                            and may no longer be able to have it both ways.” To that end, the
                            Department asked a number of questions regarding future Pakistani policy
                            toward Afghanistan, and repeated the telegram to the Embassies in New

                        comment on possible Soviet conduct in the evolving Afghanistan situation, we
                        would note at the outset the obvious fact that the Soviets have a major
                        investment in the Kabul regime which they will go to some lengths to
                        protect. We doubt, however, that the Soviet leadership would seriously
                        consider the large-scale dispatch of Soviet combat troops to Afghanistan
                        under foreseeable circumstances.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">In telegram 2778

                            in fact, offer direct military assistance to the Afghan Government, a
                            request for which would not be made “unless the leadership were
                            genuinely desperate in the face of a hopelessly deteriorating domestic

                        direct Soviet military involvement are possible in situations where Soviet
                        personnel or equipment were endangered, if foreign forces were seen as
                        assisting the anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> regime inside
                        Afghanistan, or if fighting approached Soviet borders. We believe that
                        Moscow is not irrevocably wedded to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. In the coming weeks and months, it will be prepared
                        to stick with him or to adopt other options, with the choice depending in
                        large measure on developments within Afghanistan itself. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. We continue to see Moscow’s policy toward Afghanistan as twofold: (A) to
                        assist the Khalqi regime to consolidate power and eliminate its
                        “counter-revolutionary” opponents, and (B) to draw Afghanistan into closer
                        dependence on the Soviet Union in economic, military, administrative and
                        other areas, while maneuvering to reduce Western and Chinese presence and
                        influence in Afghanistan. The December 5, 1978, Soviet-Afghan treaty served
                        to institutionalize close Soviet-Afghan relations and has been followed by
                        further efforts by both governments to deepen their relationship.<note n="5" xml:id="d46fn5">See <ref target="#d33fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            33</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>4. The Soviets have made a considerable investment in Afghanistan which they
                        will go to some lengths to protect through additional steps to shore up the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime. Afghanistan’s
                        proximity to the Soviet Union and recent setbacks to Soviet foreign policy
                        interests and perhaps <pb n="132" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_132"/>prestige in
                        the Middle East and Asia will reinforce this commitment. So will any
                        Soviet-perceived efforts by other outside powers—particularly China—to
                        support the anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> insurgency.</p>
                    <p>5. Under foreseeable circumstances, we do not anticipate the large-scale
                        dispatch of combat troops to Afghanistan as an option that would be
                        seriously considered by the Soviet leadership for the following reasons:</p>
                    <p>—such a move might worsen Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        relations during a delicate period when <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and a summit are high on our respective agendas;</p>
                    <p>—the popular opposition to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        might only be exacerbated by direct Soviet actions, and would leave open the
                        possibility that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s
                        survivability would require the continuing presence and possible ongoing
                        engagement of Soviet combat troops;</p>
                    <p>—the spectre of Soviet troops battling Islamic elements would redound to
                        Moscow’s disadvantage throughout the Moslem world, especially in Islamic
                        states which Moscow is currently courting, such as Iran and Saudi
                        Arabia;</p>
                    <p>—Moscow’s chief interest in the region is its ties with India. New Delhi
                        would presumably strongly oppose direct Soviet intervention, which would
                        make clear Moscow’s intention to consider Afghanistan—like
                        Czechoslovakia—part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                        “imperium”.</p>
                    <p>6. The provision of various forms of direct Soviet military assistance to
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces short of the dispatch of
                        regular Soviet combat units is, however, more of a possibility. Such direct
                        assistance could come as a result of Soviet attempts to protect or defend
                        Soviet personnel or equipment already in Afghanistan, as may have already
                        occurred at Herat. Or, depending on circumstances in combat areas inside
                        Afghanistan, for example, in Badakhshan adjoining Soviet Tadzhikistan where
                        the Soviet press has already reported some fighting has broken out, the
                        Soviets could decide to provide support through the dispatch of Soviet
                        aircraft, helicopter gunships, or increased advisory personnel on the ground
                        to assist the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> anti-insurgent efforts.
                        The temptation to provide this type of direct if limited military assistance
                        would be heightened if the Soviets believed that foreign forces from
                        Pakistan or Iran had actually joined the resistance inside Afghanistan, or
                        if the fighting approached Soviet borders. Even in these situations,
                        however, we believe that Moscow, for the reasons cited above, would attempt
                        to minimize the scope and visibility of direct Soviet military participation
                        in the fighting.</p>
                    <p>7. To check what they may see as passive or active <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> support to anti-<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        insurgents, the Soviets, in coordination with the Afghans, may become more
                        direct in warning the Paks about possible retaliation “in kind” through
                        Soviet-Afghan support to Baluchi and Pushtu dissi<pb n="133" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_133"/>dent elements inside Pakistan. Should the Soviets view
                        the Paks as working with others, particularly the Chinese, in supporting a
                        widening insurgency inside Afghanistan, these warnings could conceivably be
                        translated into actions, despite the drawbacks mentioned in Islamabad
                            3775.<note n="6" xml:id="d46fn6">In telegram 3775 from Islamabad, March
                            30, the Embassy responded to telegram 73004 (see <ref target="#d46fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above). Regarding the fear of Soviet aggression,
                            the Embassy laid out three assumptions about Pakistan’s policy: “(A) A
                            crisis in <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan relations may be
                            unavoidable, in time, if the Afghans continue their present policies;
                            (B) Pakistan would prefer that such a crisis come later rather than
                            sooner; and (C) time may be on Pakistan’s side as dissidence inside
                            Afghanistan mounts possibly to levels sufficient to threaten the regime
                            itself or at least to temper the activist naiveté of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leadership.” Regarding a question
                            posed in telegram 73004, the Embassy answered that there were
                            “undoubtedly elements within Pakistan’s political life which would
                            support a more activist/interventionist policy in Afghanistan,” which
                            included the various conservative religious, nationalistic, and tribal
                            factions in the country. But the Embassy noted that such support had its
                            limits: any interventionist policy in Afghanistan would have to be
                            effective to remain popular, and not so confrontational as to provoke a
                            hostile, Soviet-backed response by the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss>

                    <p>8. The Soviets will be weighing the relative positions of strength of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his domestic
                        opponents in making their decisions on providing assistance to the Kabul
                        regime. If a growing domestic challenge to the regime should progressively
                        spread and reach a point where it is poised to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, or if <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> is unable to maintain the military’s loyalty, we
                        believe the Soviets will be prepared to consider other alternatives to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. Soviet decision-making
                        in such a situation would be guided by a combination of cold pragmatism and
                        opportunism and would be directed at the longer-range goal of establishing a
                        rapport with—or influencing the selection of—the individual, group or
                        coalition most likely to emerge at the top.</p>
                    <p>9. In this connection we have picked up a number of indications that, behind
                        the froth of public Soviet comments about <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, Moscow may not see him as the Afghan wave of the
                        future. Our Soviet contacts occasionally express irritation at his
                        indecisive pace in implementing socio-economic programs and his purge of
                        what are seen here as “progressive” elements, such as the Parchamists. One
                        leading specialist on “Middle Asia” who knows the Khalqi leaders personally
                        once blurted out to an <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> that he
                        “felt hatred” for Afghan First Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">H.
                            Amin</persName>. In a recent conversation with two EmbOffs, the Deputy
                        Director of Dushanbe’s Oriental Institute twice stated that “only time will
                        tell” if the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime will be
                        able to survive.</p>
                    <p>10. In sum, we see a range of considerations relating to domestic Afghan as
                        well as regional and international factors—including, of course, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attitude—as likely to influence Soviet
                        decisions on assisting what may be an increasingly beleaguered <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime. Mos<pb n="134" facs="0179" xml:id="pg_134"/>cow will very likely be keeping its options under
                        continuing review as events in Afghanistan unfold in the coming months.</p>

                            The memorandum was one of several papers prepared for the April 6 <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting. See <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>. In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, April 4, <persName corresp="#p_HP_1">Henze</persName> characterized this memorandum and the paper, <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>, as “serious intelligence papers
                            that provide a basis for realistic discussion.” Still, <persName corresp="#p_HP_1">Henze</persName> noted, the Department of State
                            was not enthusiastic about implementing the proposals, while <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> personnel were divided as well:
                                “<persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> wants to please

                            position. All this is clearly sensed by the sharp minds that still exist

                            because they do not believe the Agency has the capability to carry them
                            out effectively in the field. Others are primarily concerned about what
                            they consider to be inevitable leaks which will cause the Administration
                            to back down, even if it does launch some of this activity, and leave

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Comments</p>
                    <p>Consideration of possible Soviet responses to proposed US covert action
                        options is dominated by one large and irreducible uncertainty: How far are
                        the Soviet leaders prepared to go in support of the Teraki regime in the
                        absence of significant and visible external assistance to insurgents?</p>
                    <p>If successful, US covert action assistance to insurgents would increase
                        Afghanistan’s need for Soviet support and, if the Soviets are willing to
                        provide it, would raise the military and political costs of larger and more
                        visible increments of Soviet assistance. If the Soviets are determined to
                        keep the Teraki regime in power, including, if necessary, by committing
                        Soviet combat forces on a substantial scale, even the most extensive covert
                        action programs cannot prevent them from doing so. It is true that external
                        assistance to insurgents, particularly <pb n="135" facs="0180" xml:id="pg_135"/>if and when it became more visible, would be exploited
                        by the Soviets to justify their own deepening involvement. But this line
                        will be taken by the Soviets in any case to justify their own increased
                        support for the Teraki regime, whether or not insurgency is substantially
                        aided by covert action. The Soviets are already making such charges.<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">See <ref target="#d43">Documents 43</ref> and <ref target="#d44">44</ref>.</note> Successful covert action would
                        however raise the costs to the Soviets of larger and more visible increments
                        in their role. It would inflame Moslem opinion in many countries against the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, which would be seen as
                        suppressing a religious-motivated insurgency.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if the Soviet leaders are uncertain how far they are
                        prepared to go to rescue the Teraki regime, and are waiting to see if
                        smaller increments of help will suffice, then a substantial covert action
                        program, particularly if highly visible, could raise their stake in the
                        issue. It is conceivable that some Soviets could view such a heightened US
                        role as enhancing the dangers and uncertainties of more direct Soviet combat
                        involvement, and therefore as additional cause for caution. But it is more
                        likely that a large US-backed covert action operation would be seen as a
                        challenge on their periphery, and would induce them to intervene more
                        directly and vigorously than otherwise intended. While we believe the
                        Soviets are strongly predisposed to aid this Afghan regime—which is
                        ideologically sympathetic, closely tied to them, and most important,
                        geographically contiguous—we have as yet insufficient basis for judging in
                        which direction they are so far leaning on the subject of eventual combat
                        intervention.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternative Options</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Radio Broadcasts from Pakistan:</hi> The Soviets are
                        already heavily denouncing Pakistan and the US in their own propaganda as
                        responsible for the Afghan insurgency, and they will probably continue to do
                        so, no matter what the US and Pakistan do, so long as a serious security
                        problem remains in Afghanistan. In the event of the Pakistan propaganda
                        counteroffensive with covert US support postulated, the Soviets would
                        probably escalate their rhetoric somewhat more, and would be likely to make
                        additional diplomatic demarches in Islamabad in protest, citing broadcast
                        evidence of Pakistani support for the insurgents.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this, the main potential Soviet lever in dealings with Pakistan is the
                        possibility that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might retaliate
                        by inciting unrest among Pakistan’s Baluchi tribes. So long as a major
                        Afghan insurgency continued, the Afghan regime might hesitate to attempt
                        this itself because of fear that Baluchi separatism in Pakistan might spread
                        to Afghanistan and compound the security problem. The Soviets, how<pb n="136" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_136"/>ever, probably have some
                        independent capability to bring pressure upon Pakistan in more measured and
                        insulated fashion by inciting activity by Marxist groups among Pakistan’s
                        Baluchis. It is conceivable that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        might begin to do this in response to a sustained Pakistani radio propaganda
                        aimed at Afghanistan. The degree of provocation the Soviets would perceive,
                        however, would be considerably less than would be the case in the combat
                        support options below. The US hand would not be very visible, the Pakistanis
                        could claim that their propaganda was a response to that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and the Soviets might be reluctant to
                        burn their bridges to Islamabad too quickly. As time went on, however, if
                        Pakistani broadcasts were perceived by the Soviets as having a significant
                        inflammatory effect upon the Afghan population and as worsening the security
                        situation, the Soviets would be progressively more likely to play the
                        Baluchi card.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Direct Financial Aid</hi>. Soviets
                        would of course exploit the expected leakage of the fact of such aid in
                        their own already ongoing propaganda campaign, and use this as evidence that
                        the revolt from the start had been US-instigated. The Soviets would use this
                        in the West and in the US in an effort to paint US policy as provocative and
                        reactionary, and thus to generate internal counterpressures on US policy
                        machinery. Likelihood of Soviet attempts to injure Pakistan, however, would
                        not be significantly greater than it is already in absence of such funding,
                        since the Pakistan government position would remain essentially what it is
                        now—one of tacit connivance rather than active encouragement and direction
                        of insurgent use of Pakistan territory.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Indirect Financial Aid</hi>. In this
                        case, with the US somewhat less visible and vulnerable and the Saudis and
                        Paks proportionately more so, Soviet incentives to exert pressure on the
                        latter two would be increased. The Saudis already fund a wide variety of
                        anti-Soviet projects in various areas (from the Middle East to Angola), and
                        the additional Soviet incentive for wanting to be able to change these Saudi
                        policies and Saudi regime would be superfluous. There is little that the
                        Soviets themselves can do, in practice, to retaliate against the Saudis; it
                        is other Arabs who possess what leverage exists on the Saudis, and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has only a marginal capability to
                        affect the extent of such pressure. In any case, most Arab governments,
                        including most “progressive” ones, would sympathize with Moslem insurgents
                        seeking to overthrow a communist regime in Afghanistan. The Pakistani
                        government, however, would be considerably more vulnerable to pressure from
                        the Soviets if it followed this option, and the chances that the Soviets
                        would move toward employment of their Baluchi option would rise.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Insurgency Support—Non-Lethal Material</hi>. This would
                        not significantly change the equation spelled out in (3) so far as Soviets
                        are <pb n="137" facs="0182" xml:id="pg_137"/>concerned, except that the
                        scope of the operation would be somewhat enlarged, and with it, the
                        visibility. The distinction between non-lethal and lethal would be believed
                        by nobody, even if it were closely maintained; hence it would not
                        significantly reduce Pakistan-US propaganda vulnerability below that which
                        would otherwise exist.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Unconventional Warfare Support—On-Site Survey</hi>. In
                        view of the unsatisfactory state of present US knowledge of the nature,
                        extent of and potential for support of the Afghan insurgency from Pakistani
                        soil, this option is one which should logically precede all the others. If
                        the Soviets became aware of such a survey, they might interpret it as a
                        possible harbinger of a more active US role both in the Afghan insurgency
                        effort and in providing security backing for Pakistan against Soviet
                        pressure. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> drew this conclusion
                        it would be likely to become more active diplomatically. The Soviets would
                        seek to alarm the Indians about an imminent strengthening of the US security
                        relationship with Pakistan. They would present more demarches to the
                        Pakistanis about the dangers Islamabad was bringing on itself by tying
                        itself to an unreliable and ephemeral US relationship. Beyond this, however,
                        the Soviets would probably wait upon events before taking more vigorous
                        action.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">6. and 7: Unconventional Warfare Support—Phases I and
                            II.</hi> At some point in the sequence between phases I and II, the
                        Soviets would be likely to begin to incite unrest among Pakistan’s Baluchis,
                        if they had not already done so. The Soviets in this phase would also become
                        more likely to make a direct demarche to the US, warning Washington against
                        expanding interference in fraternal Afghanistan. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might now add demarches to leaders they
                        might think susceptible in Western Europe, arguing that the US was once
                        again venturing on the same adventuristic line of policy that proved so
                        disastrous in Vietnam, that the US was endangering the stability of detente
                        not only between US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> but also for
                        West Europeans, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had
                        demonstrated its responsibility and restraint during the Sino-Vietnamese
                        war, in contrast to US incitement of that war, but that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could not be expected to stand idly by
                        and see a socialist neighboring state undermined and “destabilized” as in
                        distant Chile by the perfidious <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. In
                        talking to the Iranians, the Soviets would seek to counter anti-Kabul
                        sentiments in Tehran by playing upon Iranian paranoia about US imperialism
                        left over from the Shah relationship, and by intensifying any efforts which
                        may be already under way to persuade <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> that US covert action is responsible for some of
                        Iran’s present troubles with its own minorities. Finally, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would seek to alarm the Indians about an
                        imminent strengthening of the US security relationship with Pakistan, and
                        would <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> suggest that the US was about to
                        adopt a more permissive attitude toward Pakistan’s acquisition of a nuclear
                        capability.</p>

                        At these stages, to the degree that this support from Pakistan was seen by
                        the Soviets as becoming critical for the insurgency, this might tip the
                        balance in Soviet thinking on whether to commit ground combat forces to
                        Afghanistan. That is, the Soviet decision on this point would to some extent
                        begin to be influenced not only by the gravity of the insurgency itself, but
                        also by the fact of a perceived US challenge. At the same time, the
                        possibility would rapidly begin to grow that the Afghan military authorities
                        might react directly against Pakistani base areas. If Soviet combat forces
                        were present, they might under some circumstances take part in such a
                        cross-border punitive operation. The Soviets would be particularly likely to
                        move in this direction if the US security relationship with Pakistan
                        remained somewhat ambiguous.</p>
                    <p>If, on the other hand, the US had in the meantime negotiated a clear and
                        strongly-enunciated security relationship with the Paks which the US had
                        unambiguously communicated to Moscow, the Soviets would be less likely to
                        allow their own forces to respond with raids into Pakistan, but would in any
                        case seek to enhance Kabul’s ability to do so. The Soviets would in the
                        meantime vigorously seek to exploit Indian fears and resentment of such an
                        unambiguous US military tie to Pakistan.</p>

                            stage. It was understood, however, that if the Pakistanis respond
                            positively, you will be asked to execute a Finding that would authorize
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to implement the most feasible

                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Vice President’s views:</hi> The Vice President opened
                        the meeting with a brief discussion of the situation in Afghanistan,
                        underscoring the problems the Soviets are encountering there and the
                        concerted effort they are making to obfuscate them and shift blame onto the
                        United States. He stressed the need to defend our interests and commitments
                        in this part of the world and expressed the hope that the group <pb n="140" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_140"/>would be forward-leaning in its
                        consideration of proposals for dealing with this problem. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan/Pakistan:</hi> The Vice President then departed
                        and the meeting then turned to a detailed discussion of the problem of
                        providing encouragement or aid for insurgency in Afghanistan. It was agreed
                        that this could be done realistically only through and/or with the
                        assistance of the Pakistanis and in the framework of other recent high-level
                        policy decisions on Pakistan. After review of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s proposals it was decided that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> would have early exploratory talks with Pakistani
                        intelligence officials about</p>
                    <p>• radio broadcasts to Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>• financial assistance for selected insurgent groups</p>
                    <p>• an effort to assess the insurgent movement from the viewpoint of providing
                        training and material assistance.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that a Presidential Finding will be required to cover such
                        activity and, unless there is a negative response from the Pakistanis, such
                        a Finding will be forwarded to the President and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> will be authorized to proceed with the task of working out
                        operations in these fields in cooperation with the Pakistanis.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">An unknown hand underlined “unless there is a negative
                            response,” and placed a question mark in the left margin next to the
                            sentence.</note> If the Pakistani response to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s exploratory talks is negative, the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> will reconvene and review the issues anew.

                        issue provides a good opportunity for us here. We have the Russians deeply
                        involved in the internal affairs of another country and they are obviously
                        trying to mask it with counterattacks to put us on the defensive. They are
                        supporting a highly unpopular government in Afghanistan; secondly, they are
                        fighting the world of Islam. It is embarrassing to them. It would be nice
                        for us to be seen on the other side. I have been encouraging us to make that
                        point wherever we can. The State Department had made a good statement on it.
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC_1">Pell</persName> did a statement on it.
                        We have talked with <persName corresp="#p_ZCJ_1">Zablocki</persName> and
                        others and they will be making statements. I think we ought to keep the heat
                        on this. The Russians are jumpy as hell about this. I gather when we say we
                        are not involved that that is accurate. Are the Egyptians and the Pakistanis
                        involved?</p>
                    <p>FC: We have no evidence that they are; but they cannot control the
                        border.</p>

                        The Pakistanis are not involved except that the insurgency started in three
                        areas across the frontier from Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>WS: They do not want to get too involved because they are afraid the Russians
                        will step on them.</p>

                        in the light of your helpful comments. We are sorry you have to leave
                        now.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: In view of the Vice President’s
                        comments—which are shared by the President—let us go first to the action
                        proposals for Afghanistan. We have all read Stan’s paper—the proposals all
                        involve either some assistance to the Pakistanis or direct financial aid to
                        the insurgents (read summary of proposals). Let’s consider <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s options. We have already spent a lot of
                        time discussing covert assistance to the Afghans. We are aware that a major
                        insurgency is in progress. It is in our national interest that this
                        insurgency continue even if it does not succeed. The question is whether any
                        one of these steps would be helpful. We do not have a national policy that
                        covert activity is to be abandoned. We have a national policy that covert
                        activity should be undertaken when it is warranted.</p>
                    <p>ST: I want to make the point that covert actions will not turn the tide but
                        they could help sustain insurgency there. Whether we are going to overturn
                        the government or not should not be the main question. This program has to
                        be accompanied by a strong policy of support for Pakistan. Unless the
                        Pakistanis feel we are going to live up to the 1959 treaty, they are not
                        going to cooperate with us. Radio broadcasts are totally dependent upon
                        them. We could not do them without their support . . .</p>
                    <p>GB: Why can’t you just bring a ship up and do them from it?</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: We can do only the smallest amount of
                        support for the guerrillas without cooperation with the Pakistanis. I am
                        concerned if we try to get sites for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] we have to relate these actions to other things we
                        do—it is almost bound to leak. We are going to have to give a degree of
                        guarantee to the Pakistanis in any case. This issue is really a State
                        Department issue—how far we are willing to go in giving the Pakistanis
                        support for the cooperation they give <pb n="142" facs="0187" xml:id="pg_142"/>us. Then there is the nuclear problem and a lot of
                        other issues with them.<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">See <ref target="#d42fn4">footnote 4, Document 42</ref>.</note> I do not know how to sort it
                        out. In a different context we have settled on a 4-pronged approach to
                        Pakistan which is in the process of being implemented by the Department of
                        State. One element of that involves reiteration of our commitment of the
                        late 1950’s without permitting the Pakistanis to engage in hypothetical
                        exercises as to what we might do under certain contingencies. We are trying
                        insofar as possible to separate contentious issues from issues where we have
                        a common interest—one of these being preservation of the countries to the
                        south of the Soviet Union in this part of the world and expressing sympathy
                        for the insurgency in Afghanistan. The question is whether any of these
                        proposed activities would further our policy regarding Pakistan and whether
                        it would have the effect of complicating the takeover of Afghanistan
                        itself—not to speak, perhaps, of the ultimate objective which would be to
                        reverse the takeover and keep the situation boiling the way that they (the
                        Soviets) have kept it boiling for us in other parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>DN: I would like to raise a more general question. Right now there is an
                        active insurgency going on in Afghanistan. All indications are that the
                        Pakistanis want to maintain a posture that they are now [<hi rend="italic">not</hi>] involved. If we go ahead with anything that requires a
                        Presidential Finding and reporting to seven committees under Hughes-Ryan
                        procedures, we are running a risk.<note n="5" xml:id="d48fn5">A reference to
                            procedures required by an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of
                            1974. Also called the Hughes-Ryan Amendment after its co-authors Harold
                            E. Hughes (D–Iowa) and Leo Ryan (D–California), the legislation
                            obligated the President to find that a particular covert action was
                            important to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> national security. The
                            finding and “a description and scope of such operation” must be
                            submitted “to the appropriate committees of the Congress” in “a timely

                            1795)</note> The American role is likely to come out—knowledge of the
                        American role could change the prospects as far as the Soviets are
                        concerned. They could react differently. I want to raise this question, for
                        we run the risk of upsetting the Soviets if we undertake these covert
                        activities.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: That risk is there and its implication is
                        that we should not undertake covert activity at all.</p>
                    <p>GB: Then we would be out of business.</p>
                    <p>FC: There is considerable concern on the Hill about just that point now.
                        Congress has raised it with us. They say they intend for us to engage in
                        covert action and they feel that they need to do something about cutting
                        down access to sensitive information to minimize the chances of leaks. In a
                        recent <gloss target="#t_SSCI_1">SSCI</gloss> meeting I was asked why we in
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> were not doing something in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><pb n="143" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_143"/>GB: I believe we should change the
                        law only to report through the select committees on intelligence. I bet we
                        can do that.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: I was on a plane with Chuck Percy the
                        other day—he told me that if we wish to do serious covert activities, the
                        Senate will give us overwhelming support now. The way to get going is to
                        pick a place and to try to do it.</p>
                    <p>GB: We have to put pressure on the intelligence committees to control the
                        leaks.</p>
                    <p>FC: I think they are in a mood to do it. That does not meet our immediate
                        problem, however. The law still requires us to brief seven committees.</p>
                    <p>DN: If what is going on is already causing real problems for the Soviets in
                        Afghanistan, what additional benefit do we gain by getting involved in it
                        ourselves? Especially if we run the risk of having what we are doing leaked
                        and thus changing real perceptions in Moscow?</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Another question that can be asked—if the
                        insurgency is not doing well, why help it? But you then come up again with
                        the conclusion that if you don’t do it, you lose an opportunity. You have an
                        important point re Pakistan. My inclination would be to pick from this list
                        those actions that we would only undertake with Pakistan if they are willing
                        to cooperate. If they are not willing to cooperate, we do not do it. I would
                        be inclined to go for the radio broadcasts. This is an important mechanism
                        for influencing political conduct. This can only be done together with the
                        Pakistanis. Then we could consider some financial aid and send in a survey
                        team to examine on-site possibilities for other forms of support—all of
                        these actions would require cooperation with the Pakistani intelligence
                        services. If they come back and say no—then we have to reconsider.</p>
                    <p>DN: There is one other avenue—through the Saudis and through the emigre
                        groups if the Saudis will provide funds.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Would you be willing to do that without
                        telling the Pakistanis?</p>
                    <p>DN: No.</p>
                    <p>GB: My feeling after reading this was that we should do whatever we can
                        without involving the Pakistanis so that they can say they know nothing
                        about what is going on.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Is that possible?</p>
                    <p>ST: We feel that we could only do a little of this and then we would have to
                        tell the Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: This brings us back to <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David Newsom</persName>’s point—there may be a leak.
                        If it is a leak about something we are doing without the knowledge of the
                        Pakistanis, then we have a greater problem with them in case of a leak . .
                        .</p>
                    <p><pb n="144" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_144"/>FC: They have already given us some
                        indications they want to do something.</p>
                    <p>GB: Then I withdraw my observations.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: What about the package I have
                        suggested?</p>
                    <p>ST: It will take a survey before we can give financial aid to anybody.</p>
                    <p>DN: You have to do the survey before you can make a precise recommendation on
                        financial support?</p>
                    <p>FC: We can engage the Pakistanis in discussion of financial support for
                        dissident groups and then channel the support with their knowledge.</p>
                    <p>DN: When do we have to make the Presidential Finding?</p>
                    <p>FC: I strongly recommend that we make a Finding first.</p>

                    <p>GB: You can talk to them without making a finding.</p>
                    <p>FC: But that would confront us with the problem of arousing expectations that
                        we could not meet. We would feel a lot better having these discussions after
                        having a Finding.</p>
                    <p>GB: If you do that, it may leak and then we don’t have the chance to do
                        it.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Can we have a Finding by the President
                        and then not do it?</p>
                    <p>FC: We have to inform the Congress in a timely manner.</p>
                    <p>GB: You don’t have to tell the Congress until you do it.</p>
                    <p>ST: You can have the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> approve the finding
                        and not have the President sign it.</p>
                    <p>FC: Our people in the field want to have some blessing before they talk about
                        this sort of thing with the people they are dealing with.</p>
                    <p>GB: If the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> authorizes you to negotiate
                        that is enough—if they say that they don’t want to do that—how will we then
                        unravel this thing that we have started?</p>
                    <p>FC: If the position of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> is clear that
                        if we negotiate and the Pakistanis are interested, then we will get finding
                        and go ahead, then we can do it.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Is that possible, Griffin?</p>

                    <p>ST: I fear we may have confused this in the way we have presented it. Unless
                        we find out what is really going on in Afghanistan and among these
                        insurgents, any money we give to the Pakistanis could simply go down the

                    <p>ST: You say he is trying to influence the Pakistanis to take a more forward
                        position. This gets to be a very fine line . . .</p>
                    <p>DN: How would you describe the survey team and its proposals in your report
                        to the Congress?</p>
                    <p>FC: “Survey team” is too formal a description. We might step up our

                        group of people together to do this.</p>
                    <p>GB: I suggest you drop the word “Survey team” and say you are going to assess

                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: That is highly desirable. We could be

                    <p>RJayne: I am worried that the Pakistanis may simply tell us to buzz off. If
                        that is the case, we ought to amend the three items so that we can consider

                    <p><gloss target="#t_ZB_1">ZB</gloss>: Yes, but in that case we would have to
                        reassess what we might try. I am not against covert action, but it has to
                        have some relationship to foreign policy in general or it makes no
                        sense.</p>

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. During a meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>, April 11, the Secretary made the following
                        démarche concerning Soviet accusations of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support for the insurgency in Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">The meeting was summarized in telegram 91469 to Moscow,
                            April 12. Regarding Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> protested recent Soviet propaganda alleging <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement and asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> if such propaganda
                            foreshadowed Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet Ambassador
                            denied Soviet intentions to intervene and countered that the Voice of
                            America had broadcast “hostile content” to the Soviet Union. (National
                            Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy

                    <p>3. The Secretary made the following points:</p>
                    <p>—The United States is not interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan
                        and is in no way responsible for the current unrest in that <pb n="147" facs="0192" xml:id="pg_147"/>country. This was made clear to the Soviet
                        Government in repeated <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> public
                        statements and in a private démarche delivered by our Embassy to the Foreign
                        Ministry in Moscow.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">Instructions and talking
                            points for the démarche were sent in telegram 69537 to Moscow, March 21.

                            Foreign Policy File, P840148–2586) The Embassy delivered the démarche
                            the same day. (Telegram 6958 from Moscow, March 21; National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            P840148–2589) The Department issued public statements denying
                            involvement in Afghanistan on March 23 and April 2. (Stuart Auerbach,
                                “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Cautions Soviets on
                            Interfering in Afghanistan,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>,
                            March 24, 1979, p. A12; and Don Oberdorfer, “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Blasts ‘Baseless’ Soviet Charges,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, April 3, 1979, p. A12)</note></p>
                    <p>—At the same time, the United States has made clear that we categorically
                        reject the baseless allegations made by Soviet media of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement in Afghanistan’s internal
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>—Despite this, accusations continue to appear in Soviet media. Given similar
                        statements by high Soviet officials we assume these media reports are
                        inspired by the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p>—One particularly objectionable example was the April 10 <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article by one A. Petrov. This article makes unfounded
                        allegations against Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren
                            Christopher</persName> and purports to give the names of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> experts in subversive activity.</p>
                    <p>—These reports that the United States is responsible for anti-government
                        activity by various Afghan groups are completely false and do not serve the
                        interests of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations or
                        stability in an unsettled area of the world.</p>
                    <p>—Our two countries can surely agree that the present period is characterized
                        by various tensions and instability in South Asia and the Persian Gulf. Our
                        respective interests should be directed toward insuring peace and stability
                        in these troubled regions, and we believe that an important step in this
                        direction is the avoidance of provocative recriminations and unfounded
                        allegations of outside interference.</p>
                    <p>—Continued untrue accusations of involvement of the United States can affect
                        the safety of American citizens in Afghanistan. Moreover, steps which
                        inflame regional tensions can lead governments of the region to call for
                        greater involvement of both our countries, a development which would make
                        the instability of the area more dangerous to international peace and
                        security.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">The widespread insurgencies in Afghanistan continue to
                            erode the loyalty of the armed forces—the main prop for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s regime. Tribal
                            rebels lack the strength and organization to confront the
                            Soviet-supported Army outside their home areas, however, and by
                            themselves have little prospect of overthrowing the government. Unrest
                            in the cities and more settled areas may pose a more difficult problem
                            for the regime.</hi> ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>Muslim tribesmen along the Pakistani border took up arms almost immediately
                        after the military coup a year ago that brought the Marxists to power in
                        Kabul. Since then, many additional tribal groups, motivated mainly by
                        religious sentiments, have instigated rebellions in their native areas. A
                        government crackdown last winter against Muslim clergymen critical of the
                        regime gave new impetus to the unrest. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The insurgencies seem to be gaining momentum, and the government’s authority
                        is now being contested to some degree in nearly every province. Along much
                        of the eastern border with Pakistan, government control is limited to major
                        towns and main roads. Rebel sources report that two towns in this
                        region—Chiga Serai and Asmar—are surrounded and will soon fall. Farther
                        west, rebels this week seized control of Arjestan and killed the district
                        governor. Fighting continues near Mazar-i-Sharif in the north-central region
                        and also in the northwest, where rebels control one large area along the
                        Soviet border. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling

                    <p>The Afghan Government has been forced to redeploy most of its available
                        troops from the capital toward the Pakistani border. More than two-thirds of
                        the Army’s infantry regiments are in the east, leaving few units available
                        for deploying elsewhere. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines, classification marking,

                    <p>There is little cooperation among the various rebel groups operating in
                        Afghanistan’s tribal areas. Along the Pakistani border, however, there has
                        been limited cooperation between neighboring tribes, [<hi rend="italic">2

                    <p>Coordination is better among the exile groups in Pakistan, but despite an
                        announcement on 11 March that the three most important factions would
                        cooperate, there has been little indication that they are actually working
                        together. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling

                    <p>The tribal rebels alone have little immediate prospect of overthrowing the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> government. The tribes
                        can hold their own in the mountains and may even win minor victories against
                        the government, but they have little chance of capturing a major city or
                        waging a successful campaign outside the tribal areas. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The government was confronted with a different and more threatening challenge
                        in western Afghanistan last month when mobs, aided by personnel from the
                        local military garrison, took over parts of Herat, the country’s third
                        largest city. After several days, reinforced government troops regained
                        control of the city, but not the surrounding areas. This appears to have
                        been a largely spontaneous uprising not directly related to the tribal
                        insurgencies. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In the cities and those rural areas where the government has traditionally
                        maintained control, the people have fewer arms and are more poorly organized
                        than the tribesmen. Popular unrest could again erupt into rioting as it did
                        in Herat, but sustained resistance will depend on the refusal of government
                        troops to oppose the rebels. A few organizations—such as the Muslim
                        Brotherhood—may still be able to stage isolated terrorist acts in the
                        cities. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Support</p>
                    <p>Foreign backing for the insurgents is limited. Exile groups in Pakistan
                        claim—and probably have received—some support from Saudi Arabia. They also
                        assert that China has offered them arms. This cannot be confirmed. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Pakistan has permitted Afghan exiles, Pakistani religious organizations, and
                        tribesmen to funnel some help to the Afghan tribes. There is little
                        Islamabad could do to prevent Pakistani tribesmen from assisting their
                        Afghan neighbors across the very porous border, and it is not inclined to
                        try. The evidence, however, suggests no significant Pakistani military
                        support for the rebels. Occasionally, when exile groups have been too open
                        in their activities, the government has <pb n="150" facs="0195" xml:id="pg_150"/>asked them to stop.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">In

                            Paktia. The Embassy further noted that the charge, delivered during a
                            high-level Soviet military visit to Kabul, suggested both Soviet
                            endorsement and a “considerable escalation of the propaganda war” that
                            Afghanistan was waging against its neighbors. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                        for the insurgents. Even clandestine help to the rebels has been limited by
                        fear of Soviet retaliation and of provoking much greater and more open

                        and the slim prospects for an early end to insurgency have already seriously
                        damaged morale in the Afghan Army. Purges of suspected disloyal officers

                        begun recalling individuals released from active duty. The Army also is
                        using tribal irregulars to fight other tribes opposing the government. Kabul
                        is undertaking a longer term program to improve command and control in the
                        eastern provinces and to expand the Army as a whole. None of these measures,
                        however, will have any immediate impact on the military’s ability to cope
                        with the insurgency. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling

                        eventually become so severe that officers who now appear loyal would
                        advocate the overthrow of the Marxist regime. Both Kabul and Moscow are
                        attempting to meet this danger. Further purges, more Soviet advisers and
                        arms, strengthening the Army, and gestures such as the recent appointment of
                        a popular officer as Defense Minister may help. At the same time, these
                        remedies could intensify the problems in the military by increasing distrust
                        of Soviet intentions, forcing the government to rely even more on
                        inexperienced officers, and further revealing the government’s weakness.

                        personnel could also become more involved in the fighting in the hinterlands

                    <p>1. At the 6 April 1979 meeting of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>,
                        it was concluded that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> should explore
                        with the Government of Pakistan (<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>)
                        provisions of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> financial and material
                        aid to Afghan insurgents as well as the feasibility of radio broadcasts into
                            Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">See <ref target="#d48">Document
                                48</ref>.</note> The following is a status report on the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> response to this tasking: (S)</p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Discussions with <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss></hi>. From the two discussions we had with Pakistan
                        liaison, after an initial delay on their part, it is apparent that the
                        matter of aid to the Afghan insurgents has become increasingly politicized.
                        (See attachment for a detailed report on our liaison discussions to
                            date.)<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">Attached but not printed. The attached
                            memorandum reported on two meetings the Chief of Station in Islamabad
                            had with <gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss> Director Major General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RKM_1">Mohammad Riaz Khan</persName> and
                                <gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss> Deputy Director Brigadier
                            General Kamal Rabbani. At the first meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RKM_1">Riaz</persName> proposed that the United States
                            fund Pakistan’s procurement and distribution of medical supplies to
                            Afghan rebels and provide non-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-made
                            small arms and ammunition to be distributed to the rebels. The supplies
                            would go to Pathan tribesmen on the Pakistani side of the border who
                            were supporting the rebels based on the Afghan side of the border. The
                            second meeting effectively froze these propositions; in light of Soviet
                            and Afghan charges of Pakistani involvement in the Afghan rebellion,
                                <gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss> had become wary of commencing
                            direct support. Additionally, Rabbani disclosed that the tribesmen
                            “could not be disciplined to keep quiet about outside aid,” and that in
                            any case, the Afghan Government had sufficiently penetrated the rebel
                            groups so that it would learn the source of the aid.</note> This
                        perception is based in part on comments by <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> liaison that Pakistan would not risk acting against
                        Afghanistan without firm <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> backing. Also,
                        at the request of liaison, our discussions with them are now in a “pause”
                        status while they review the situation. We suspect that General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> is orchestrating this slowdown awaiting
                        developments in his ongoing talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>. If we <pb n="153" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_153"/>have not heard from liaison by 26 April, we will take
                        the initiative again and request a meeting. (S)</p>

                        from us to purchase ammunition from unidentified sources in Pakistan. We
                        advised him that we had no policy authority to grant his request.<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> drew

                        lead time for acquiring broadcast equipment cast doubts on this option. We
                        believe, however, that radio services such as [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines

                        appropriate, to initiate psychological operations against the Soviet
                        presence in Afghanistan. The activities which this officer will discuss in
                        the field include: distribution of anti-Soviet propaganda leaflets;
                        production and distribution of cassette tapes; development of spokesmen to
                        project the dissident message effectively; means of getting that message to

                        we have obtained media placements in 25 countries and have provided liaison
                        and agent of influence assets with tailored briefings in 51 countries. Some

                        black documents designed to support and enhance the already ongoing gray
                        propaganda program. The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting of 6
                        April, however, directed us to develop plans for interfering in Afghanistan,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting of 6 March had already
                        endorsed “internal propaganda.”<note n="6" xml:id="d51fn6">See <ref target="#d38fn5">footnote 5, Document 38</ref>.</note> This activity
                        has policy approval under the General Finding on “Soviet Interference in
                        Other Countries’ Affairs.” The Department of Justice, however, has ruled
                        that we had to obtain cleared guidelines on a black program from State, as
                        black operations had not been covered specifically in the relevant
                        “Perspectives.” Unfortunately, attempts to obtain such cleared guidelines
                        have been rebuffed. State takes the position that black operations by
                        themselves would have little impact. This argument fails to take into
                        account our gray program, which black operations will complement and
                        reinforce, as well as the propaganda warfare by leaflet and “night letter”
                        already being waged by the dissidents. (We would expect that our black ops
                        would be picked up and exploited fully by the dissidents.) State also argues
                        that since the Soviets might assume the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                    <p>The Chairman summarized previous discussions on aid to Afghanistan dissidents
                        and recalled that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had been approved to
                        undertake a probe to determine what support to the dissidents was feasible.
                        He called on the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> to summarize. (S)</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> stated that ties with Afghanistan
                        dissident leaders had been established in Pakistan. It is <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s judgment that monetary support for food,
                        clothing, and medical supplies is critical if opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime is to be sustained
                        throughout the winter. Pakistani <pb n="156" facs="0201" xml:id="pg_156"/>support to the dissidents appears to be tailing off. The <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> stated that a modest amount of aid can be
                        funneled directly to Afghanistan dissident leaders in Pakistan. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Discussion ensued as to how the money would be handed out and spent. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> responded that the money would be doled
                        out incrementally and that accountings would be sought and impact and
                        feedback would be looked for. All the goods (food, medical supplies, and
                        clothing) are to be purchased in Pakistan. (S)</p>
                    <p>Turning to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> option 1, the <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> stated that the [<hi rend="italic">less

                        a strong signal into Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Attached but

                            Operations,” called first for approval to “establish an international
                            ’Voice of Free Afghanistan’ radio capability for the insurgents from a
                            third country,” noting that Afghan insurgents needed “regular and
                            dependable” radio access to the general population, which was 90 percent
                            illiterate. The erection of a transmitter facility was estimated to take
                            18 to 24 months at a cost of [<hi rend="italic">amount not
                                declassified</hi>] per annum, and with adequate deniability for the
                            United States. Second, Option 1 called for approval to “assist the
                            insurgents to expand and distribute their recorded and printed
                            propaganda,” at a cost of [<hi rend="italic">amount not
                                declassified</hi>] and with minimal risk of linking the program to
                            the United States.</note> The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> probe
                        had reached the conclusions that Afghanistan language broadcasts to the
                        largely illiterate insurgents would provide a rallying point now lacking.
                        The broadcasts would soon be attributed to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] and would appear to be commercially
                        purchased time on the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] broadcast. Broadcast tapes would be made in the
                        United States and shipped to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] for playing. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] have not yet been sounded out as to their
                        willingness to participate in this effort. (S)</p>
                    <p>Following discussion a consensus emerged to take the following steps:</p>
                    <table cols="2">
                        <row>

                            <cell>To approve Option 2, spending at first the [<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] now in the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> budget [<hi rend="italic">less
                                    than 1 line not declassified</hi>] as necessary.<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">Attached but not printed at Tab C. Option 2,
                                    entitled “Material Support,” called for “cash payments to the
                                    insurgents,” arguing that cash support might not be as efficient
                                    as food and material distribution, “but it should enable them to
                                    survive the approaching winter and maintain the momentum of
                                    their struggle.” The paper further noted that the funds would be
                                    used by rebels to ensure tribal loyalties, and that
                                    “accountability may be difficult, but it is judged that most of
                                    the funds will be expended for needed supplies.” At a projected
                                    cost of [<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>], the
                                    option predicted moderate risk of linking cash payments to the
                                    United States, given that it was likely the Pakistanis would
                                    learn of the program. Pakistan might “overlook” the program,
                                    given the “variety of individuals and countries who have been
                                    approached for funds by the insurgents and who might locally be
                                    the source of financial support.” Finally, the paper surmised an
                                    element of deniability because all non-lethal goods “could be
                                    rationalized on humanitarian grounds.”</note> It was agreed that
                                the Pakistan government would be informed of our support to the
                                Afghan dissidents but that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>

                                    4, entitled “Humanitarian Support,” called for approval to use

                                    the insurgents.” The paper proposed that countries such as Saudi
                                    Arabia, Oman, or Egypt might act in such a capacity, given that
                                    “politically, this may be more acceptable to Pakistan than
                                    becoming directly involved with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in insurgent support.” On the other hand,

                                    would be reduced” with participation of a third country, “which
                                    may intimate the ultimate source of such support to the
                                    Pakistanis,” which could in turn result in complications that
                                    might deprive the Afghan insurgents of support in the time frame
                                    they required. At a cost of [<hi rend="italic">amount not
                                        declassified</hi>] (divided among medical supplies, food,
                                    clothing, transportation, and cash to insurgent leaders), the
                                    option posed moderate risk of linking the United States to the
                                    program. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> might take notice of such
                                    involvement, but if not, Soviet reaction would be minimal and
                                    Pakistan “would be able to maintain deniability.” Option 5, also
                                    entitled “Humanitarian Support,” called for approval to “provide
                                    humanitarian supplies to the insurgents through the Government
                                    of Pakistan.” The objective and cost were identical to Option 4,
                                    while the projected risk of Option 5 was slightly lower, and if
                                    Pakistan agreed to act as a conduit to the insurgents “this
                                    option would likely be the most efficient means of providing
                                    such support.” Option 6, attached but not printed at Tab G, was
                                    not discussed at the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                                    meeting. It called for approval “to provide limited military
                                    supplies to the insurgents through the Government of Pakistan,”
                                    at a cost of [<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>]
                                    and with moderate to high risk of exposure.</note> (S)</cell>

                            leadership as despotic and subservient to the Soviet Union” and to

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>The localized tribal fighting that erupted in the eastern provinces when the
                        pro-Soviet coup group seized power in late April 1978 has since grown into a
                        countrywide insurgency. Faced with the hostility of the devoutly Muslim and
                        traditionally independent population, the regime of President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has no better than an even chance to
                        complete its second year in power.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> will survive only as long as
                        the loyalty of the military, the security services, and the party remains
                        intact under the heavy pressure being brought to bear by hostile forces. The
                        prevailing instability portends a highly fluid political situation in the
                        next 12 months. A number of outcomes are possible.</p>
                    <p>The most likely successor regime would be led by, or at least have the
                        backing of, leftist military officers, who are now considered loyal but who
                        might become disaffected. Coup plotters might seek Moscow’s tacit approval
                        to seize power and in any case would retain strong ties with the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Despite the loss to the insurgents of more than half of the country, the
                        government’s control of Kabul, the other major cities, and the main lines of
                        communication equates to political control of the country. Tribal forces,
                        lacking a centralized command and deficient in material support, do not
                        appear capable of challenging the Soviet-equipped army’s control of the main
                        population centers.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents’ prospects would be enhanced if Pakistan were to provide
                        substantial material support, tactical advice, and training. Barring an
                        improvement in the insurgents’ military capabilities, the <pb n="159" facs="0204" xml:id="pg_159"/>outlook is for a prolonged period of
                        inconclusive fighting for control of territory, population centers, and main
                        roads.</p>
                    <p>The beleaguered <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime’s
                        survival has come to depend increasingly, as the insurgency has spread, on
                        Soviet political, military, economic, and technical support. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s nearly total dependence on Moscow
                        has given the Soviets far more say in the Afghan Government’s day-to-day
                        decisionmaking process than they have ever had, but <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> still appears to be setting the
                        main lines of policy.</p>
                    <p>Kabul has closely associated itself politically with Moscow and has adopted
                        foreign policy positions that are virtually indistinguishable from those of
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>In part because it has accorded the Soviet Union patron state status,
                        Afghanistan shows no interest in improving frayed relations with the United
                        States and other Western powers. Relations with its neighbors Pakistan and
                        Iran are poor and could deteriorate further if Kabul comes to believe Tehran
                        and, in particular, Islamabad are giving substantial backing to Afghan
                        insurgents.</p>
                    <p>The regime does not yet face a security situation that might prompt a request
                        to Moscow for the direct intervention of Soviet forces, but such an appeal
                        is conceivable over the next 12 months. The Soviets have an important stake
                        in Afghanistan. They will go to some lengths to protect it, but probably not
                        to the extent of intervening militarily. The Soviets would be deterred by
                        the possibility that their forces would be bogged down indefinitely trying
                        to shore up a discredited regime. Soviet leaders also would have to weigh
                        the regional and international political costs of direct intervention.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might consider other options short
                        of dispatching combat units to protect its interests in specific
                        contingencies. Moscow, for example, might permit more open use of Soviet
                        advisers in ground combat roles to defend Soviet personnel or equipment. If
                        serious fighting broke out in areas adjoining the Soviet border, Soviet
                        leaders might decide to provide increased numbers of tactical ground support
                        aircraft, helicopter gunships, pilots, and advisers on the ground to assist
                        Kabul.</p>

                            to bring about a “radical change” in leadership through an internal

                        we have been hitting them hard in the aftermath of the <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> killing, or perhaps they want us to
                        acquiesce in Soviet establishment of a new government. (S)</p>
                    <p>For starters we decided to move along two tracks:</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> will be deciding on
                        Saturday whether to evacuate dependents. (There are other good reasons to do
                        so beside the German’s <pb n="161" facs="0206" xml:id="pg_161"/>warning.) We
                        will probably accept a positive recommendation from him.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">Saturday was July 21. In telegram 189714 to Moscow and

                        to make a propaganda issue out of the withdrawal of US dependents. He will
                        then determine whether the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss> Ambassador
                        was in fact speaking with the full sanction of the Soviets. He will also
                        convey these points: We do not believe that any cosmetic changes in the
                        Afghan Government will solve the Soviets’ problem; we will not give our
                        blessing to any such government; we believe that a restoration of a truly
                        neutral Afghan Government would be in our mutual interests; and we have no
                        interest in seeing a government in Afghanistan that would pose a threat to
                        legitimate Soviet interests.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> drew a vertical line and a

                            telegram, neither the question of the safety of Americans in Afghanistan
                            nor the information passed by the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>
                            Ambassador arose during the conversation. Safronchuk did acknowledge the
                            possibility that the Soviets would have to deal with a successor regime
                            in the future, but asserted that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> “would not under any circumstances” introduce combat
                            troops to support the Afghan Government. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                    <p>In August 1979, the Central Intelligence Agency issued a number of reports
                        assessing Soviet intentions with regard to Afghanistan and the increasingly
                        precarious position of the Afghan Government. While stopping short of
                        predicting with certitude the ultimate collapse of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime and consequent military intervention by the
                        Soviet Union, intelligence reporting noted two fundamental and interrelated
                        trends: the Afghan Government was weakening in the face of the growing rebel
                        insurgency, and in response the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was
                        steadily increasing its efforts to equip and train the Afghan military in an
                        attempt to contain and ultimately defeat the insurgency.</p>
                    <p>In intelligence memorandum SR M 79–10094, August 1, the Asia Branch of the
                        Regional Analysis Division noted that control of Afghanistan was effectively
                        split: “Anti-government forces control most of the countryside, while the
                        Afghan Army controls the cities and main roads.” Further, the division of
                        control was not necessarily static; the Afghan Army, the memorandum
                        reported, was experiencing high rates of casualties and desertions—a
                        manpower problem exacerbated by political purges of field grade officers
                        from the previous year. The Afghan Air Force was suffering “acute shortages
                        of qualified pilots and maintenance technicians.” The memorandum also
                        observed that the presence of the Soviet military in Afghanistan had “more
                        than doubled” since <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> came to
                        power in 1978. Soviet military advisers numbered between 1,000 and 2,000,
                        and according to a field report by the Chief of Station in Kabul, July 31,
                        the Soviet advisers have “virtually taken command” of the Afghan military
                        units to which they were assigned. Further, the Soviets expanded the
                        military supplies to Afghanistan, including increased shipments of tanks,
                        artillery, and <pb n="163" facs="0208" xml:id="pg_163"/>ammunition. (Central
                        Intelligence Agency, Directorate of Intelligence, Office of Support

                    <p>In an August 2 <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> intelligence memorandum
                        entitled “<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>-Afghanistan: The Case for
                        Soviet Military Intervention,” the Office of Political Analysis (<gloss target="#t_OPA_1">OPA</gloss>) provided an overview of the factors that
                        could compel the Soviet leadership to send troops into Afghanistan. In light
                        of the trends noted in the August 1 memorandum (above), and the fact that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had already appealed to
                        Moscow “for more direct military involvement,” the memorandum asserted
                        “there would be strong arguments for those Soviet leaders inclined to more
                        forceful measures to prevent an anti-Soviet government from coming to power
                        on their southern flank.” The memorandum noted the strategic and
                        psychological ramifications the “loss” of Afghanistan would have for the
                        Soviet Union, especially in light of its recent inability to prevent the
                        Chinese invasion of Vietnam. Additionally, those arguing for intervention
                        might see the political and economic liabilities of such an operation as
                        manageable, given Afghanistan’s close proximity to the Soviet Union and the
                        fact that Afghanistan’s neighbors, Iran and Pakistan, were already
                        anti-Soviet. <gloss target="#t_OPA_1">OPA</gloss> went on to lay out a
                        number of events that could lead to Soviet intervention. These included:
                        rescue operations of Soviet personnel whose large presence itself already
                        constituted a form of military intervention; tribal violence that embroiled
                        nationality groups on either side of the Soviet-Afghan border; “significant
                        increase in third party assistance” to the rebels from countries such as
                        Pakistan or Iran; and a “serious threat” of rebels overtaking a major urban
                        area such as Kabul. The memorandum concluded with an assessment of the
                        varying degrees of intensity a Soviet intervention could take, ranging from
                        limited operations involving air raids and tank units securing the
                        Soviet-Afghan border, to a “full-fledged intervention” requiring military
                        occupation of strategic areas throughout the country. The latter option, the
                        memorandum asserted, would amount to a “last-ditch Soviet effort” to prevent
                        the fall of the Afghan Government and one that would be complicated by
                        Afghanistan’s rugged terrain and an Islamic population that would mount
                        “intense opposition” to the occupation. (Central Intelligence Agency,
                        National Intelligence Council Files, Job 93T01324R, Box 4, Afghanistan)</p>
                    <p>In a more detailed look at the position and mobility of Soviet military
                        forces in the event of an impending invasion, [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] Chief, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_EE_1">EE</gloss> Branch, noted in intelligence memorandum SR
                        M 79–10100, August 7, that Soviet military advisers currently stationed <pb n="164" facs="0209" xml:id="pg_164"/>in Afghanistan could not, in their
                        present formation, “conduct any significant unilateral operations” because
                        they were lightly equipped and spread thin among all components of the
                        Afghan military. Soviet military intervention would require an influx of
                        troops from inside Soviet territory, with the closest units located in the
                        Turkestan Military District, which housed 45,000 troops with an additional
                        50,000 reserves who could be called up within a week to get the District to
                        wartime strength. Another six divisions were located in the Central Asian
                        Military District but, the memorandum prognosticated, the Soviet leadership
                        would probably be reluctant to redeploy those troops “for fear of weakening
                        their position opposite China.” A faster influx of troops could be
                        accomplished with the Soviet military’s airborne divisions. Airlift of “just
                        one complete airborne division and its support units would, however,
                        severely tax the capacity of the Soviet military transport fleet,” the
                        memorandum noted, and it was unlikely any airlift of troops would be
                        executed without “an eventual linkup of ground forces.” (Central

                    <p>In a memorandum written three days later, August 10, Director of the
                        Strategic Warning Staff <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">Douglas
                            MacEachin</persName> provided the National Intelligence Officer for
                        Warning with three courses of action which the Soviets would likely choose
                        regarding Afghanistan:</p>
                    <quote><p>“a. Continue the present course of providing material support,
                            advisors and technicians, but refrain from committing Soviet combat
                            units (possibly at the same time continuing to seek a political
                            solution).</p>
                        <p>“b. Commit a limited number of Soviet combat forces, sufficient to insure
                            at least the security of Kabul and its immediate area, and perhaps a few
                            other key centers.</p>
                        <p>“c. Commit large combat forces for the purpose of inflicting major
                            military defeats on the insurgent forces and recapturing much of the
                            territory now in rebel hands.”</p></quote>
                    <p>Speaking on behalf of “most other community analysts,” <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">MacEachin</persName> asserted that the third option
                        was the least desirable for the Soviets, given the military and political
                        challenges it would create. Instead, <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">MacEachin</persName> predicted with “strong likelihood” that the
                        Soviets would undertake option b, “and probably in the near future.” Without
                        a limited intervention, <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">MacEachin</persName>
                        reasoned, the “<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> faces the likelihood
                        of being forced to evacuate its mission from Afghanistan,” a development the
                        Soviets would view as worse than any costs associated with limited military
                        intervention. <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">MacEachin</persName> saw the
                        beginnings of a trap: “once having undertaken the increase in their military
                        ante, however, the Soviets are likely to find themselves being drawn into
                        the larger operation despite whatever resolve they might have to avoid it.”
                        Although <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">MacEachin</persName> specified that the
                        intelligence community had <pb n="165" facs="0210" xml:id="pg_165"/>no
                        “concrete evidence” that the Soviets had already decided on even a limited
                        intervention, the evidence was, in his view, sufficiently strong to issue an
                        alert memorandum, a vehicle by which the intelligence community intended to
                        warn policymakers in advance of an intervention, rather than a report on a
                        fait accompli. <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">MacEachin</persName> based his
                        argument on the fact that the Soviet military posture in Afghanistan
                        “already has gone about as far as it can short of direct action by Soviet
                        combat units,” and that the Soviets viewed some form of intervention,
                        without which the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime
                        would fall, as the “least bad” option. (Central Intelligence Agency,

                    <p>A more historically focused memorandum, drafted August 10 by H.C. Cochran of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s Strategic Warning Staff, examined
                        the choices the Soviet Union faced in light of Soviet policy toward
                        Afghanistan since tsarist times. Russia’s longstanding interest in exerting
                        control in Afghanistan, coupled with its proximity to Soviet territory, and
                        the socialist revolution in April 1978, made Afghanistan a “special case” in
                        the minds of Soviet leaders, who ranked its priority well above the
                        importance they attached to supporting “liberation movements” elsewhere in
                        the Third World. Together, these factors “would seem to rule out the
                        theoretical option of Soviet withdrawal and cutting of losses,” particularly
                        because the Soviet leadership believed that a successor government to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime would inevitably
                        be composed of Muslim “counterrevolutionaries,” allied with Iran and
                        Pakistan and hostile to the Soviet Union. Cochran argued that from Moscow’s
                        vantage point, the situation was both high stakes and lacked any
                        satisfactory low-risk options, presenting “Moscow with one of the most
                        difficult foreign policy decisions since the Cuban missile crisis.” Further,
                        the memorandum observed, the hesitancy the Soviet Union displayed in its
                        Afghan policy over the past several months represented a “delayed
                        recognition that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had seriously
                        miscalculated the strength of the forces opposed to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime.” Cochran concluded by
                        noting that the Soviets might still continue to consider all options, but
                        the impending collapse of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        regime—which Cochran calculated would come by the month’s end—would
                        effectively preclude any non-military options the Soviets would consider, no
                        matter the diplomatic and economic consequences. (Central Intelligence

                    <p>The Office of Political Analysis and the Soviet Branch of the Regional
                        Analysis Division each produced memoranda on Soviet options in Afghanistan
                        dated August 17. The <gloss target="#t_OPA_1">OPA</gloss> memorandum, PA M
                        79–10378C, noted that despite significant successes mounted thus <pb n="166" facs="0211" xml:id="pg_166"/>far by insurgent groups, their capacity to
                        challenge the Afghan Government remained limited: rebels had “been unable to
                        take and hold any major town;” they had no means of procuring arms beyond
                        “gun dealers” in Pakistan and whatever they could capture from the Afghan
                        Army; and rebel groups were driven more by provincial desires to rid their
                        territory of government influence than a unifying, countrywide effort to
                        topple the Kabul regime. Still, the memorandum noted, these limitations did
                        not mean the Afghan Government would be able to survive the insurgency, and
                        in recent months Soviet political efforts to moderate antipathy toward the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government had largely failed:
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> still refused to broaden their
                        political base; leading members of the Parchamist faction were under arrest;
                        and the regime remained unremittingly hostile toward Pakistan despite the
                        Soviet Union’s attempts to mitigate tensions between the two countries.
                        Further, the memorandum noted, while the Soviets “should have sufficient
                        assets to pull off a coup,” it remained unclear to them what kind of
                        successor government would be preferable to their interests, and therefore
                        “they probably see no alternative at present to trying to tough it out with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, even though this option will almost
                        certainly require still deeper Soviet military involvement in Afghanistan.”

                    <p>The second memorandum, SR M 79–10109J, built on <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">Douglas MacEachin</persName>’s proposition that, for all intents and
                        purposes, Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan was already underway.
                        According to intelligence reporting, the memorandum noted, Soviet advisers
                        had: accompanied Afghan patrols on the Pakistan border; operated tanks in
                        fighting against rebels in the eastern provinces; coordinated defense plans
                        of major Afghan cities; and might be flying helicopters in anti-insurgent
                        operations. The various options before the Soviets to intensify its military
                        presence in Afghanistan ranged from incremental increases of Soviet advisers
                        to large-scale deployment of ground and airborne forces. The memorandum
                        concluded with the assertion that the Soviet leaders “almost certainly do
                        not believe” that anything short of the “most massive intervention options”
                        would ensure that the Afghan Government was not overtaken by rebel forces.

                    <p>On August 20, the Office of Political Analysis issued memorandum PA M
                        79–1038C, which raised many of the same points stated in previous memoranda,
                        but argued that a full-scale military operation was not yet a foregone
                        conclusion, contrary to Cochran’s analysis. It noted the possibility that
                        increasingly intensive direct military operations <pb n="167" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_167"/>could provoke widespread defections from the Afghan
                        Army to rebel forces, which in turn would require a full-scale military
                        intervention. While “there is no question that the Soviets could install a
                        regime of their choosing with a massive military intervention,” the
                        memorandum argued, a gutted Afghan Army would require an “open-ended”
                        commitment of regular ground force divisions. Thus, “we see few signs that
                        the Soviets are so wedded to leftist rule in Afghanistan that they will
                        undertake an operation of this magnitude. Their unwillingness to label this
                        regime Communist when its leaders clearly view themselves as such, and their
                        willingness to talk to non-Communist figures from old regimes about
                        participation in a new government suggests they have long been mindful of
                        the possibility that the leftist experiment in Afghanistan will fail.”

                    <p>In a memorandum to Arnold L. Horelick, <gloss target="#t_NIO_1">NIO</gloss>
                        for <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_EE_1">EE</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_NIO_1">NIO</gloss> for Conventional
                        Forces added a military dimension to assumed Soviet considerations that
                        might point away from a full-scale military intervention in Afghanistan:
                        such an operation would “appear to require undertakings, quite unlike the
                        massive armor-heavy thrusts against clearly-defined objectives which have
                        heretofore been the Soviet forte. Seizure of Kabul offers no finality, like
                        that of Berlin, Budapest, or Prague. The Soviet advisors with the Afghan
                        Army have been at it long enough to have reported the frustrations and costs
                        of trying to winkle the will-o’-the-wisp insurgents out of the hills, and to
                        have assessed for Moscow the ephemeral fighting qualities of their Afghan
                        allies.” Even in the event of an “anti-Soviet regime seizing power” in
                        Afghanistan, which might compel such an intervention, it would be unlikely
                        that Soviet planners “would contemplate a swift (large-scale) strike like
                        those into Hungary and Czechoslovakia—nothing much to strike against; no
                        assurance that, having struck, any decisive political or military change in
                        the internal security situation would eventuate; and no threat of external
                        counter-intervention to forestall.” Instead, the memorandum argued, the
                        Soviets would employ “recourse to classic counter-guerilla strategy, <hi rend="italic">tache d’huile</hi>—seizure of Kabul plus other centers
                        which would constitute a minimal Soviet-controlled Afghan polity, creation
                        of a ‘legitimate’ Afghan regime, and retrenchment of the Afghan Army.”

                        both the Afghan Government and the insurgency. For the former, the only
                        positive development was a “non-event” in that “the government had not lost
                        control of any major urban area <pb n="168" facs="0213" xml:id="pg_168"/>during the month.” Still, the cable reported, the insurgents’ tactics had
                        grown more sophisticated, and government forces struggled to control major
                        urban areas and the transportation routes connecting them. Meanwhile, the
                        insurgents confronted the same problem that had plagued their campaigns
                        since 1978: while the government enjoyed loyalty from only about 20 percent
                        of the population, the insurgents could claim even less; and politically,
                        rebel leaders had not unified their forces—a fact, the cable observed, that
                        was “part of the reason this regime survives.” With the coming winter, the
                        cable concluded, the advantage might shift to the Afghan Government, which
                        would take advantage of the inevitable slowdown in insurgent activity to
                        shore up its support among the Afghan people, of whom more “may come to
                        realize that even an odious government is better than none.” (Department of

                    <p>3. August 15, Louis Dupree, American universities field staff/Lahore,
                        requested appointment with <gloss target="#t_ConGen_1">ConGen</gloss> and

                        support but only indirectly, to encourage Saudi Arabia to provide material
                        assistance. Request was duly declined.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> reported that his forces,

                        swelled to 200,000 (cf. Afghan army strength of reportedly up to 100,000).
                            <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> claimed his men now
                        total 90 percent of all rebel fighting contingents. At present, they have

                    <p>5. In contrast, various ultra-conservative religious rebel elements are
                        getting funds. An unidentified Arab recently appeared in Peshawar with $3

                        only minor contributions from abroad. Yet former doing hardly any of
                        fighting.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> said he had recently met
                        with Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName>, “main power” in
                        Saudi Arabia, and had been assured Saudis support <gloss target="#t_NFIRA_1">NFIRA</gloss> over ultra-conservative groups. However, Saudis hesitant
                        to initiate major flow of aid to Front unless <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> indicates latter is its favorite among dissident forces.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> also has met with
                        ex-King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir Shah</persName>, who similarly
                        favors <gloss target="#t_NFIRA_1">NFIRA</gloss>. (Zahir wants to return to
                        Kabul but “not as King”; relatives are more ambitious, <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> said.)</p>
                    <p>7. Both <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> and Dupree emphasized
                        that now was critical period for support for <gloss target="#t_NFIRA_1">NFIRA</gloss>, as liberal vs. ultra-conservative confrontation growing.
                        It was important that former win out because if latter does, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will move into Afghanistan in force.
                        Moscow not willing to stand idly by as a “<persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName>-like” movement takes over Afghanistan and spreads
                        anti-Communist, ultra-conservative Islamic influence into Soviet-Muslim
                        border areas. On other hand, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> might be
                        willing to countenance a “liberal” takeover, returning Afghanistan to status
                        quo ante—nonaligned, with necessary tilt toward traditional friend to north.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> urged that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should move now, indicate preference for
                            <gloss target="#t_NFIRA_1">NFIRA</gloss> and encourage Saudis to make
                        substantial contribution to cause. In this way, Front would be strengthened
                        against ultra-conservatives, and after overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime, Afghanistan would be spared
                        a further war (between liberals and conservatives).</p>

                        Front from east, in coordination with Hazara Shias from mountainous area

                        by Khalqi political commissars. <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> estimates that at present there may not be more than
                        15 Soviet advisors to government military force in area. Latter however

                        concentrated in Kabul area. He described Nooristan as “practically

                        REBELLION (U)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>(C) Afghan tribal and religious leaders have historically resisted government
                        encroachments. Central authority has always been weak in the provinces
                        except when tied to local leaders. With the encouragement and support of
                        dissaffected elements of the ruling elite, serious opposition by traditional
                        forces has invariably resulted in political change in Kabul. Only in 1929,
                        however, did tribal rebels manage to take the capital and then were unable
                        to hold it.</p>
                    <p>([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) The present rebellion began within a month of the
                        April 1978 coup by the leftist Khalqi group. Almost immediate implementation
                        of far-reaching reforms, degradation of Islam, alliance with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and extension of close government
                        control into the lowest levels of society produced strong and steadily
                        escalating opposition in the countryside. The government managed to contain
                        dissent through much of 1978 but not suppress it, largely because of the
                        depth of discontent and its own preoccupation with consolidating the
                        revolution.</p>
                    <p>([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) No distinct pattern of tribal opposition is evident,
                        nor are the numbers of rebels known. Violence has occurred throughout
                        Afghanistan and has involved elements of all five major ethnic groups and
                        many minor ones. The fighting is generally confined to tribal valley
                        homelands. Islam and hatred of the Soviets and godless leftists serve as
                        unifying motives for rebellion, but they are not strong enough to produce a
                        coordinated rebellion. Despite much publicity, calls for a holy war, and
                        inflated claims, most exile groups play a very small role in the fighting or
                        its support.</p>
                    <p>([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) In the past several months rebel forces, aided by
                        army defectors and captured equipment, have demonstrated improved
                        capabilities in some areas and continued to expand the rebellion. Rebels are
                        now able to operate freely in 20 of 28 provinces, and the recent outbreak of
                        serious fighting in three major areas is severely taxing government forces.
                        Nevertheless, without some additional catalyst, such as a military collapse,
                        the rebels lack the capability to remove the regime.</p>
                    <p>([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) The threat to the government stems less from rebel
                        strength than Army weakness. The Army has never been tested in battle nor
                        trained in counterinsurgency. Despite extensive Soviet support and the
                        presence of about 2,000 military advisers, Army capabilities continue to
                        decline. The Army holds only the major towns and provincial capitals, but
                        increasingly it has been unable to secure the roads between them. <pb n="172" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_172"/>Frustrated at fighting a no-win
                        struggle, poorly trained, dependent on tenuous air resupply, and badly
                        overextended, some units have refused to fight. More important, at the
                        recent rate of losses and desertions major units may be unable to maintain
                        organizational integrity and combat effectiveness through the winter.</p>
                    <p>([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) As the government’s power base has narrowed, the
                        Army’s role as the primary national-level stabilizing institution has become
                        critical. Neither non-Khalqi officers nor the Soviet advisers are likely to
                        allow the Army to collapse or be sacrificed. Before such a development, key
                        military units in Kabul are likely to turn on the government. Such a
                        struggle could result in anarchy, and the outcome is far from clear. In the
                        event of a power vacuum in Kabul, a tribe or combination of rebel tribes
                        might seize the capital, but this would only aggravate the bloodshed. In any
                        case, serious violence in Kabul and political change seem almost inevitable
                        and could occur at any time.</p>

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary. I think it very important that those directly concerned with our
                        policy towards Afghanistan read the cable under reference. It is another
                        chilling report about one of our FSNs being tortured. The significance of
                        the incidence however goes well beyond the discomfiture experienced by our
                        employee. It is to that aspect I address this msg. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Our presence in Kabul is, in my view, faced with three perils. The first
                        is, of course, the insurgency and the related possibility of an internal
                        coup, either of which could bring physical harm to members of the small
                        American community.</p>
                    <p>4. The second danger relates to the brutal intimidation being experienced by
                        our FSNs. Nowhere else in the Foreign Service today, I venture, are our
                        locals being subjected to such gross mistreatment by the host govt. The
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> is obviously bent on penetrating
                        this Mission, regardless of human rights considerations, to develop
                        hopefully “proof” of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> subversive
                        activities. In this they are undoubtedly being assisted by the Soviets. The
                        implications of this <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> policy are <pb n="175" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_175"/>worrisome. Not only does it confirm
                        the enmity which <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> has
                        for the United States (the secret police are under his direct control), but
                        it raises a real concern about the safety of our American personnel. As
                        Langley and <gloss target="#t_SY_1">SY</gloss> can confirm, this govt is,
                        quite aside from intimidating our employees, also making an all-out effort
                        to plant listening devices in our residences, and we can only assume they
                        have been successful in many instances. The experience too of the Pakistan
                        Embassy here, wherein its <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> employees
                        have been harassed and one abducted (in somewhat mysterious circumstances)
                        shows that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> is not above ignoring
                        diplomatic immunities and international standards of decency. In sum, I
                        worry that at some point <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName> may arrest one of our American employees, on doctored or
                        circumstantial evidence, in order to “prove” some point of his or hold us
                        hostage.</p>
                    <p>5. Third, we have a nettlesome problem with respect to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s apparent determination to reduce the
                        size of this Mission. This is again, I suspect, related to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>’s semi-psychopathic desire
                        to humiliate and revenge himself against the United States.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">Three days later, the Embassy reported in telegram 6483
                            from Kabul, August 28, that “anti-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            blasts were the order of the day” during the “International Conference
                            of Solidarity with the People of Afghanistan,” sponsored by what the
                            Embassy characterized as the “Communist front” World Peace Council of
                            Helsinki. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> gave the keynote
                            speech on August 24, and the conference proceedings, which were
                            published in the local media and thus suggested official Afghan
                            endorsement, included the charge that “armed intervention from across
                            Afghanistan’s borders is entirely the work of the United States” and
                            there was “no support within Afghanistan for this intervention.”

                            Foreign Policy File, D790392–1083; a copy of the telegram was also found

                        In this msg I do not want to prejudge the outcome, but I am not sanguine we
                        can maintain a Mission of some 45 employees. Needless to say, I do not
                        relish the prospect of presiding over a humiliating, forced reduction of the
                        United States presence by a small and one of the most unsavory govts in the
                        world today.</p>
                    <p>6. Complicating the above scenario is the still unfinished business of who
                        was responsible for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>’s
                        death. I do not want in this msg to get into this subject either, but as the
                            <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss> knows, we continue to get
                        disturbing reports about <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName>’s role in the affair.</p>
                    <p>7. In sum, I send this msg because I am worried about our presence here, not
                        only for the safety of our Americans but for the honor of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                        well, is whether we shouldn’t reduce our <pb n="176" facs="0221" xml:id="pg_176"/>staff further, even at the cost of handicapping our

                    </list>
                    <p>The more over-extended the Soviets feel, the better off we will be and the
                        less likely that they will undertake reckless future action. Afghanistan has
                        all the earmarks of a situation in which the Soviets could become embroiled
                        endlessly. The only thing that is missing is a sense of unity on the part of
                        the opposition.</p>
                    <p>I therefore believe that we would derive great benefits if the various Afghan
                        exiles, together with representatives of the tribal groups doing the actual
                        fighting, could get together and proclaim an Afghan Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ALF_1">ALF</gloss>) analogous to the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>, which was such an effective device for the Vietnamese.
                        Like the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>, the Front could be across a
                        wide spectrum that would include women’s groups, Royalists—even avowed
                        Communists. The stated aim of the <gloss target="#t_ALF_1">ALF</gloss> would
                        be to rally world opinion behind the Afghan freedom fighters’ heroic
                        struggle <pb n="177" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_177"/>against the forceful
                        imposition of an atheistic Soviet regime in their homeland.</p>
                    <p>Like the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>, the Front should establish
                        links to other similar groups and set up offices throughout the world. It
                        should, if handled correctly, receive support from all the Muslims, from
                        Iran, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to Algeria, Libya and Iraq. Not least of all,
                        it would offer many people in the United States and in Western Europe the
                        opportunity to demonstrate their consistency in having opposed us in Viet
                        Nam and in opposing a Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan as well.</p>
                    <p>Because of longstanding rivalry, it will be very difficult to get some of
                        these groups to cooperate with each other. But with a little effort and a
                        lot of money, it might be possible to bring this about. The one thing that
                        should be avoided in an operation of this kind, of course, is the appearance
                        that this is a US undertaking. I would therefore suggest that we approach
                        the Chinese with this idea and determine whether they would be willing to
                        carry the ball and work together with the Pakistanis and perhaps the
                        Iranians to set up such an organization.</p>

                            Soviet leaders may be on the threshold of a decision to commit their own
                            forces to prevent the collapse of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime and protect their sizable stake in
                            Afghanistan. Small Soviet combat units may already have arrived in the
                            country. I am concerned that the Soviets may be underestimating the
                            difficulties of shoring up the regime and may find themselves under
                            growing pressures to escalate the scope of their intervention in the
                            next few months. Moreover, the Soviets may now be more inclined to
                            gamble on a substantial intervention in Afghanistan because of their
                            perception of a downturn in relations with the US and the uncertain

                    <p>As opposition to the Afghan government has increased over the past year, the
                        Soviets have gradually augmented their military advisory presence. Early
                        this year, at least five generals and an estimated 750–1000 military
                        advisors were stationed in the Kabul area, assisting newly promoted officers
                        in the Ministry of Defense and training Afghan recruits. Since then, the
                        Soviet presence has grown to at least 2,500. Moreover, the role of Soviet
                        troops has increasingly changed from a mere advisory one to active
                        participation in and supervision of a wide variety of activity including
                        logistics and combat planning functions as far down as some regimental and
                        battalion-level units. They are apparently heavily involved in guiding
                        Afghan combat operations, as well as logistics and administration. Some
                        unconfirmed reports allege that Soviet helicopter pilots, with Afghan
                        co-pilots, have flown strike missions against the insurgents and that Soviet
                        tank personnel have participated in combat operations. In addition, Soviet
                        advisors have reportedly suffered about 80 casualties. If these reports are
                        true, the Soviets are also actively participating in combat on a small and
                        limited scale with Afghan units. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking

                        information has not been corroborated, but Embassy Kabul has submitted

                        forces by the Soviets would suggest increased security precautions and an
                        escalation of Soviet involvement beyond an advisory role. The Soviets might
                        consider such a move into Kabul to be prudent in view of the uprisings that
                        have occurred in Kabul this year and the continuing <pb n="180" facs="0225" xml:id="pg_180"/>possibility of violence in the capital. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling restriction

                    <p>There appear to be three possibilities:</p>
                    <p>1. The entire sequence over the weekend (dismissal of the military in the

                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s announcement of the end of
                        one-man leadership) was stage-managed by the Soviets as a way of getting a
                        more acceptable government installed in Kabul. This doesn’t seem likely. The
                        Soviets made quite a fuss over <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> last week in Moscow; <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> would have been a much better figurehead for a
                        national front government in Afghanistan; and the Soviets would not seem to
                        have any reason to do in the military faction. This would seem to be the
                        least likely explanation.<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">In telegram 21969 from

                            during which he secured an “authoritative reaffirmation” of the Soviet
                            Union’s commitment to the Afghan “people,” which the telegram noted was
                            vague, as opposed to a more specific commitment to the Afghan

                        would have held out longer in his bluff against the Soviets, and will doubt
                        his vague professions of future collegiality until he starts implementing
                        them. That, however, is only a guess. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>/Codeword)</p>
                    <p>It is hard to see how the Soviets can come out winners no matter which is the
                        case. They tried before to put a national front together and failed,
                        probably because nobody else would play. Why would anybody be more willing
                        to sign on now—unless the Soviets could give credible guarantees that there
                        would be a genuine sharing of power? That doesn’t seem too likely. And,
                        given the growing weakness of the regime, why would anybody want to share
                        power now when they might get the whole thing shortly? (There may be in fact
                        reasons that would impel people to do so, arising perhaps from inter-tribal
                        considerations. But I don’t understand these and know nobody who does.)

                    <p>Most likely, the Soviets have just been pushed a big step nearer to their
                        moment of truth in Afghanistan. In this game of “Ten Little Afghans,” there
                        is now only one left. (S)</p>
                    <p>Whatever the Soviet role in this, they should be made to look as if they had

                        something of a Lenin figure and had a degree of foreign respect. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is the Stalin of the drama and the

                    <p>6978. Subject: Some Reflections on the Afghanistan Political Crisis.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text).</p>
                    <p>2. I think it must be quite evident to the <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss> and addressee posts that we are witnessing a very
                        significant political crisis in Afghanistan. In this regard, I would like to
                        highlight some aspects and share some personal thoughts:</p>
                    <p>—The crisis is not over. At this point in time the loyalty of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> military units in such areas as Ghanzi,
                        Kandahar and Kunduz is not clear, and there are widespread reports (and some
                        evidence) that the three deposed military figures in the Cabinet (<persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GSM_1">Gulabzoi</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MSJ_1">Mazdooryar</persName>) have managed to escape the city and are at
                        large. It is quite possible that civil war among major <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> military units could ensue, led by
                            pro-<persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> or otherwise
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> elements. Here in
                        Kabul, we are very much aware that the political situation remains tense.
                        Major streets adjacent to important ministries remain blocked off to regular
                        traffic, and here at the Chancery, manned Soviet-built tanks are stationed
                        astride the three streets bordering the Embassy property. We can’t enter or
                        exit by the front gate because the street is closed, so we are using our
                        emergency back gate, but do so under the barrel of a large T–62 tank. It is
                        all a bit unnerving, but something certainly to write home to mother
                        about.</p>
                    <p>—For 18 months now we have watched this Marxist party (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) devour itself. An Afghan official last
                        night quietly described the leadership to an Embassy officer as a “bunch of
                        scorpions biting each other to death.” By way of illustration, there have
                        been 25 Cabinet changes since the original list was promulgated in April
                        1978. The number of Deputy Minister changes has been even more: 34. Purge
                        after purge has occurred, and one can’t help wonder how the regime manages
                        to survive. Part of the answer is, of course, brutal suppression of
                        perceived opposition. The number of political prisoners killed may have
                        reached 6,000, and probably more than four times that number have been in
                        and out of political jails.</p>
                    <p><pb n="185" facs="0230" xml:id="pg_185"/>—The insurgency during this crisis
                        period has been inept and quiescent. It has not taken advantage of the
                        political crisis to push its advantage.</p>
                    <p>—I don’t know what the future will bring. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has amazingly survived plot after plot against him.
                        Surely the law of averages should catch up with him someday. But then Stalin
                        died in bed. Personally, I would give him no better odds than 50 per cent to
                        survive in power this calendar year. I give his chances of dying in bed of
                        old age as nil. I would though, lay higher odds that the party itself
                            (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) will survive in control in some
                        form.</p>
                    <p>3. It is an interesting time to be in Kabul. Let’s hope nobody gets hurt.</p>

                    <p><gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff member, <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Tom Thornton</persName>, used a meeting in his office
                        yesterday afternoon to produce a list of options on Afghanistan for the
                        President to consider on Friday morning at the “Breakfast of Champions”—with
                        Zbig and Cy. <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> said the list
                        would not be presented as a cleared agenda of action but as a guide to
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> said that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] it was predicted the Soviets
                        were on the verge of a large scale military intervention which had produced
                        in the White House staff a feeling that intervention would doom <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and strong <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic action would be required to prevent such
                        intervention or try to counter it. <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> proposed to work out options on the basis of what
                        we might do if <pb n="186" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_186"/>such an intervention
                        does not occur and, alternatively, if it does. (See Tab A.)<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">Tab A, a paper dated September 20, is attached but not
                            printed. The paper, organized in two parts, outlined actions the United
                            States could take before and after a Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
                            and called such an action a “watermark event of global import.” The
                            paper emphasized that the United States could not be perceived to be
                            responsible for Afghanistan’s security and that Afghanistan must not be
                            understood as a Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bilateral
                            problem. Prior to a Soviet intervention, the paper argued that the
                            United States should remain in strong consultation with its regional and
                            strategic allies and must raise public consciousness to foster global
                            condemnation of any Soviet moves into Afghanistan. The paper also argued
                            against military assistance to rebel forces in Afghanistan or military
                            moves in the region. Following Soviet intervention, the United States
                            should consider closing down the Embassy in Kabul, complaining to the
                            Soviet leadership that the intervention posed a danger to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relationship, and giving “open
                            assistance to the rebels.”</note></p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_DIA_1">DIA</gloss> is skeptical [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>] that there is a battalion of Soviet
                        airborne already in Kabul, with a full division getting ready to follow.
                            [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] made the point that in
                        the first instance our concern should be with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Thus, while we might want to deplore Soviet presence in
                        Afghanistan, we do not want to create expectations of actions on our part or
                        concessions on the Soviet part if neither was likely to materialize. This
                        could contribute to the defeat of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in
                        the Senate. The other argument [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] was that, notwithstanding the importance and
                        difficulty of our discussions with the Soviets on removal of the Soviet
                        brigade from Cuba, we should not pass up the opportunity to tell them that
                        intervention in Afghanistan could doom the treaty just as surely as
                        continued problems on the brigade in Cuba.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> and others did not accept
                        that we should add the Afghanistan item to our talks with the Soviets

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> met during the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly meeting on
                            September 24 and 27. See <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d226"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. VI, Soviet

                    <p>On the other point, however, a consensus emerged on demarches to regional and
                        other capitals which would avoid overstating our interest, our need to
                        react, and our demands on the Soviets in a way that would box us in with
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> critics here. The demarches are
                        to focus on the—</p>
                    <p>—Soviet-South Asia relationship, not the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relationship.</p>
                    <p>—Possibilities of further expansion of the Soviet role in a civil war in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—In this way we could get the publicity we sought for Soviet action—perhaps
                        inspiring a wide and adverse public and diplomatic <pb n="187" facs="0232" xml:id="pg_187"/>reaction in the Arab world, Iran and the
                        subcontinent—without taking on <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        directly or aligning ourselves with the rebels. This is essentially a
                        non-interventionist view, and most held it to be compatible with our
                        military capabilities, both direct and indirect in the region, and with our
                        limited interests. It means that we will reject the strong suggestion which
                        the Chinese have apparently made to us to provide weapons for the rebels
                        through the Pakistanis. In fact, most parties were cool to the idea that
                        such aid might be useful even if the Soviets do intervene in great force.
                        The State, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> view was that we want to “wring our hands
                        like mad” and “make them pay a price” but not be drawn into the melee inside
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CPD_1">Constable</persName> of State, however, advanced
                        the view that if there was a large scale intervention we would want to:</p>
                    <p>—Deploy forces (tactical air) to Pakistan and accelerate the deployment of a
                        carrier task force to the Arabian Sea.</p>
                    <p>—Condemn Soviet action in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> as a threat to
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>—Consult with the Indians about defense of the Subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>The meeting did not really come to grips with the problem that an enlarged
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in defense of the Subcontinent
                        probably means arms for Pakistan and a reduction, if not end, of our
                        pressures on the Pakistanis in nuclear matters.</p>
                    <p>Also, given our wholly diplomatic posture on the current increased Soviet
                        presence in Afghanistan—5000–6000 people, propping up another hateful
                        radical regime—we can expect another chorus of discontent from the Saudis,
                        Israelis, Jordanians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Egyptians and others about an
                        America which is unable or unwilling to act. While we may be constrained in
                        acting in the public arena at the moment—by the precarious position of the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty and our limited interests
                        in Afghanistan and limited resources which can be brought to bear, we should
                        consider a more active clandestine effort in both propaganda and support for
                        rebel groups. Iran would probably be sympathetic. The Paks would cooperate.
                        The Iraqis would not object. The Saudis would be mollified. The stakes would
                        be raised for the Soviets near our most crucial and vulnerable overseas
                        resource region—the Gulf.</p>

                    <p rend="center">KEY JUDGMENTS</p>
                    <p>Moscow probably views the situation in Afghanistan as even more unstable
                        after the fall of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. While the
                        Soviets may have previously decided to implement new military measures to
                        support <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> against the rebels,
                        the uncertain tenure of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s regime makes it likely that Moscow is deferring major
                        new initiatives to expand the counterinsurgency effort pending a decision as
                        to whether <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> can consolidate his
                        position. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviets, however, have imposed an increased readiness posture on airborne
                        forces in the Turkestan Military District, evidently as a result of concern
                        over regime stability in the wake of the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> coup. They may fear that this coup might fragment the
                        Afghan Army and lead to a breakdown of control in Kabul. In this event, they
                        would be likely to deploy one or more Soviet airborne divisions to the Kabul
                        vicinity to protect Soviet citizens already there as well as to ensure
                        continuance of some pro-Soviet regime in the capital. Although we might not
                        receive prior warning, we believe it likely that we would promptly detect a
                        deployment of Soviet forces on this scale once it began. We do not believe
                        that Moscow would intend such a deployment for use in fighting against the
                        Muslim insurgency, although, once in Afghanistan, such Soviet airborne
                        forces could eventually be drawn into such fighting. We have not seen
                        indications that the Soviets are at the moment preparing ground forces for
                        large-scale military intervention in Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><pb n="189" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_189"/>In the months before the coup, as
                        the insurgency in Afghanistan intensified and spread, the Soviets increased
                        the numbers and expanded the counterinsurgency role there of what now are at
                        least 2,500 of their military personnel, who are heavily involved in guiding
                        combat operations. Moscow may also have permitted direct participation of
                        Soviet helicopter pilots, and possibly some tank personnel, in combat
                        alongside the Afghans. In addition, we believe that one lightly equipped
                        Soviet airborne battalion has been quietly deployed in Afghanistan since
                        early July to provide security at Bagram Air Force Base.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] believes that there is insufficient evidence to
                            determine the role or function of the Soviet unit deployed at Bagram Air
                            Force Base. There is no evidence that this unit is equipped with
                            crew-served weapons. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Meanwhile,
                        also during the summer of 1979, the Soviets have apparently tried and failed
                        to induce the regime to admit other political elements to the government to
                        broaden its base.<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">See <ref target="#d56">Document
                                56</ref>.</note> All these measures have proved inadequate to halt
                        the deterioration of the regime’s position. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s seizure of sole power within
                        the Khalqist regime in mid-September has further complicated these Soviet
                        problems in dealing with both the regime and the insurgency. We believe that
                        the Soviets probably did not instigate or foresee this move by <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. Moreover, they probably also
                        evaluated it as rendering the counterinsurgency task more difficult, at
                        least in the short term, because it further narrowed the regime’s base of
                        support, and, in fact, threatened to divide the ruling party itself. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>If Moscow, within the next few weeks, concludes that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has consolidated his position and that
                        no effective challenge from within the regime and the Army is likely, we
                        believe the Soviets will probably increase their counterinsurgency role over
                        the next few months, albeit incrementally rather than dramatically. In this
                        case, Moscow may further increase the number of Soviet advisers and expand
                        their combat activities, and may gradually bring in additional special
                        battalions or regiments to provide security in key cities. In addition,
                        Moscow could bolster the counterinsurgency effort by providing Soviet-manned
                        combat support and combat service support units, such as attack helicopter,
                        logistic, and maintenance units, to enhance Afghan combat reach and
                        effectiveness. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not

                    <p>We believe the introduction into Afghanistan of additional Soviet battalion-
                        or regiment-size units for security purposes, like the forces already at
                        Bagram, could be accomplished without immediate detection if this were done
                        gradually, along with the ongoing airlift of materiel. <pb n="190" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_190"/>Our ability to detect promptly the
                        incremental introduction of Soviet combat support and combat service support
                        units is similarly limited, although time would increase the probability of
                        our learning that such units had entered Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are probably well aware of the open-ended military and political
                        difficulties that could flow if such limited intervention were allowed to
                        grow into a larger and more visible commitment. They are also aware of the
                        adverse political consequences this would entail for them in South Asia and
                        the Middle East. On the other hand, it is clear that the Soviets’ sense of
                        their interests in Afghanistan is now more ambitious than it was before the
                        advent of the Marxist regime in 1978. They see the maintenance of a Marxist
                        state in Afghanistan as important to their strategic and political interests
                        in the region. This perception has increasingly supplanted the Soviets’
                        earlier and less ambitious goal of simply maintaining a friendly buffer
                        state on their southern border. If they do decide to provide some additional
                        military support to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, they are
                        likely to do so in the hope of bolstering the anti-insurgent struggle
                        sufficiently to avoid facing a decision as to whether to use Soviet combat
                        units on a large scale. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and
                            codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In the event that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> does not
                        consolidate his position but that an acceptable and viable Marxist
                        alternative emerges, the Soviets are likely to shift their political and
                        military support accordingly. If no such viable leftist alternative appears,
                        and the Khalqi regime fragments, the Soviets would promote installation of a
                        more moderate regime willing to deal with them, rather than accept the
                        political costs and risks of a massive Soviet invasion to fight the
                        insurgency. Nevertheless, we can foresee contingencies under which the
                        chances of large-scale and long-term Soviet intervention would become
                        substantially greater:</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> traded mutual
                        expressions of interest in improving bilateral relations, but agreed on
                        little else. Discussion touched on the <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> assassination and the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> approach to acceptance of foreign assistance. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> endorsed good relations with
                        Pakistan, but complained that Afghan “fugitives” were being trained there.
                        He minimized the Soviet presence in Afghanistan and defended his
                        government’s independence and non-alignment. We expressed appreciation for
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s interest in controlling

                            <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> for a general hour-long
                        exchange of views Sept 27 in New York. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> and <gloss target="#t_NEA_1">NEA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAB_1">PAB</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_PR_2">Peck</persName> sat in. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> had only a notetaker with him.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> opened by noting that when
                        he was last in Afghanistan he had met with then-President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and Fon. Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">See <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note> He wanted to use the
                        opportunity of the FonMin’s visit to extend his best wishes to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and to <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> as they assumed their new responsibilities.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said Chargé <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> had reported that he had a cordial
                        conversation earlier the same day with President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">The meeting between

                            from Kabul, September 27. <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> described the meeting as “amicable” and reported

                            substantive discussion beyond sharing <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s “oft-repeated request” to improve relations
                            between the United States and Afghanistan. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                    <p>5. In response <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> said the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> had from the beginning wanted to
                        have good relations with all countries without exception. Afghanistan had
                        traditionally friendly relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> had been
                        desirous of maintaining these ties. Referring to the <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> assassination, <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> said “certain events” had
                        occurred which the <pb n="192" facs="0237" xml:id="pg_192"/><gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> did not want. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> had done its best to prove that these events had been
                        outside its control.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> noted that the reaction in
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to the <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> assassination had been very strong and led to the
                        congressional action which reduced somewhat our cooperation. We have tried
                        to extend our assistance programs as long as we could under the law, and are
                        phasing out our programs in an orderly fashion. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was always ready to discuss steps which might be taken to
                        put our relations back on a more normal basis. We welcomed word that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> wanted better
                        relations. When the time came when better relations could be discussed, we
                        were willing to explore how the conditions laid down by Congress might be
                            met.<note n="5" xml:id="d68fn5">A reference to the Senate Foreign

                            amendment, inserted at the end of Chapter 1 of Part III of the Foreign

                    <p>7. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName>’s suggestion
                        that “false propaganda” on this issue had unduly influenced <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> political leaders, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said it was the events surrounding
                        the assassination that were responsible, not newspaper reports. We also felt
                        that we had not gotten as much cooperation in the investigation as we could
                        have expected. In defense, <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName>
                        pointed to the serious doubts still remaining about the Kennedy
                        assassination and reiterated that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        believed it had done its best.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> said that it was because of
                        the previous friendly relations between our two countries that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> considered the present situation to be
                        “abnormal.” He saw no hindrance or problem which could not be solved. He
                        denied that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> was turning away from
                        the prior Afghan practice of drawing on multiple aid sources and advisers in
                        putting together cooperative projects. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah
                            Wali</persName> pointed to the continuation of World Bank, German and
                        other projects, and argued that Afghanistan’s actions in some “specific
                        cases” (read <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>) had arisen from a feeling
                        that individuals <pb n="193" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_193"/>did not have
                        proper qualifications. He added that Afghanistan had asked for more
                        personnel in certain cases, citing their request to Care-Medico (which had a
                        large <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> personnel component) for more
                        medical specialists. He added with apparent regret that Care-Medico had been
                        unable to comply, and that he had learned shortly before departing Kabul of
                        Care-Medico’s decision to withdraw all of its personnel from the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> replied in the negative
                        when asked if he expected changes in basic <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> policies following recent leadership changes. He expected
                        continuity since the policies were laid down by the party, and the party
                        still existed. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said we had
                        noticed President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s stated
                        desire for good relations with Afghanistan’s neighbors Pakistan and Iran.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> said this reflected the
                        sincere desires of the Afghan people and the party. He said Deputy FonMin
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM_1">Dost</persName>’s visit to Pakistan had
                        resulted in “fruitful talks,” and that he had met with <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> in Havana and former President
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> had also talked with
                        Pakistani President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> there. He was
                        careful to point out that the latter meeting “reflected the desire of our
                        government.” He indicated that both <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had been
                        invited to Kabul, but that it was understood <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> would come only after an <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> visit had taken place.</p>
                    <p>10. At another point in the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah
                            Wali</persName> took a mild swipe at Pakistan when discussing the
                        underlying causes of the insurgency. He said the rebels were mostly those
                        who had lost their former feudal privileges, but added that part of the
                        problem was created by Afghanistan’s neighbors. He pointed to the camps in
                        Pakistan where Afghan “fugitives” were trained. He added that Pakistan also
                        sent some “militia” into Afghanistan. Asked about the refugee situation,
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> argued that
                        Afghanistan’s borders were very porous and that 2.5 million nomads crossed
                        the frontiers every year. The explanation, he concluded, was that “they have
                        detained our nomads.”</p>
                    <p>11. On the subject of relations with the Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> said Afghanistan’s traditional
                        good relations with its northern neighbor had changed little with the change
                        of governments over the years. Asked if he saw any contradiction between
                        Afghanistan’s profession of non-alignment and the presence of Soviet troops
                        in the country, <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> said the
                        numbers of Soviet advisers had been exaggerated. A mountain had been made
                        out of mole-hill. He pointed out that Afghanistan had had Soviet advisers
                        before the revolution, and said the number had not changed much. He declined
                        to be pinned down as to exact numbers there now, and said there were
                        advisers from other nations such as India. In apparent contradiction of his
                        earlier statement, he concluded there had been no qualitative change in the
                        situation, just a quantitative one.</p>
                    <p><pb n="194" facs="0239" xml:id="pg_194"/>12. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah
                            Wali</persName> also declined to be pinned down as to whether the
                        Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) was a Marxist-Leninist party. He said we could judge
                        ourselves from the program of the party. The <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>, he added, reflected the Socialist structure of the
                        country. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> recalled his earlier
                        discussion with then Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> on the nature of the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> in light of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        legislation bearing on relations with nations dominated or controlled by the

                        movement or as a purely Afghan entity? <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah
                            Wali</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> wanted
                        relations with all parties, not just those in Socialist countries. He
                        assured <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> that his was a
                        sovereign government not under the influence of another government or party.
                        Afghanistan was faithful to the Non-Aligned Movement and wanted to have a
                        policy of its own. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> commented
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> respected “true
                        non-alignment,” but that we had philosophical differences with some
                        countries’ definition of non-alignment—specifically that of Cuba.</p>
                    <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> said we appreciated the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s interest in controlling the flow
                        of narcotics. Describing narcotics as a major national problem in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> said we were prepared to work with Afghan
                        authorities and would appreciate any cooperation the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> might give. <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> brightened visibly in thanking us for mentioning
                        this matter. He said the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> had burned a
                        cache of hashish last year worth dols 25 million, but the Western press had
                        paid this no heed. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> regretted
                        the lack of publicity but said we in the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had noticed. We recognized the difficulties countries faced
                        in interfering with traditional narcotics culture and trafficking,
                        particularly since narcotics could be an important source of income for poor
                        farmers. It was an act of courage for a government in a country such as
                        Afghanistan to take a strong stand, and we appreciated this. He added this
                        was a positive element in our relations.</p>
                    <p>14. In closing, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said he wanted
                        to keep the lines of communication between our two countries open. He had
                        asked a lot of questions, but this had been in the interest of finding a
                        basis on which we could improve our relations. He had been encouraged by the
                        reception President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had given to
                        our Chargé earlier in the day and hoped this would signal continued

                            Taraki</persName> from the Afghan Presidency in mid-September 1979,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> sent Dastigar
                        Panjshiri, Minister of Public Works to the Soviet Union with a personal

                        points:</p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> claimed that he was not
                        responsible for the 14 September crisis which resulted in the removal of
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and the three military
                        members of the Cabinet. The events of that day had been forced upon him.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s fall has not affected the
                        relationship between Afghanistan and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>; Afghanistan continues to require the full support of the

                        Afghanistan’s revolution.</p>
                    <p>C. The fall of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> has not
                        affected the historical outlook of Afghanistan, an outlook that is shared by

                    <p>Our confrontation with the Soviets over Cuba arose because of the premature
                        release of intelligence into a highly charged, domestic political
                        atmosphere. While Afghanistan is not Cuba, both countries receive
                        substantial Soviet military assistance. In Afghanistan, even more than in
                        Cuba, Soviet policy is dictated by security concerns and, therefore, is less
                        susceptible to arguments that it should be altered for the good of US-Soviet
                        relations. Of immediate importance, however, is the fact that in both cases
                        the findings of the Intelligence Community can have a serious effect upon
                        our relations with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The events of the last two weeks provide a graphic illustration. On September
                        16–17, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s takeover in Kabul
                        coincided with intelligence reports that a Soviet airborne division
                        designated for service in Afghanistan was in heightened readiness.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note>
                        The intelligence implied a threat of Soviet intervention and created a
                        perceived need for a US response. In rapid order, we launched a campaign of
                        high level press backgrounders, spokesman’s statements and diplomatic
                        demarches which noted “increased Soviet military activity north of the Oxus”
                        and repeated US opposition to Soviet intervention.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">See, for example, <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Harold
                                Saunders</persName>’s September 29 statement before the Subcommittee
                            on Asian and Pacific Affairs of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
                            the situation in Afghanistan in the Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 1979, pp. 53–54. See also the
                            Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 1979, p.
                            43, which reprinted a Department statement to the news media, October
                            29, that “we are opposed to intervention by any country in Afghanistan’s
                            internal affairs.” The reference to a diplomatic démarche is likely to
                            instructions in telegram 250400 to multiple posts, September 23, to
                            inform host governments of “disturbing signs of increased Soviet
                            military activity north of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>-Afghanistan border.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D790435–0449)</note> Although the Intelligence Community admitted it had
                        no direct evidence linking the unit’s activity with the Afghan power
                        struggle, we acted because we could not take a chance that the Soviets might
                        move.</p>
                    <p>Since the airborne unit was not deployed and now has apparently stood down,
                        it might be argued that our action may have done some <pb n="197" facs="0242" xml:id="pg_197"/>good and, at least, did no harm. However,
                        this conclusion would ignore the impact on US-Soviet relations and on US
                        credibility in general.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets were not planning to use those forces in Afghanistan, they
                        probably view our actions as yet another propaganda campaign and not as a
                        serious initiative. Further, having raised the possibility of Soviet action
                        with our friends, we have risked being accused of “crying wolf” or, worse,
                        of being clearly aware of “the Soviet threat” without doing anything about
                        it. With both our friends and the Soviets, we cannot raise the spectre of
                        Soviet intervention too often without having our statements discounted.</p>
                    <p>In our consideration of the Afghan problem, we have had a sliding definition
                        of “Soviet intervention.”</p>
                    <p>—In the beginning, we simply talked about “Soviet military intervention”; <hi rend="italic">however</hi>, with a $275 million military assistance
                        program in process and 3,000 or more advisors in the country, this has
                        already occurred.</p>
                    <p>—Subsequently, we talked about “the introduction of Soviet combat units”; <hi rend="italic">however</hi>, with the introduction in June 1979 of a
                        security force of 400 Soviet troops at Bagram airbase, this has already
                        occurred.</p>
                    <p>—Lately, we have talked about “large scale Soviet intervention”; <hi rend="italic">however</hi>, with an earlier report of 3,600 Soviet
                        military personnel in Kabul and a more recent report of 500–1,000 Soviet
                        advisors arriving at two Afghan armored divisions nearby, this may also have
                        occurred or be in progress.</p>
                    <p>Unless we are treated to a spectacular show of Soviet airborne units being
                        airlifted <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> into Afghanistan, we may not know
                        that large scale transfers of personnel have occurred. The Intelligence
                        Community readily admits that it cannot monitor incremental increases and
                        might not know of the existence of a large Soviet force until it was already
                        in place. Should this occur, the parallel with the situation in Cuba would
                        become obvious.</p>
                    <p>In response to a belated US discovery of a large concentration of Soviet
                        forces, the Soviets would say that their personnel were simply advisors, not
                        different in “kind or purpose” from those we had previously noted. It would
                        then again be our word against theirs that the situation had changed.</p>
                    <p>An inter-agency working group has recently decided that “prevention of large
                        scale Soviet intervention” is our primary goal in Afghanistan.<note n="4" xml:id="d70fn4">Not further identified.</note> Since we have no
                        definition of “large scale” and have difficulties in monitoring Soviet
                        activity, we may not know with any precision <pb n="198" facs="0243" xml:id="pg_198"/>when and if this occurs. It would, therefore, be in our
                        interest to begin thinking about how we will handle this situation in terms
                        of US-Soviet relations, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and the
                        Congress in advance. Otherwise, an intelligence “breakthrough,” plus a press
                        leak, or a Congressman’s statement about “Soviet brigades in Afghanistan”
                        could put us right back in another US-Soviet confrontation.</p>
                    <p>At a minimum, we should try to ensure that any public announcement of such an
                        intelligence finding be placed in the proper context. This would suggest an
                        official spokesman’s statement that while we deplore Soviet intervention we
                        see it as a sign of the failure of Soviet policy and not as a success.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I recommend that you discuss with <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Stan
                            Turner</persName> how to ensure that intelligence reports on Soviet
                        military actions are not allowed to reach persons who might make them public
                        in a sensational manner. In particular, we should consider ending our
                        present practice of treating this subject in the <gloss target="#t_NID_1">NID</gloss> and other publications which receive wide distribution.
                        Instead we should work with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to develop
                        a means of providing this information only to a carefully selected list of
                        officials under stringent controls over further dissemination. We should
                        also consider similar restrictions on cables from Embassy Kabul which deal
                        with Soviet military involvement in Afghanistan.</p>

                        Afghanistan’s Independence and the Position of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>: Part One of Two.</p>
                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary. Much concern has been expressed in Washington over Soviet troop
                        movements on the Soviet side of the Oxus, but more significant and ominous
                        may be the growing Soviet military presence in Afghanistan. The number of
                        troops and military advisors—totalling perhaps 7,000—and the role the latter
                        are playing, makes it moot whether this or any other Afghan regime can again
                        exercise full independence. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. While a great deal of concern has been expressed in Washington about the
                        possible positioning of Soviet airborne troops just north of the Oxus, I
                        think a more dangerous and significant development has been the continued
                        build-up of Soviet equipment and forces in the country, and the recent
                        appointment of Soviet generals to direct the counter-insurgency operations
                        in the troubled Provinces of Paktia, Ghazni and Konar.</p>
                    <p>4. To recapitulate the situation:</p>
                    <p>(A). Soviet troops are now known to be stationed in the following two
                        strategic areas:</p>
                    <p>—Bagram Air Force Base, located about 25 miles north of Kabul, the single
                        most important air base in the country. The number of Soviet troops guarding
                        the base is modest: about 600. More significant is that the Soviets have
                        apparently been given control of the base. It together with Kabul Airport
                        (partly an Air Force base as well) are highly strategic points for control
                        of the capital and surrounding areas.</p>
                    <p>—Kabul itself at probably three locations: Kabul Airport (at the Air Force
                        area), Pol-i-Charki tank base, and the Microrayon apartment complex where
                        many Soviets live. These troops, numbering perhaps 3,600 are probably here
                        for several purposes, such as guarding the Soviet community in the event of
                        civil war and chaos. The troops would also be in a position to try to secure
                        Kabul Airport and the principal tank base (over 150 tanks) if necessary.</p>
                    <p><pb n="200" facs="0245" xml:id="pg_200"/>(B). The amount of military
                        equipment continues to arrive in impressive amounts. The large number of
                        military tanks at Pol-i-Charki tank base appears to be well in excess of the
                        number of Afghan troops able to operate them.</p>
                    <p>(C). The number of Soviet military advisers seems to be always increasing and
                        may now number about 3,000.</p>
                    <p>(D). Perhaps just as important is the fact that the role of these military
                        advisers seems to have been enhanced over the last some weeks. This may be
                        connected with the 6-week-long visit of a contingent of 13 Soviet generals
                        in country. The growing role of the Soviets is noticeable in two ways. One
                        is the elevation of three Soviet generals to positions of, in effect,
                        directing the counter-insurgency operations in the three most troubled
                        Provinces: Paktia, Ghazni and Konar. The other is growing evidence of more
                        sophisticated counter-insurgency tactics in at least the Ghazni area,
                        pointing to a Soviet hand.</p>
                    <p>5. I think the expanded Soviet role in the country raises some fundamental
                        political and policy questions for us. One is whether the Soviets are not
                        now in such an influential position that they have a controlling influence
                        over the regime and the country’s future. While I do not suggest that the
                        country has totally lost its independence, I wonder whether the Soviet
                        presence and influence here are not now such that Afghanistan should be
                        classified as a Soviet satellite state akin to most of those in Eastern
                        Europe and Mongolia. Certainly, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName>, or any other party successor, is very beholden to the
                        Soviets to stay in power. The leverage and influence the Soviets can now
                        exert is tremendous, and given the unpopularity of the Khalqis, no Khalqi
                        regime could last a week here were the Soviets to withdraw their support.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> and senior party
                        officials must know this.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">An October 7 <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> intelligence report, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] listed numerous reasons
                            for <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s unpopularity among
                            Afghans. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] asserted there
                            was widespread belief that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                            killed the more popular <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>;
                            that he was “openly prejudiced in favor of Pashtuns;” that he was an
                            “avowed Communist infidel;” and that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> “has given considerable authority to the Soviets in
                            return for their support, and is selling out Afghanistan to the
                            Soviets.” (Department of Defense, Afghan War Collection, Box 4, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in Afghanistan (October
                        79))</note></p>
                    <p>6. I also see no likelihood that the Soviets intend to diminish their
                        military presence or their special position in this country. Were <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>, or a successor, to desire
                        to expel the Soviets, I doubt they could now do it. The Soviets would likely
                        respond by putting forward <pb n="201" facs="0246" xml:id="pg_201"/>some
                        amenable Khalqi “leader” who would “request” the continued Soviet presence,
                        and there are probably enough in the party who would go along with a
                        change.</p>
                    <p>7. By septel (part two), I discuss <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName>, his likely vision of the Soviet role, and where the

                            with us, the time has come for a further review of our basic approach to
                            Afghanistan.” <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> further
                            noted that recently <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had
                            sought to improve communication with the United States and, with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> due back in
                            Washington for consultation, his presence could be a “focal point” for a

                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary. Though the dominant position of the Soviets in Afghanistan is
                        probably due more to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>
                        than to any other Khalqi leader, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        is a nationalist. His vision for Afghanistan may be a Marxist one—but it is
                        for an independent state. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is
                        probably sincere in professing a desire for friendly relations with the rest
                        of the world, but he has made clear too that he sees Afghanistan as
                        belonging naturally to the pro-Moscow camp of “Socialist” countries. Though
                        claiming that his country will not meddle in the internal affairs of other
                        countries, he speaks of supporting progressive and liberation forces
                        everywhere, and the Pakistanis are worried about <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s frequent abstruse references to the Afghan peoples
                        between the Oxus and <pb n="203" facs="0248" xml:id="pg_203"/>the Indus. As
                        for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations, I think they will remain
                        difficult, if for no other reason than <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s Persian-language broadcasts which the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> finds irritating. If the insurgency starts
                        to ebb—and it has shown few signs of intensifying—we may have to come to
                        terms with <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. Of fundamental
                        interest to us will be whether the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can
                        woo, to any degree, Afghanistan away from Moscow’s orbit and can discourage
                        any inclination by <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to be
                        irredentist. I am not sure we can. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Though <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> has welcomed
                        the massive support of the Soviets, I believe him nonetheless to be a
                        nationalist—and the only strong Khalqi leader around. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has shown himself to be intelligent,
                        decisive, and extraordinarily energetic. He is also ruthless; otherwise he
                        would not be where he is.</p>
                    <p>4. While in part one of this message, I expressed concern that the Soviets
                        may now have a commanding influence in this country, I believe also it would
                        be a mistake to characterize <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> as
                        a Soviet toady. We have lots of evidence that he wants to run his own show,
                        and that Moscow is less than ecstatic over the successive purges which have
                        caused division in and depleted the ranks of the “progressive forces.” In
                        this respect, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah
                            Wali</persName> made a remarkable series of disclosures this week. On
                        Oct 6, he invited all the “Socialist country” Ambassadors (excepting the
                        Chinese) for a briefing. According to the Yugoslav Ambassador who was there,
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> spent most of the time
                        telling about the Sept 14 Palace shootout when <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was removed, and made the following startling
                        disclosures:</p>
                    <p>—Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> was with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> on Sept 14 when <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was called over to the latter’s office
                        to be arrested. The inference is that the Soviets knew about the
                            anti-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> plot.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">For discussion of alleged Soviet foreknowledge of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s ouster, see <ref target="#d65">Document 65</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>—After the shootout, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s departing
                        car was fired on in the Palace complex by a rooftop sniper, apparently
                        pre-positioned, but <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had left
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s building by another
                        way.</p>
                    <p>—Interior Minister <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>, together
                        with the two other military-officer Cabinet ministers plus the secret police
                        chief, fled to the Soviet Embassy but later allegedly left there.</p>
                    <p>—At the Soviet Embassy, <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>
                        placed a phone call to the Kabul Central Military Command ordering immediate
                        action against <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. But the
                        commander refused to act unless so ordered by the Politbureau. Thus ended
                        the anti-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> plot.</p>
                    <p>5. Though the above Sept 14 account shows that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> may not be Moscow’s first preference as the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leader, Moscow has now <pb n="204" facs="0249" xml:id="pg_204"/>seemingly accepted <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and reached a modus vivendi with him.
                        Last week, when I asked the Hungarian Ambassador about Moscow’s alleged
                        unhappiness over the purges of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>,
                        and the reported coolness between <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and Moscow, he cautioned against reading too much into
                        this. He said, “As long as Afghanistan does not change its basic policies
                        (read Communism and a pro-Moscow foreign policy), Moscow doesn’t care who is
                        in charge.” From Moscow’s and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s
                        behavior since September 14, I think the Ambassador may be right.</p>
                    <p>6. This is not to say that the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>-Soviet relationship has been or will be an easy one. Before
                        Sept 14, there was tugging and pulling on both sides—and now there may be
                        distrust. A few days ago, an Asian Ambassador here aptly described the
                        situation when he said: “They are like a husband and wife who don’t much
                        care for each other but nightly keep climbing into the same bed, because
                        each has compelling needs and no options.”</p>
                    <p>7. If <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> survives, a relevant
                        concern for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will be whether, in
                        shaping foreign policy, he will keep a low profile such as did Hungary’s
                        Kadar or be bent on playing an active international role like Fidel Castro.
                        The departing Pakistani Ambassador (to be Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary)
                        fears the latter. He sees <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> as
                        irredentist, and told me that during his farewell call on <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, the latter’s evasive answers on
                        Pushtunistan and Baluchistan heightened rather than assuaged his fears. This
                        is notwithstanding assertions, like Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Shah Wali</persName> made to me last week, that
                        Afghanistan has “no territorial ambitions.”</p>
                    <p>8. As for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghanistan relations, if
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and his Khalqi Party survive
                        (and I fear time is working in their favor), we will have to give thought as
                        to what kind of presence and role we can have here. Can we exert a
                        moderating influence? I am not sure we can, though the Sept 14 incident
                        involving the Soviets gives some grounds for cautious hope. Certainly
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> would welcome resumption of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> economic aid—on their terms—but I
                        am doubtful this would necessarily give us leverage. When we had a $17
                        million aid program here, we enjoyed almost no influence.</p>
                    <p>9. I doubt, too, that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> would ever
                        sincerely turn to us (or to the Chinese or Yugoslavs) as a political
                        alternative to the Soviets. For one, our political ideology is so different
                        from his. I also don’t think the Soviets would allow it, and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> must realize this. Yet, I cannot
                        ignore that in years past, nationalism has been a powerful force in
                        Afghanistan, rejecting foreign influence. It is conceivable that over the
                        next year or so it could assert itself in ways which would diminish the
                        Soviet presence. The insurgency is one manifestation of this. Though so far
                        the rebellion has disappointed many well wishers, and does not immediately
                        threaten this regime, it may gain momentum.</p>
                    <p><pb n="205" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_205"/>10. What should our posture be
                        during this period of uncertainty? I think our best strategy is to continue
                        what we have essentially been doing: maintaining a low profile, trying to
                        avoid disputatious bilateral issues, and waiting to see what happens.</p>

                    <p>7421. <gloss target="#t_Subj_1">Subj</gloss>: (U) <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Announces Death of Former President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. (U) Kabul Radio announced last night in a brief news item that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Noor Mohammad Taraki</persName>, recently deposed
                        President of Afghanistan, had died that morning (October 9) after a severe
                        illness. The announcement added that he was buried in the family graveyard
                        the same day. We have, thus far, not noted any particular signs of mourning
                        in Kabul. Government flags remain at full mast and there have been no public
                        demonstrations of regret at <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s
                        passing.</p>
                    <p>2. (C) According to a source with wide-ranging contacts in Afghan circles, a
                        Cabinet official had disclosed two weeks ago that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> had died during or soon after the
                        September 14 shootout at Kabul’s Presidential Palace, which brought
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to power. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and his government’s official public
                        line since that time has been that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was under a doctor’s care because of a severe
                        illness. A <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> official had recently
                        insisted to an officer of this mission that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was paralyzed on one side and that that was why he

                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and his crowd to be nothing
                        more than opportunistic usurpers. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is undoubtedly aware of such resentment and is

                            The meeting took place in the White House Situation Room. The summary of
                            conclusions was attached at Tab B to a memorandum (not printed) from

                            Presidential Finding with the scope of Afghanistan stated: “provide
                            support, either directly or through third countries, to the Afghan
                            insurgents in the form of cash, non-military supplies, communications
                            equipment and procurement advice.” Under the description, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “My preference is that

                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representatives pointed out that they
                        followed naturally on the actions that had already been undertaken as a
                        result of the Presidential Finding of 3 July 1979.<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">See <ref target="#d53fn5">footnote 5, Document
                            53</ref>.</note> The State Department representative suggested that all
                        further actions supporting the Afghan rebels be deferred until spring so
                        that we could see how the insurgency fared through the winter months, but
                        all other members of the committee felt the need to act now was urgent. The
                        Chairman stressed the political importance of demonstrating to Saudi Arabian
                        leaders that we were serious in opposing Soviet inroads in Afghanistan and
                        the likelihood that a substantial commitment of assistance on our part would
                        result in increased Saudi willingness to provide support. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representatives pointed out that delays of
                        various kinds were bound to occur even under the best of circumstances but
                        that decisions made now greatly improved the possibility that some of our
                        aid could reach rebel forces in time to help them through the strains of the
                        winter. (S)</p>
                    <p>The committee concluded by endorsing unanimously a proposal for [<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] of additional aid for Afghan
                        rebels, to be provided primarily through Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the
                        form of cash, communications equipment, non-military supplies and
                        procurement advice. No more than [<hi rend="italic">amount not
                            declassified</hi>] of this sum will be for communications equipment. An
                        amendment to the Presidential Finding of 3 July 1979 will be prepared. The
                        Chairman directed <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to undertake at an
                        early date a briefing of senior Saudi leaders (specifically Prince Sultan
                        and Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName>) on Afghanistan and
                        our decisions on aid for the insurgents. (S)</p>

                                jointly (with the Saudis and Pakistanis) and unilaterally, for the
                                procurement of non-military supplies; and provide additional funds

                        <p>1. A 3 July 1979 Presidential Finding authorized <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to expend up to $695,000 to support the Afghan
                            insurgents, either unilaterally or through third countries, by providing
                            cash or non-military supplies; and also authorized <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> propaganda operations in support of
                            the insurgency. At the time the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                            discussed this proposal, it was agreed that consideration would be given
                            in the future to increased support should circumstances indicate
                            additional funds were warranted.</p>
                        <p>2. Since receiving this authorization, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has expended or obligated $575,000 in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 79, and has programmed the remaining
                            $120,000 for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 80. These funds have
                            been or will be expended as follows:</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] in cash payments to the
                            insurgents and the provision of a limited amount of medical
                            supplies.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] for propaganda
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>Pakistani liaison has begun to disburse some of these funds and medical
                            supplies to insurgents inside Afghanistan. Unilateral assets have
                            separately transferred funds into Afghanistan, and to insurgent leaders
                            in Pakistan. Propaganda activities have included the procurement of two
                            complete radio broadcasting stations which are now in Pakistan awaiting
                            onward shipment into Afghanistan. A support mechanism to produce
                            propaganda material, including tapes for broadcast on insurgent radios
                            and for hand-to-hand passage inside Afghanistan, has been created and is
                            in operation.</p>
                        <p>3. The Afghan insurgency has intensified and spread, and Afghan
                            Government forces are increasingly stretched thin in their efforts to
                            suppress it. At the same time, it is clear that the insurgents continue
                            to lack funds and as yet are uncoordinated. The Soviets appear to have
                            stepped up their support to the Afghan Government. It is likely that
                            this winter will see something of a hiatus in military operations by <pb n="209" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_209"/>both sides—a result of the
                            insurgents’ shortage of supplies and the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s likely desire to reorganize in the wake of both a
                            long spring/summer campaign and recent political changes in Kabul.</p>
                        <p>4. It is too early to estimate precisely what effect the limited funding
                            may have had on the insurgency. Indeed, some of the funds are still in
                            the pipeline and have not yet reached the insurgents. The creation of a
                            production mechanism to prepare propaganda materials, and the delivery
                            of two radio transmitters to Pakistan to give the insurgents their “own
                            radio” are significant steps. However, the effect of a propaganda
                            operation is incremental and is part of a larger effort. The
                            intensification of the insurgency will be abetted by these support
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>5. The insurgents have a continued critical need for funds. Timing is
                            important. The current need is particularly relevant in view of both the
                            expected hard winter, which will impede any resupply efforts, and an
                            anticipated increase in Afghan Government pressure on the
                            insurgents—possibly this winter, almost certainly in the spring.</p>
                        <p>Specific proposals on expending this sum are:</p>
                        <p>—An approach to the Saudis stating that we have already provided aid to
                            the insurgents—citing funds, medical supplies, and radio broadcast
                            transmitters. We would tell the Saudis that we wish to provide
                            additional aid—[<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] for
                            non-military support—and would inform the Saudis of our interest in
                            discussing what support they may wish to provide in concert with our
                            efforts. (This step is intended to accomplish several ends: to spur
                            significant Saudi contributions, thus increasing the total amount of aid
                            provided; to give evidence to the Saudis of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government’s determination, expressed in concrete
                            terms, to oppose communism; and to meet a recent Pakistani liaison
                            request for our assistance in coordinating external support for the
                            insurgents.) [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            informal discussions with the Saudis indicated Saudi receptivity.</p>
                        <p>—Depending on our discussions with the Saudis, we may subsequently
                            participate in joint discussions with the Saudis and Pakistanis on
                            coordinated support to the insurgency.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] would be reserved for
                            unilateral passage to insurgents or for subsequent passage to
                            liaison.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] would be utilized to
                            continue and expand propaganda activities, including support for
                            insurgent clandestine radio broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>Risk: Operational risks are low. However, the insurgency has placed great
                            strain on the Afghan Army and challenges the continued survival of the
                            Government. To counter this, the Soviets have gradually augmented their
                            military advisory presence, and the role of Soviet troops has
                            increasingly changed from an advisory one to active partici<pb n="210" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_210"/>pation in and supervision of
                            anti-insurgent military operations. It is possible that further
                            insurgent successes might prompt still greater Soviet involvement, which
                            could range from still more advisors and equipment to the use of Soviet
                            combat units. (TAB D)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TAP_1">Prince Turki</persName> Ibn Faysal,
                            Director of the Saudi Arabian General Intelligence Service, recently
                            recommended to [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAP_1">Prince Turki</persName> expressed concern at
                            what he perceived as <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> failure to
                            defend its own (and by implication, Saudi Arabia’s) interests in such
                            areas as Zaire, Iran, Somalia and Afghanistan. At the same time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAP_1">Turki</persName> recognized the
                            difficulties which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would have
                            encountered in intervening in these areas overtly. He implicitly
                            recognized that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi collaboration
                            could provide a means for masking <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            support of friendly elements in Middle East crisis areas.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TAP_1">Turki</persName> suggested a number of
                            areas for such collaboration, including Afghanistan. He stated that his
                            government was providing limited support to the insurgents. In addition,
                            he mentioned that their insurgent contacts reported that lack of radio
                            communications was seriously hampering the coordination of their
                            military activities.</p>
                        <p>3. It is believed that approaching <persName corresp="#p_TAP_1">Turki</persName> with a proposal that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> provide communications equipment to the insurgents,
                            possibly through Saudi channels and attributable to the Saudis, would
                            allow us to propose that the Saudis, in addition to our radios, provide
                            significant funds from their own resources to support the insurgency. If
                            the Saudis agreed to the proposal, but indicated that they would
                            prefer—for logistical or other reasons—not to act as “middle-men,” we
                            would give the radios directly to the Pakistanis, and advise the Saudis
                            of our action.</p>
                        <p>4. In addition, this proposal would have the following benefits:</p>
                        <quote><p><pb n="211" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_211"/>a. It would reassure the
                                Saudis of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s interest in
                                resisting the spread of communism in the Middle East;</p>
                            <p>b. It could develop a precedent for using the Saudis as an
                                intermediary, concealing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                involvement, to support friendly political elements or other covert
                                assets elsewhere in the area.</p></quote>
                        <p>5. The lack of radios to coordinate their activities has placed the
                            insurgents at a tactical disadvantage vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. It compels the insurgents to operate
                            on a piece-meal, local basis, and consequently the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> is able to deal with their raids one
                            at a time, bringing preponderant strength to bear on the area of the
                            insurgent attack. Coordinated simultaneous attacks in several areas
                            would force the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> to stretch its
                            forces much more thinly in dealing with these attacks and significantly
                            improve insurgent chances of success. Radios would also permit rapid
                            transmission of intelligence on <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                            activities from one insurgent unit to another, and could also be used to
                            spread propaganda.</p>
                        <p>6. To establish a basic communications net for the insurgents, we would
                            provide 16 transceivers with power supply and related equipment: 12 to
                            serve as active units, and four to be held for spare parts; We would
                            also provide 100 walkie-talkies for tactical use. All equipment would be
                            of foreign manufacture or sterile <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-made equipment.</p>
                        <p>Risk: The provision of foreign-made (or marked) radio equipment should

                        <p>2. The bulk of the purchases would be ammunition for Soviet-made weapons
                            captured by the insurgents from Afghan Government forces, although it
                            may be deemed wise to purchase some ammunition for vintage weapons in

                        <p>3. In addition to ammunition, a small amount of explosives, and perhaps a

                            significant losses to the weapons systems, which they cannot counter.

                    </list>
                    <p>1. We are concerned that in the month that has elapsed since the <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>-Afghanistan Alert
                            Memorandum</hi> and the <gloss target="#t_IIM_1">IIM</gloss>

                        themselves in position to move a larger ground combat force into Afghanistan
                        in less time and affording less advance warning than was believed possible
                        at the time those papers were written. [<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2. Activity at the Soviet ground force installation at Kushka, some five
                        kilometers from the Afghanistan border, indicates that the readiness of the
                        motorized rifle division whose units are located there has been
                        substantially increased. Indeed, the evidence suggests that through the last
                        month at least some elements probably have been fleshed out with reservists
                        to full combat strength. This division sits on the best surface route into
                        Afghanistan. With full manpower and equipment, it could move by road in
                        armed convoy from its present location to as far as, for example, Kandahar
                        in Afghanistan in about 24 hours. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking
                            and codeword not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviet motorized rifle division units at Termez, also located directly
                        adjacent to the Afghanistan border at a major crossing point, have been
                        unusually active recently. The activity there has not been as extensive in
                        either scale or duration as that at Kushka. This division would not be able
                        to move by surface routes into Afghanistan as easily as the one at Kushka
                        because it would have to cross the Oxus by barge. Nevertheless, if the
                        division is at increased manning and readiness, as the evidence suggests, at
                        least major elements could move into the Mazar-i-Sharif area of Afghanistan
                        in 24–48 hours. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p><pb n="215" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_215"/>4. In sum, if those two Soviet
                        motorized divisions located on the Afghanistan border are now manned at
                        higher states of readiness, as the evidence suggests they may be, the
                        Soviets would be able, within about a 48 hour period, to insert an airborne
                        division (the 105th at Fergana) into Kabul, a motorized rifle division into
                        Kandahar, and at least major elements of a motorized rifle division into
                        Mazar-i-Sharif. A major ground force intervention along these lines would
                        not need to be preceded by much if any visible mobilization of army and
                        front level support elements. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>5. At the time the <gloss target="#t_IIM_1">IIM</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic">Soviet Options in Afghanistan</hi> was being drafted the
                        consensus of community analysts was that the Soviets could insert an
                        airborne division and possibly some individual combat units of battalion or
                        regimental size while affording us little warning but that any major
                        military action beyond that probably would have to be the kind of
                        multi-division action that would be clearly indicated well in advance. While
                        that judgement may have been consistent with the situation at the time, we
                        do not believe it remains valid. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking
                            not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>6. Adding to our concern in this regard is information we recently obtained
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] indicating
                        that activity seen in imagery of Kushka and Termez, in the spring of this
                        year, and which was interpreted to be exercise activity of the units
                        normally garrisoned there, actually was an augmentation—albeit apparently of
                        a temporary nature—with additional forces originally located several hundred
                        kilometers from the Afghanistan border. This evidence points to the
                        difficulty of interpreting [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                        declassified</hi>] the significance of activities of ground force units in
                        and around major garrisons. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and
                            codeword not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>7. Another factor that bears on the Soviet ability to quickly move larger
                        forces into Afghanistan is the extent to which major terminals in
                        Afghanistan, particularly the air terminals, have been improved. We do not
                        know, in fact, the full extent of what has taken place in the two months
                        that the <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName> mission has been
                        in Afghanistan. Recent imagery, however, does show that at Bagram airbase
                        parking areas are being blacktopped and a new heightfinder radar now is
                        operational there. Both of these improvements raise the traffic handling
                        capacity of the airfields. We also have unconfirmed information [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] that the Soviets
                        have virtually “taken over” Kandahar airport, which already has been the
                        best equipped in Afghanistan in terms of air traffic capacity. According to
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the cargo of
                        much of the extensive airlift that has been underway in the last two months
                        has been construction materials. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking

                    <p>8. Adding to the ominous nature of these military developments are:</p>
                    <p><pb n="216" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_216"/>a. The recent mutiny of at least
                        elements of an Afghan army division near Kabul. Based on reports of the
                        duration and scale of the measures to suppress it, this latest mutiny
                        appears to be the most serious break yet in the cohesiveness of the Afghan
                        army. Whether and where another uprising might take place must concern the
                        Soviets. The worst case they probably envisage is a <hi rend="italic">defection</hi> (as opposed to a mutiny) of one or two whole divisions
                        to the Muslim insurgency. A military coup could be accommodated by the
                        Soviets, but a major defection could cause the entire situation to become
                        unravelled, making the Soviet options even more unpleasant than they are at
                        present. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>b. Information that on 17 October, shortly after the mutiny, a meeting of the

                    <p>c. Information that <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName> was
                        still in Afghanistan on 19 October apparently awaiting some decision or
                        orders. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Activity at Kushka and Termez</p>
                    <p>9. Beginning in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        imagery of the Kushka ground force installation began to show substantial
                        amounts of ground force equipment in the nearby rail transshipment area.
                        Initially, it was difficult to ascertain whether equipment was coming in or
                        going out. By early September, however, it appeared that the entire garrison
                        had been vacated. While a full interpretation must await a detailed imagery
                        analysis, the types and amounts of equipment suggest that at a minimum a
                        motorized rifle regiment, an artillery unit, an anti-aircraft unit, and some
                        combat support units had moved out. The destination was unknown at the time,
                        but later evidence indicated that a major field training exercise was
                        underway. About [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        later, the same types of units appeared to have begun returning to the
                        garrison. By [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] all
                        units apparently were back. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and
                            codeword not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>10. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] SWS cannot make any firm
                        judgements as to what transpired. While the activity appears to be only
                        exercise-related, we also believe the evidence suggests the forces at Kushka
                        may have been augmented. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and
                            codeword not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>11. In any event, the units at Kushka were believed to be in a Category III
                        (or Cadre) manning status prior to the recent activity. To undergo a field
                        training exercise of the scale and duration of what appears to have taken
                        place in the last month would have required the call-up of a substantial
                        number of reservists. In a sense, the units were in a “mobilized” status at
                        least for the past month. We believe a <pb n="217" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_217"/>detailed study of imagery should be undertaken in an
                        effort to see if the overall status of the division has been upgraded on a
                        permanent basis. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>12. At Termez, a motorized rifle regiment appeared to be vacating its
                        garrison on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in a
                        convoy headed towards a railroad loading area. [<hi rend="italic">less than
                            1 line not declassified</hi>] the activity at the garrison seemed
                        normal, with the vehicles <hi rend="italic">apparently</hi> returned to
                        their sheds. However, a camp of 110 tents was still set up in a training
                        area some seven kilometers away. As is the case with the units at Kushka, a
                        major field training exercise probably would require some call-up of
                        reservists. Moreover, we cannot determine whether the tent camp belongs to
                        the motorized rifle regiment that apparently came out of the Termez garrison
                        on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line, classification, and codeword not

                        Equipment was observed in four bivouac areas north, south, east and west of

                    <p>2. Summary. Except for the expression of a strong interest in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> development assistance, I did not succeed
                        in soliciting from President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> any
                        specific suggestions of steps the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> or
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might take in the interest of
                        improving our bilateral relationship. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> did, however, emphasize his personal desire for an
                        improvement of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations and in
                        this connection referred to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s
                        forebearance in not making any public criticism of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He claimed the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s foreign policy decisions, e.g., rupture of relations with
                        South Korea, had been taken completely on its own, without any consultation
                        with the Soviets; maintained that aid from the Soviet Union was given
                        without strings or preconditions; and disavowed any intention of aggression
                        against neighboring countries. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        defended the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> on human rights grounds by
                        attacking the record of the Zahir and Daoud regimes. I left with the
                        impression that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> welcomed the
                        current, less confrontational relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>; that he was not seriously pressing for any early concrete
                        steps by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, as in economic
                        assistance; and that he would be content for the time being with a polite
                        but limited relationship which both countries would refrain from
                        exacerbating by word or action. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations. I had forty minutes
                        alone with President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>
                        on the morning of Oct. 27. After the photographs were taken, we got down
                        speedily to business. Following the talking points proposed in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, I mentioned those recent areas
                        (Ariana DC–10, narcotics control, etc.) where we had found we could work
                        cooperatively with the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> in our mutual
                        interest and with a view to improving our bilateral relationship. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> did not comment on any of the examples
                        I cited, but merely nodded his assent. He then went on, with considerable
                        eloquence, to stress his personal commitment to improving <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations, expressing his affection
                        for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                            Trifonov, Political Counselor of the Soviet Embassy, October 25, in
                            Washington. This meeting was reported in telegram 277944 to Kabul,
                            October 25. (Department of Defense, Afghan War Collection, Box 4, <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in Afghanistan (10–31 Oct 79)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> made a particular point of
                        drawing my attention to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s
                        forebearance in refraining from public attacks on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Even when Afghanistan is attacked by
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, he said, we have deliberately
                        resisted the temptation to respond in kind. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> does not want to do anything to “blacken the name or fame
                        of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>” He said that each country must
                        act in in its own interest but was confident that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Afghanistan could continue to find
                        ways and means that could serve their own interests but be of mutual
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> customarily publicizes the
                        courtesy calls of foreign diplomats on <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. My call was the first item on the English and Dari TV
                        newscasts Oct. 27.</p>
                    <p>5. Development assistance. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> made a
                        strong pitch for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> “material assistance.”
                        Afghanistan, he said, is in desperate need of foreign aid. Even a small
                        portion of the development assistance which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> provides worldwide would be of very great help to
                        Afghanistan. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> would be grateful for
                        any assistance, no matter how small. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said he would be happy to publicize <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid to Afghanistan, adding that he would
                        like to see more buildings in Afghanistan with plaques denoting that they
                        had been built through <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid. He allowed
                        as how “your philosophy” can make it difficult for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to help in some areas and “our philosophy”
                        makes it difficult for Afghanistan to accept some kinds of aid. Still, he
                        said, we could doubtless find areas where we could work together.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> pretended to express
                        bewilderment as to why more <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid is not
                        forthcoming. Referring to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commercial
                        investment in the Soviet Union, he said that surely the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has more problems with the Soviet Union
                        than with Afghanistan. Somewhat slyly he said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress is prepared to give ten million dollars to
                        so-called Afghan refugees in Pakistan but is not willing to contribute to
                        alleviating the root cause of the problem, poverty and underdevelopment in
                        Afghanistan itself.</p>
                    <p>7. When I noted the practical barrier posed by the <persName corresp="#p_PC_1">Pell</persName>-Stone Amendment to the continuation of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> development assistance, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said he had felt great animosity on
                        the part of the Americans with whom he had talked in the days after
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName>’s death.<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">See <ref target="#d68fn4">footnote 4, Document
                            68</ref>.</note> It was unfortunate, he said, how much misunderstanding
                        had arisen, <pb n="220" facs="0265" xml:id="pg_220"/>implying that the
                        misunderstanding was primarily on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        side. Neither <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s words nor
                        demeanor suggested that he was prepared to consider any formula which would
                        recognize <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> responsibility for the
                        Ambassador’s death. As for the security of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> personnel in Afghanistan, said <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, you have nothing to fear. “Nobody is out to kill
                        Americans.”</p>
                    <p>8. Non-alignment. After saying that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        hoped to be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue about the differences
                        between our countries, I noted our concern that Afghanistan’s previous
                        genuine non-alignment now appears to have gone by the board and merged into
                        positions which to us seem virtually indistinguishable from those of the
                        Soviet Union and Cuba. As examples, I cited the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s rupture of relations with South Korea and the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> position on Puerto Rico.<note n="5" xml:id="d78fn5">In telegram 7538 from Kabul, September 19, 1978, the
                            Embassy reported the Afghan Government’s decision to sever its relations
                            with South Korea in protest of the ongoing presence of foreign troops in
                            South Korea and out of a desire to see the reunification of Korea under
                            the control of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. (National
                            Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy
                            File, D780383–0515) In telegram 7858 from Kabul, September 28, 1978, the
                            Embassy noted that Afghanistan was “firmly wedded” to the Iraqi-Cuban
                            resolution on Puerto Rico at the United Nations Committee of 24 session
                            of 1978, which called for the independence of Puerto Rico. (National
                            Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy
                            File, D780395–1068)</note> In reply, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s
                        decisions with respect to South Korea, its suspension of relations with
                        Egypt and its recognition of the Polisario had been taken without
                        consultation with any country. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said, the Soviet Union had been taken unawares by these
                        decisions.</p>
                    <p>9. Following up on the mention of South Korea, I asked <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> if he heard the news that President
                        Park had been killed the previous night. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said he had not heard of it. I described the shooting
                        in a way to suggest to him a parallel between the shoot-out in Kabul on
                        Sept. 14 which had left him the undisputed ruler of the Saur revolution. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> felt any collegial
                        association with Park, he did not show it. He merely said that “terrorism is
                        to be deplored wherever it occurs.”</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said Soviet aid to
                        Afghanistan was given without strings or preconditions. The Soviet Union has
                        never asked Afghanistan to take any action which would adversely affect
                        Afghan relations with any other country, whether it be the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, India, Pakistan, Iran or China. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> himself should ask him
                        to take any action against Afghan independence, said <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, he would not hesitate “to sacrifice
                        even one second of his life” in opposition to such a request.</p>
                    <p>11. Extent of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. When I said that another of
                        our concerns was the growing Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> replied that Soviet aid was increasing

                            relayed in telegram 5923 from Kabul, October 9. The report painted a
                            grim picture of the state of human rights in Afghanistan, noting the
                            commonplace practice of torture and atrocities visited upon Afghan
                            villagers by the Afghan military. (Department of Defense, Afghan War

                        problems impacting on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> attacked the human rights
                        record of the previous Zahir and Daoud regimes. The Saur revolution, he
                        said, had overthrown a regime which had existed for the profit and
                        well-being of one family. Ninety-eight percent of the people had been
                        sacrificed for this one family. Under Mohammedzai rule many people had been
                        imprisoned, tortured and executed, but not once had the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> raised its voice in protest. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> said he could categorically assert
                        that not one person would be imprisoned or executed if foreign interference
                        in Afghanistan would cease. With a twisted grin, he said he found it
                        surprising that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, a staunch believer
                        in religious freedom, would be concerned about the so-called non-Islamic
                        nature of the Afghan regime which was only trying for the first time in
                        history to permit all Afghans to practice any religion or non-religion they
                        chose.</p>
                    <p>13. Impressions. The man is impressive. His survival to date is by itself
                        impressive, as is the air of quiet self-confidence he exudes. Clearly, he is
                        aware of the mortality rate of Afghan leaders; several times he said “even
                        if I am killed tomorrow.” He masks his ruthlessness and toughness quite well
                        by his soft-spoken manner. In remarkable contrast to his turgid public
                        speeches, his private discourse is refreshingly free from Marxist cant and
                        clichés. His English is quite good and very easy to understand. Only once
                        did he seem to have difficulty in expressing himself and that was when,
                        perhaps in an attempt to convey great sincerity, he was declaiming how he
                        could never sacrifice Afghan independence to any foreign demands, including
                        from the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>14. I think he wants an improvement in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan relations. His reasons could be varied: Soviet
                        coaching; a long-range hedge against over-dependence on the Soviet Union;
                        concern over the trouble which open <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        animosity can create for his regime; conversely, an interest in bringing
                        about the doubts and confusion which friendlier <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations could sow among the supporters of the
                        insurgency, the Pakistanis, Iranians and Saudis; a genuinely felt need for
                        economic assistance.</p>
                    <p><pb n="222" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_222"/>15. I do not think that in the near
                        future <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> realistically expects any
                        substantial forward movement in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Afghan
                        relations, such as the resumption of aid. My guess is that he will be
                        content for the time being with the less rancorous discourse we are having
                        with his government, agreeing to avoid confrontational actions provided we
                        do the same. In this connection he seconded with some alacrity my
                        observations that sometimes two countries can work toward a better
                        relationship simply by refraining from doing each other mischief. Perhaps,
                        this is all we should strive for, as we assess <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s staying power both vis-à-vis the Soviets and the
                        insurgents and as we try to maintain a limited presence toward the time when
                        there might once again be some scope for a larger and more active <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in Afghanistan.</p>

                            October 16–17. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> pledged:
                            “in the event of aggression from Afghanistan against Pakistan the United

                    <p>2. I made the démarche on Pakistan and Afghanistan, using the talking points
                        in para 3 of <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, when I called on
                        First Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> this morning (November 2).</p>
                    <p>3. In responding, <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> first
                        said that the Soviets favored normal and improving relations between
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan and had in fact said so to the leaders of both
                        countries. For their <pb n="223" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_223"/>part, the
                        leadership of Afghanistan, as is known, had also expressed readiness to
                        improve relations with Pakistan and had taken concrete steps in that
                        direction; he had in mind the visit to Pakistan by Deputy Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM_1">Dost</persName> and the invitation for the
                        President of Pakistan to visit Afghanistan. From the other side, however,
                        although the Pakistani leadership had earlier expressed interest in a high
                        level meeting, it subsequently was avoiding such a meeting.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> did not directly
                        address the question of charges of Pakistani interference in Afghanistan’s
                        internal affairs, but spoke instead of the use of Pakistani territory for
                        hostile actions against Afghanistan. That this was going on was not
                        something invented by the media. It was openly admitted by leaders of the
                        insurgents, who made public statements about their activities and made no
                        secret of the fact that they were operating against Afghanistan from
                        Pakistan territory.</p>
                    <p>5. As for the question of the “involvement” of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> continued, the Soviet Union had even earlier
                        provided aid—and was now doing so on an even larger scale—to the Afghanistan
                        people and state; all forms of aid were included—economic and scientific and
                        technological, and other forms, including military. But all this assistance,
                        regardless of type, was being given at the request of the Government of
                        Afghanistan, and there were no political conditions attached. It did not
                        constitute interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. The
                        questions which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was raising about
                        this aid, by referring to the presence of Soviet specialists and advisers as
                        though this raised concerns on the part of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, were not legitimate questions. In essence, this amounted
                        to interference in the relations between two sovereign states, since Soviet
                        aid was given at the request of the legitimate Afghan Government.</p>
                    <p>6. Picking up the reference to the nuclear issue, <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> said he could confirm what had
                        been previously said by the Soviet side, that Pakistan activity toward the
                        development of a nuclear device was also of concern to the Soviet Union. The
                        Soviets had put questions to the Pakistani leadership on this score, and
                        they would be prepared to continue to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in this matter, on the basis of our mutual
                        interest in preventing proliferation.</p>

                    <p>On 30 October you directed me to take soundings with Pakistani and Saudi
                        intelligence agencies on their intentions for covert action in Afghanistan.
                        I understood that you wanted to know what the degree of their commitment
                        would be were we to join with them in such endeavors. We have taken such
                        soundings. The results are summarized below:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pakistan:</p>
                    <p>There is no question that Pakistan—without waiting for us—is already
                        supporting the Afghan tribesmen. The head of Pakistani military intelligence
                        has made it clear that President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        holds the continuation of the tribal insurgency to be vital to his country’s
                        security and that support in the way of weapons, ammunition and explosives
                        is essential to sustain the insurgency. (The Pakistanis have been pressing
                        us for weapons and ammunition since early August.)</p>
                    <p>Our relations with Pakistan are not warm enough for us to elicit details on
                        what type and how much support they are providing or would provide in a
                        joint effort. Clearly they do not have large financial resources for such an
                        undertaking.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Opinion:</hi> Pakistan will cooperate in covert action
                        against Afghanistan. It will be anxious that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> involvement not invite strong Soviet responses. It will be
                        nervous that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cooperation might be
                        terminated abruptly if <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan
                        relations should deteriorate over other issues. Overall, Pakistan can be
                        counted on for operational support for joint efforts, but cannot be looked
                        upon to take the lead or to supply resources.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Saudi Arabia:</p>
                    <p>The Saudi chief of intelligence states that his government is committed to
                        assisting the Afghan insurgents and that some monies have been disbursed to
                        refugees resident in Pakistan. The Saudis, however, are <pb n="225" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_225"/>confused as to the relative merits of the

                        and make a judgment as to the strengths and weaknesses of the tribesmen.</p>
                    <p>On three separate occasions the intelligence chief said that his government
                        would react positively to secret <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        proposals on support to the insurgents. The Saudis, however, are concerned

                        will to engage in political action and they are not sanguine that we will
                        become involved to any significant extent. As a result of this attitude we
                        were unable to obtain an estimate of how much money the Saudis would likely
                        commit to such a program.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Opinion:</hi> I think we have pushed the Saudis as far as
                        we can push them at this point. The Saudis lack general intelligence
                        capability, so their confusion is understandable. As in many other areas, it
                        will be necessary for us to lead the Saudis by the hand in getting them to
                        make a firm decision. Nevertheless, the Saudis appear willing to put up
                        resources once we make a firm commitment. I therefore suggest that the
                        finding be signed and that we be authorized to tell the Saudis we will put
                        up [<hi rend="italic">amount not declassified</hi>] (less the amount for
                        communications equipment) and expect them to put up at least as much.<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">The Finding was signed on November 7; see <ref target="#d76fn1">footnote 1, Document 76</ref>.</note> We will then
                        work with them and the Paks in assessing the capabilities of the various
                        groups and the degree of support which should be given to each.</p>
                    <p>Should the Saudi’s delay too long or back off for one reason or another, we
                        can then reconsider whether to continue our unilateral program.</p>

                    <p>I appreciate your asking my views on this issue. I don’t share <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Bob Komer</persName>’s reservations:</p>
                    <p>1. It is, I think, very much in our interest that we keep the Afghanistan
                        insurgency going. It would be a major blow if heavier Soviet involvement led
                        to a clear Kabul victory and the petering out of the resistance. Indeed, it
                        would mean that the Soviets had been able to do for <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> what no one had ever been able to do
                        for a Kabul government. On the plus side, if the insurgency keeps going, the
                        various rebel factions may be persuaded to get together. Clearly they won’t
                        if things go badly. Even if they don’t, they may be able to make life
                        difficult for Moscow’s Kabul clients even disunited if they have reasonable
                        outside support.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">In the left margin beside this
                            paragraph, an unknown hand, likely <persName corresp="#p_MDJ_1">Murphy</persName>’s, wrote: “All true but . . . question is whether
                            [illegible].”</note></p>
                    <p>2. It is the Soviet backyard, but it is also an area where the status quo
                        ante is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> having a puppet regime. Our objective is
                        certainly not the unattainable one of installing people in Kabul we can
                        control, but of continuing a situation in which the Soviets, having
                        installed (or more likely connived at installing) a friendly regime find
                        it’s not much more than the Kabul garrison instead of a strong central
                        government.</p>
                    <p>3. I’m all for saving assets for promising opportunities, and that would be
                        decisive against larger scale actions, but I think a modest US investment of
                        funds (and some arms) would be more likely to pay off here than elsewhere
                        (see para 4 below). (Having written that, it occurs to me that Bob may mean
                        the <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss> should save his assets for
                        more <pb n="227" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_227"/>promising interventions with
                        the White House. Since I don’t know why the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> (I) turned down the original proposal, I can’t assess how
                        much of a reopening the issue requires.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">See <ref target="#d76">Document 76</ref>. The Presidential Finding did not
                            include a provision to support the Afghan insurgents with military
                            supplies. In the left margin beside this paragraph an unknown hand,
                            likely <persName corresp="#p_MDJ_1">Murphy</persName>’s, wrote: “Also my
                            points.”</note> I think he could raise it noncommittally at a <gloss target="#t_BVB_1">BVB</gloss> lunch, without risking much.)</p>
                    <p>4. The fact that the Paks and the Iranians are already helping seems to me an
                        argument for some modestly increased US effort, rather than the reverse. We
                        have learned over the years that we can’t easily affect complicated distant
                        local conflicts operating from here—but that we can have some impact when we
                        can reinforce local concerns. (In current circumstances, being on the same
                        side as the Ayatollah seems strange, but someday we may want to be able to
                        remind them that the Shah wasn’t opposed to the Soviets as a way of being
                        nice to the US but because the US can be a helpful ally against Soviet
                        adventures.) In the current state of our relations with Pakistan, being able
                        to cooperate in this is a useful way of making clear that we have—and can
                        follow through on—some common security concerns. <hi rend="italic">In fact,
                            in my view a principal argument for somewhat increased US support is the
                            beneficial impact on other countries (Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, even
                            China) rather than our impact on events in Afghanistan itself.</hi><note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">In the left margin beside this paragraph, an

                    <p>In short, I think we should adhere to the policy that I believe was adopted
                        some months ago: Do what is appropriate to keep the insurrection going,
                        working with others in the region. I can’t comment on specific plans because
                        I don’t know enough about what’s been proposed, but if it’s feasible, I’d
                        favor funds for arms and facilitating services to locate them and get them
                        there.</p>

                        Real Strains in Soviet-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        Relationship May Have Flowed From September 14 Shootout.</p>
                    <p>1. (S—Entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: The leadership of the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan
                            (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) has been circulating an
                        “official” version of the events of September 14 for use in briefing party
                        cadre. We have no doubt concerning the document’s authenticity, and its
                        contents, therefore, should be regarded as current strongman <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>’s view of the “truth”
                        surrounding September 14. The document’s clear condemnation of the Soviet
                        role—in the person of now departed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>—in the affair tends to confirm widespread rumors
                        here that there may be strains in the Soviet-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> relationship resulting from the September 14 shootout.
                        Moreover, the fact that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is
                        virtually openly circulating the document among his party cadre suggests he
                        wants to get a message to his Soviet mentors that he is wary of their past
                        (and presumably future) intentions toward him.</p>
                    <p>3. On the domestic scene, various themes within the document echo theses
                        which the current leadership has repeated often since September 14, most
                        notably that it was the late President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his henchmen, and not <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>, who were primarily responsible for the
                        repressive policies of this revolutionary government. Few Afghans appear to
                        swallow this particular line, however, and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> remains the generally perceived villain and despot. In
                        fact, the picture of the Khalqi leadership which emerges from this party
                        document resembles a group of thugs who could shame the Mafia, rather than
                        an enlightened leadership attempting to establish “security, legality, and
                        justice” in Afghanistan. End of summary.</p>
                    <p>4. The extraordinary and lengthy document (almost thirty pages in
                        translation) essentially recounts the background leading up to the September
                        14, 1979, shootout between supporters of current President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> and the late <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Noor Mohammad Taraki</persName>, as well as some
                        details surrounding that event itself. Beyond this, however, the document’s
                        direct charges that now departed Soviet Ambassador Alexander <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> (and his senior advisors) was
                        instrumental in luring <pb n="229" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_229"/><persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> into a potentially fatal trap, that
                        the Soviet envoy was at the scene of the gunfight, and that the men
                        allegedly plotting <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s death found
                        a safe haven in the Soviet Embassy at one point during the drama, underscore
                        why any existing tensions in the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>-Moscow relationship may need some time to be
                        dissipated.</p>
                    <p>5. Highlights of the document’s remarkable tale are:</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his group of “henchmen”
                        (former Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Mohammad Aslam
                            Watanjar</persName>, former Interior Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJ_1">Sher Jan Mazdooryar</persName>, former Communications
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GSM_1">Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoi</persName>,
                        and former secret police chief Assadullah Sarwari; all military men now
                        either dead, incarcerated, or at large) had hatched a plot to kill <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. Ostensible reasons behind the plot
                        were that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, from the beginning of
                        the revolution, had resisted their plan to build a “massive cult of
                        personality” around <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, and
                        because the late Afghan President had become upset at <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s “growing popularity” among the

                        anti-revolutionary machinations of the “<persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName> gang” went unheeded because <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> wanted <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> eliminated permanently;</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> loyalists among the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> cadre learned of the plot to kill him,
                        and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> began arguing within the
                        party that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s plots, spying,
                        and repression were having adverse effects on the progress of the
                        revolution;</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was supposed to be killed at
                        Kabul’s airport upon <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s return
                        from the nonaligned summit in Havana in early September, but an <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> informer, Aziz Ahmad Akbari (recently
                        appointed Ambassador to Iraq) was a member of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> entourage, and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, notified of the danger, was able to
                        avoid the supposed assassins;</p>
                    <p>—a <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> confrontation on September 12 led to heated exchanges,
                        with <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> calling for a Central
                        Committee plenum to mediate matters, and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> claiming that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had made a mess of the revolution;</p>
                    <p>—by September 13, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was afraid to
                        go to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s office, since he
                        believed the <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName> gang and
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> would kill him. On the
                        evening of September 13, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        received word that the <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>
                        “gang of four” had been sent by <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> to seek refuge in the Soviet Embassy, and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, with his heavily armed bodyguards,
                        went to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s office where
                        further accusations and threats were exchanged;</p>
                    <p>—Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> and “three
                        high-ranking advisors” arrived at the September 13 evening shouting match
                        bringing an “oral message” from President <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> stressing that “unity among Afghan leaders was in
                        the interest of the revolution”;</p>
                    <p><pb n="230" facs="0275" xml:id="pg_230"/>—after <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> and his entourage left the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName> ordered the army to move against
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> in order to protect
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, but unit commanders
                        refused to obey such orders;</p>
                    <p>—on the morning of September 14, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        engaged in another shouting match, this one by phone, over who controlled
                        the military, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> as
                        Commander-in-Chief, or <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> as
                        Minister of Defense. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> ordered
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to come to the President’s
                        office, but <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s closest advisors
                        (the “martyred” <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Seyed Daoud Taroon</persName>,
                        then police commandant, and Lt. Col. Yaqoub, now Chief of the General Staff)
                        warned <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> it was not safe for him
                        to go to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s office;</p>
                    <p>—on the fateful afternoon of September 14, <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> and his three advisors arrived in <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s office and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> by phone that our “Soviet comrades” wanted <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to come to the Palace for talks.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName> advised <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> that the presence of the Soviets in
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s office precluded
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and his men from opening
                        fire on <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>;</p>
                    <p>—shortly thereafter, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, accompanied
                        by his own guards, arrived at the Palace, was met by <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>, and they proceeded up a staircase
                        toward <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s office. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s guards immediately opened fire
                        killing <persName corresp="#p_TSD_1">Taroon</persName>, who was in front of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, instantly, while <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> rolled out of the line of fire leading
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s men to think he had
                        been hit. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and some of his guards
                        successfully made their escape;</p>
                    <p>—on September 15th, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> convened
                        meetings of the party’s Politburo and the Cabinet, and on the 16th meetings
                        of the party Central Committee and the Revolutionary Council. These meetings
                        took the “necessary decisions” expelling <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> from the party for hatching the plot to kill
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and for other “unprincipled
                        acts.” <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Watanjar</persName>, et al., were also
                        expelled and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was elected to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s posts;</p>
                    <p>—the above decisions ended the era of “one-man rule and personality cult,”
                        and opened a new chapter in the development of the party and the
                        revolution.</p>
                    <p>6. Comment: Aside from giving some fascinating insights into the bloody ways
                        “democracy” operates in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, this party
                        document possesses other nuggets of potential political value. The fact that
                        it is being circulated among party leaders with instructions to brief their
                        cadre about its contents, indicates clearly that this version is the
                        officially-sanctioned <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> version of
                        what happened on September 14, and why. In this regard, the allegations that
                            <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName> and his senior advisors
                        indirectly summoned <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s lair in order to be gunned down,
                        that the Soviets were unable or unwilling to prevent <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s men from opening fire, and that
                        the Soviet Embassy sheltered the men who were leading the plot aimed at
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, tend to substantiate
                        widespread post-September 14 rumors here that definite strains exist in
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and that these strains will not be
                        easily dispelled. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s willingness
                        to <pb n="231" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_231"/>circulate a document containing
                        charges along these lines strongly suggests that he wants Moscow to get the
                        message that he is wary of their past (and presumably future) intentions
                        toward him. Whether those strains led directly to <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>’s transfer is not yet known, but
                        that possibility should not be discarded. Whatever the case, <persName corresp="#p_PAM_1">Puzanov</persName>’s newly-arrived successor, for
                        several reasons, will have his hands full.</p>
                    <p>7. On the domestic front, the general themes of the story track with
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s overall theses he has
                        espoused since his accession to power. For example, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s cult of personality and abuses of
                        office had brought the revolution to the brink of collapse, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s excessive repression was in
                        direct contrast to <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s alleged
                        desire to adopt a legal constitution in order to guarantee “security,
                        legality, and justice,” and the end of one-man rule paved the way for a
                        “golden revolutionary future” in Afghanistan. Although <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and his closest cohorts have played
                        these themes repeatedly since September 14, few Afghans apparently discern
                        much substantive difference between the goals and tactics of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, and the latter, despite his loudest protestations, is
                        still viewed by most as a cruel despot who has been the principal architect
                        of this repressive regime. In fact, the picture of the Khalqi leadership
                        that emerges from this particular party document resembles a group of
                        political thugs using tactics that would shame Chicago of the 1920s in their
                        high-stakes struggle for political survival.</p>

                        <item>This is a field appraisal. It presents the views of this Agency’s
                            senior officer on the scene. It is an interpretation based on previously
                            reported information. Prepared primarily for internal Agency use, it is
                            disseminated in the belief that it may be useful to others in their own
                            assessment of the situation.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. We believe the current buildup of Soviet forces reflects a continuing
                        deterioration in the situation for the Afghan military and Government. The
                        Afghan military has suffered a series of reverses in the last several weeks.
                        Additionally, the government’s successful October offensive in Paktia has
                        largely now been negated by recent events there. Badakhshan is in a
                        precarious position. The situation elsewhere between Kabul and the northeast
                        border is deteriorating. The rebels are again active in Paktia and Qandahar
                        areas. Nightly, both Herat and Qandahar cities are the scenes of rebel
                        activity and assassinations and the fighting is creeping closer to Kabul.
                        Additionally, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> is no longer able to
                        meet its manpower requirements and continues to experience desertions from
                        its forces. We would assume that, given the above, there is a note of
                        desperation at the People’s House and a general fear among the Khalqis and
                        their Soviet supporters that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        military position could quickly crumble, leaving Kabul exposed to a
                        successful insurgent attack and/or a general breakdown in the law-and-order
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>2. Another possibility and only partially connected to the above is that the
                        Soviets are getting ready to remove <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. It seems evident that the Soviets are committed to supporting the
                        revolution here. Our sources tell us that they will forward whatever
                        supplies are needed to do this. Increasingly, we are receiving rumors that
                        the Soviets are directly engaged in combat operations. On 11 December, a
                        third-country diplomat told us that he has a senior Khalqi <pb n="234" facs="0279" xml:id="pg_234"/>source who says that Soviet combat troops
                        are involved in combat operations. Previous reporting from Paktia Province
                        during the October offensive supports the premise that Soviet troops were
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>4. It is clear that the Soviets are actively, aggressively engaged in
                        suppressing the insurgency; that they will take whatever steps are necessary
                        to do this. While we do not know whether they will be successful, we do know
                        that the insurgents, in the past, have been unable to exploit favorable
                        opportunities their successes have presented to them.</p>
                    <p>5. We believe the Soviets have undertaken the resupply of Afghan troops by
                        air because they perceive that they are in an emergency situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">The Soviet airlift was first reported in [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] December 7. The report
                            surmised that the airlift “may have been prompted by a major rebel
                            offensive in the valley north of Kabul,” and would “probably be viewed
                            by many as an intervention” and “provide a focus for religious outrage
                            over a perceived Soviet move against brother Muslims, perhaps led by
                            Iran,” or even the Afghan military. The airlift constituted a “serious
                            escalation” in Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and it demonstrated
                            that the situation was more dire than current intelligence reporting
                            suggested. “Most importantly,” the report concluded, the airlift
                            “demonstrates Moscow’s resolve in pursuing its interests in Afghanistan
                            despite the obvious pitfalls and at a time when the Kremlin might
                            consider the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> preoccupied with
                            events in Tehran.” (Department of Defense, Afghan War Collection, Box 4,
                            Afghan Situation Folder, Start 14 Sep)</note> The road connecting the
                        Soviet port of Termez to Kabul, while occasionally interdicted, is open. The
                        road system from the Soviet border to Herat is open. Therefore, if there
                        were no emergency, the Soviets could augment and resupply forces here by
                        road. We believe the Soviet decision to send troops in by air and to
                        resupply Afghan forces by air is a reflection of their evaluation that the
                        situation is deteriorating. The number of resupply flights to Kabul and
                        Bagram between 29 November and 4 December was 17, of which 13 were AN–22
                        flights and 4 were AN–12 flights. (An AN–22 carries 176,000 pounds of cargo
                        or about 400 men when modified and an AN–12 carries 44,000 pounds of cargo.)
                        Subsequent to this, additional AN–22 and AN–12 flights have arrived in
                        Afghanistan. The exact number is unknown at this time. Also, there has been
                        an increase in the TU–154 flights into Kabul. We are witnessing a major
                        Soviet military/civilian airlift into and out of Afghanistan.</p>

                        of the comments made in this appraisal, I have asked the Defense Attaché,
                        and <gloss target="#t_ADCM_1">A/DCM</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss>/ECON section officer Taylor to add their own views to the
                        above report. My own comments follow theirs.</p>
                    <p>A. <gloss target="#t_DATT_1">DATT</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] comment: I share the view that the present
                        insurgency situation in-country gives grounds for Soviet alarm. The Afghan
                        Army has been unable to successfully <pb n="235" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_235"/>achieve its objectives in its recent large counterinsurgency operations,
                        and it now appears to be struggling to maintain the status quo. Were <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces to experience a significant
                        setback, such as the fall of Feyzabad (capital of Badakhshan Province), this
                        could well trigger large-scale desertions and unit defections, not only in
                        the north, but elsewhere. The Soviets are most certainly aware of the poor
                        state and low morale of Afghan troops. Actual troop strength in many units
                        appears to be below that of three months ago. Thus, I believe the recent
                        action to augment the airlift of cargo and personnel to Afghanistan is a
                        reflection of their concern about this worsened situation.</p>
                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_ADCM_1">A/DCM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss>/ECON section chief (Freres) comment: I agree that the
                        Soviets are probably worried about the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime’s ability to cope with the insurgency,
                        notwithstanding all of the Soviet logistic and advisory support given
                        heretofore. I do not believe, though, that the buildup of Soviet forces in
                        Afghanistan reflects a Soviet estimate that the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime is about to fall, nor do any of those commenting
                        here believe that the regime’s collapse is imminent. Rather, in my view, the
                        Soviets’ objective is primarily to safeguard its interests in Afghanistan by
                        enabling themselves to intervene promptly and physically with troops should
                        they perceive that this is required. Secondarily, the Soviets may be looking
                        beyond Afghan borders for targets of opportunity, such as in Iranian and
                        Pakistani Baluchistan. If so, it would seem prudent for them to strengthen
                        their position in Afghanistan now.</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss>/ECON section (Taylor) comment: In the
                        short run, the recent upsurge of direct Soviet involvement could be designed
                        to insure the survival of the regime in Kabul and other key areas until the
                        arrival of winter. Cold weather and heavy snows will presumably dampen
                        military activities in general, and could provide a respite for the regime
                        to prepare for next spring’s campaign. A crucial unknown factor, however,
                        will be the magnitude of Soviet “emergency support” necessary to buy the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> some breathing space.</p>
                    <p>D. Chargé’s comment: I don’t fully share the Agency senior officer’s and
                            <gloss target="#t_DATT_1">DATT</gloss>’s conclusion that the current
                        buildup of Soviet forces reflects a recent deterioration in the position of
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> military and Government. I
                        appreciate, however, that this is the most plausible reason for the buildup.
                        I also appreciate that there has recently been some evacuation of Soviet
                        dependents from Kabul, and that Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        personnel have evinced nervousness about their dependents. On the other
                        hand, the insurgents have in recent weeks not scored any dramatic success in
                        the field except in the sense that they have held <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces at bay in several areas, turned back <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces near Bamian and relieving columns
                        approaching Feyzabad (Badakhshan) and Taqab (Parwan), and reestablished
                        their previous countryside dominance in Paktia. But the overall situation
                        does not seem much different from <pb n="236" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_236"/>that of three months ago except in <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        Army unit strengths. Furthermore, there has been no real military threat
                        posed yet to Kabul, the political heart of the country. My own surmise about
                        the Soviet buildup is that it was decided upon a month or so ago as a
                        precautionary contingency measure to bolster the regime and protect Soviet
                        personnel in Kabul should there be a major <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> military force collapse in the field.</p>
                    <p>I don’t share the Agency senior officer’s surmise that the buildup is related
                        to possible Soviet plans to remove <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName>. The Soviets must appreciate that there is no Afghan
                        Communist waiting in the wings who seemingly can match <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s abilities, and that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> ostensibly fully supports the Soviets
                        special position in Afghanistan and Soviet foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_ADCM_1">A/DCM</gloss>’s surmise that the Soviet
                        troop buildup in country may be related to events in Iran, Baluchistan,
                        etc., I am not sure. I believe it is solely related to events in Afghanistan
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the case, we are in the midst of an interesting and potentially
                        critical stage of the insurgency. Were the insurgents to bring about the
                        surrender of a provincial capital or major town, this would be a major
                        psychological blow to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. This bears
                        on what could well be the Achilles Heel of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>: lack of military manpower. Most <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> units are already far understrength. Since 85 percent of
                        the country’s population is rural, were the regime to lose control of almost
                        all of that countryside (which is now mostly the case), they will be
                        hard-pressed to overcome the insurgency. End Chargé’s comment.</p>

                    <p>1. I left the meeting on Afghanistan yesterday with the feeling that we had
                        not accomplished much in the way of sharpening the Community perception of
                        what the Soviets may be about in Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">The
                            meeting was not further identified and no record of it was found.</note>
                        Other than myself, most of those present seemed to continue to hold the view
                        that the Soviets are moving tentatively with regard to their options in
                        Afghanistan. E.g.,</p>
                    <p>—They are setting up an enclave at Bagram to ensure that they have a base
                        through which to either evacuate their advisors or insert more troops and
                        material, whichever move is dictated by the evolution of a situation which
                        is now uncertain.</p>
                    <p>—They have decided to bolster the defenses of Bagram in response to increased
                        insurgent probes.</p>
                    <p>—They need some troops to protect their people against a massacre if the
                        situation suddenly deteriorates.</p>
                    <p>—Etc.</p>
                    <p>2. None of these actions, however, is likely to change the course of events
                        in Afghanistan that is causing the Soviets grief. Yet there seemed to be a
                        glimmer of consensus among those at the meeting that the act of sending
                        their own combat units into another country in the midst of an insurgency
                        reflects a significant political decision on the part of the Soviets. Why
                        then should we shrink from believing that the Soviets—having crossed this
                        threshold—will employ these troops in some way to tangibly impact on the
                        situation that caused the threshold to be crossed.</p>
                    <p>3. The decision in this case was made with the benefit of a thorough (60 plus
                        days) on-the-scene study of all aspects of the situation by a mission of
                        high level authorities. (The <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName> mission.)<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">See <ref target="#d62fn3">footnote 3, Document 62</ref>.</note> We know from
                        the composition of the study group and the activities in which <pb n="238" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_238"/>they were engaged while in Afghanistan that
                        their review went into the logistics of the situation, the effectiveness of
                        such organs as the police, intelligence, the ministerial level offices, and
                        communications security. A main feature of this study certainly must have
                        been an assessment of the course of the insurgency and the ability of the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces—military and political—to
                        deal with it.</p>
                    <p>4. Our own assessment shows an Afghan army which is having great difficulty
                        in maintaining its manpower strength, experiencing erosion of morale leading
                        to desertions, mutinies, and outright defections. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces have produced no lasting gains
                        against the insurgents. They have been able to win most pitched battles—when
                        the insurgents permit a pitched battle to occur—but cannot consolidate
                        gains. Among the reasons for this inability are (a) the shrinking strength
                        of the armed forces, which forces them to be constantly shifting forces to
                        meet the various outbreaks and thus allowing rebel forces to seep back into
                        areas from which they had been driven, and (b) the deterioration of morale
                        in <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces left to hold the positions
                        gained by military action. At the heart of the problem is a regime rent by
                        factionalism, for which mutiny is a constant problem, and which is
                        demonstrably unable to promote the kind of cohesion and efficiency in its
                        own military and political machinery that would be needed to deal
                        effectively with the insurgency. What all this adds up to is a situation
                        that could fly apart at any time, with a revolt of the armed forces being
                        the most serious potential problem.</p>
                    <p>5. Moreover, the prognosis is that things will continue to go downhill.
                        During last winter, a mild one, the insurgency gained strength. This summer,
                        analysts both in Embassy Kabul and here in Washington forecast that if the
                        regime could survive until winter the insurgents would have to pull back and
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces could pull themselves
                        together. The reverse appears to be happening. It is the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces that seem to be pulling back and
                        the insurgents who are gaining. The largest <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> offensive of the insurgency has recently been completed,
                        yet the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces ultimately pulled back
                        and the rebels seeped back into the areas from which they had been driven by
                        the offensive. The action must clearly be seen as proof that advisors and
                        technicians, logistical support, and tactical guidance is not going to turn
                        the situation around.</p>
                    <p>6. The <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName> mission had ample
                        opportunity to study the situation first hand, and in all likelihood came to
                        the same conclusion. The decision which led to the actions we are beginning
                        to see would have been made on the basis of a dismal assessment of the
                        present situation and of its likely course if something were not done about
                        it, together with an evaluation by a team of high level authorities as to
                        what would have to be done if the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        wanted to solidify its politico-strategic objectives in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><pb n="239" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_239"/>7. We believe that the Soviet
                        actions since <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName>’s departure
                        indicate that Moscow decided to act to save its position. Steps such as
                        securing an enclave against future contingencies for evacuation and
                        providing protection to Soviet citizens could not be perceived by the
                        Soviets as “doing” anything about the situation. Indeed, such actions are
                        more consistent with a lack of decision. In view of the prognosis, they
                        amount to conceding to the probability of losing out and merely covering the
                        exit. Even if the enclave were for the purpose of ensuring an entrance point
                        for troops, merely holding an enclave would not change the deteriorating
                        situation which created the potential need for troops. In effect, doing
                        nothing more than holding an enclave against the potential need to land
                        troops would make it likely that sooner or later the enclave would have to
                        be used for just that purpose. “Wait and see” does not appear to be the
                        objective of the course indicated by the recent Soviet actions.</p>
                    <p>8. “Doing something” about the situation means, in effect, ensuring that the
                        next time the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces, with Soviet help,
                        undertake a large offensive against the insurgents they will not be forced
                        to give back their winnings. This requires more military forces than the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> can muster at present. Someone must
                        hold the cities, main centers, airfields, and keep the roads open. Military
                        forces are required to ensure the security of Kabul, both from revolts from
                        within and from attacks by the insurgents. One of the reasons for the
                        military failure and eroding morale of the Afghan armed forces to date is
                        that they cannot accomplish all these things and to the Afghan troops there
                        must appear little prospect that they ever will.</p>
                    <p>9. Another step toward rectifying the situation would be to produce a more
                        effective, cohesive regime in Kabul. If nothing else, this would alleviate
                        somewhat the drain on Afghan military strength in the countryside caused by
                        the need to keep a large “Praetorean Guard” in Kabul. This suggests that
                        ultimately <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> will have to go. His
                        replacement, however, is unlikely to be chosen on the basis of his
                        acceptability to the insurgents. He would still be “Russian-installed.” What
                        the Soviets are likely to seek is someone who can pull together the Marxist
                        factions and various groups among the political and military leadership.
                        This would enable the Afghan Marxists and their Soviet allies to concentrate
                        on the insurgency.</p>
                    <p>10. For undertaking these objectives, the immediate need is efficient
                        military forces. By their actions, the Soviets have indicated they are
                        willing to take the large political step of putting their own combat units
                        into a foreign country. Why should we shrink from estimating that they would
                        be willing, once having taken this step, to use their troops in a way and in
                        an amount that could benefit their long range position?</p>

                            that he would depart for Moscow later that day and expected to return to
                            Washington 10 days later. (Telegram 313797 to Moscow, December 6;

                            dominated by concerns over the deployment of Pershing II missiles by
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and SS–20 missiles by the

                    <p>What follows is our best effort to delineate the picture from Moscow’s
                        standpoint.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Outlook</p>
                    <p>The “holding pattern” Moscow had expected to follow Vienna pending <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> ratification has been eroded by a series
                        of bilateral controversies for which the Soviet leadership does not consider
                        itself primarily responsible. The sheer number of these controversies has
                            <pb n="241" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_241"/>had a multiplier effect, each
                        magnifying the significance of the other, and causing both sides to react
                        with greater stridency and rigidity than might otherwise be the case.
                        Heightened tension has affected each side’s media treatment of the other.
                        The Soviets probably see themselves as victims of officially-inspired US
                        press accusations—just as we see ourselves as the injured party in an
                        escalating public dialogue.</p>
                    <p>Faced with these trends, the Soviets are concerned that US-Soviet relations
                        are moving inexorably toward a continuing downslide, in which the whole
                        range of our cooperative activities, including arms control, would come into
                        question. We believe the Soviets would see such a development as contrary to
                        their interests, and that they would hope to avoid it. Developments since
                        Vienna have given them cause to doubt this will be possible, however, and
                        there is a good chance that the review now under way is designed to develop
                        concrete policy options for dealing with a bilateral relationship they may
                        conclude will continue to deteriorate. This would be reflected in their
                        approach to the following specific issues.</p>

                        that the escalating Soviet presence in Afghanistan was “a direct response to

                        concluded that “establishment of a Soviet communications network in

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> Government (<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>), because of factional feuding and
                        disillusionment within party ranks of both civilian and military personnel,
                        rests on an even smaller and shakier basis than its predecessor, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime. Furthermore, despite its total
                        dependence on the Soviet Union’s military assistance for its existence—which
                        should have implied, but has not brought, extensive subservience, rumors
                        persist of Soviet intentions to replace <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, perhaps with leaders of the rival Marxist group, the
                        Parchamists, in order to get a more pliant and effective regime.</p>
                    <p>The country-wide insurgency has confronted the government with a steadily
                        increasing threat throughout this year. Although split geographically,
                        factionalized, and thus unable to mount a major coordinated offensive
                        against a large city, the cumulative effect of the pressures of the many
                        insurgent groupings has caused a steady deterioration of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s military strength and of its capability
                        to exert its authority.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have clearly hoped that an incremental build-up of military
                        advisory personnel and materiel could turn the tide in favor of the
                        government. But they have been unable to compensate for the major military
                        problem, an increasingly acute manpower shortage. Because of casualties,
                        large-scale defections, desertions, and recruitment problems, the army is,
                        by some estimates, down to a force of 50,000 from a norm of 90–100,000.</p>
                    <p>It has seemed almost inevitable that, because of the critical military
                        manpower shortage, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would
                        eventually be faced with the choice of bringing in its own troops or of
                        retiring from the scene. The present build-up of a Soviet combat force in
                        Afghanistan may indicate that the Soviets have concluded that that point has
                        now been reached. The very serious situation in northeastern Badakhshan,
                        where rebels <pb n="245" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_245"/>threaten to gain
                        control over a province on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                        border, may contribute to the making of such a decision at this particular
                        moment. However, given the tens of thousands of Soviet troops who would be
                        necessary to bring about broad pacification of the country as a whole, the
                        present Soviet build-up seems likely to be an attempt to insure the security
                        of the capital region and perhaps to improve the safety of land transport
                        from the Soviet border to Kabul.</p>
                    <p>There is also, however, the possibility that the newly introduced troops have
                        a limited function for a limited time span. If the Soviets were to attempt
                        to oust <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and install a Parchamist
                        government, they would have to contend with resistance from the present
                        military leadership and the possibility that a Soviet-backed coup attempt
                        could back-fire and become also directed against Soviet military advisory
                        personnel. Thus preparations for such a move could consist of bringing in
                        sufficient military force to guarantee its successful execution.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Internal Political Situation</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government is politically
                        very insecure. Not only is it opposed by the population at large, which is
                        conservative and fundamentally Islamic, but its enemies include former
                        leftist collaborators, the Parchamists, and most recently the supporters of
                        former President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has arrested and/or removed from
                        key positions many <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> loyalists
                        but, according to clandestine reports, many remain in the army in important
                        positions. If given another secular and leftist choice, this group might
                        well move against <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The top Parchamist leadership, headed by <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> has been in exile (reportedly in Eastern Europe) since
                        the fall of 1978. Recently several thousand Parchamists were, reportedly,
                        arrested throughout Afghanistan and large numbers were executed. This
                        followed rumors that the Soviets were planning to remove <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and replace him with Parchamists.
                        Earlier there were reports that <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> had been in touch with the Parchamists and was
                        planning, with Soviet support, to bring them back into the government,
                        ousting <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> in the process. Rumors
                        that the Soviets would like to replace the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leadership first surfaced in June 1979 and still
                        persist.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are known to believe that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s ruthless and hasty implementation of Marxist
                        “reforms” in Afghanistan was a major mistake, provoking the country-wide
                        insurgency. Most of these reform programs have been halted by the expediency
                        of declaring them “completed.” Since the inauguration of the new <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government, the emphasis has been on
                        “legality, security and justice” and the drafting of a constitution. In this
                        connection, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has tried to shift
                        the blame to <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> for the large
                        numbers of political arrests and executions in <pb n="246" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_246"/>the preceding months. However, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is widely regarded to have been the
                        strong man in the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> regime and
                        the one responsible for its ruthless policies.</p>

                        Contain It</p>
                    <p>While the insurgency remains uncoordinated and locally led, the number of
                        active rebels has multiplied throughout the year. The rebels’ military
                        capabilities have steadily increased owing to captured equipment and the
                        participation of officers and recruits defecting from the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces. Insurgents now control most of the
                        countryside throughout Afghanistan. They have made travel on the major roads
                        extremely hazardous even in heavily armed convoys and have successfully
                        isolated military outposts.</p>
                    <p>In October, the government was able by assembling massive armored force and
                        air support under Soviet control and direction to mount a successful
                        campaign against the rebels in Paktia province, on the border with Pakistan.
                        However, the actual and psychological effects of this victory appear to have
                        been negated by the subsequent reappearance of the insurgents as the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> was forced to withdraw its armor for
                        redeployment.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> had apparently been counting on a
                        winter lull to reorganize its forces and train new recruits. However, the
                        lull has failed to materialize as the insurgents continue to press and
                        government forces have suffered a number of recent set backs, particularly
                        in areas surrounding Kabul and in northeastern Badakhshan province.</p>
                    <p>There are reports that the rebels intend to step up terrorist activities in
                        urban centers during the winter. The situation in Qandahar indicates this is
                        already in progress in Afghanistan’s second largest city. Reportedly, the
                        government is preparing for an expected rebel attack on the city. There were
                        reports in October that Soviet military personnel had taken over the control
                        of both military and civilian government of Qandahar.</p>
                    <p>The most serious problem affecting the government’s military capability to
                        contain the insurgency appears to be the manpower shortage and the
                        disaffection among both recruits and officers. Throughout the year, there
                        have been constant reports of defections, occasionally involving complete
                        military units. Troop disloyalty is reportedly rampant in the Badakhshan
                        area.</p>
                    <p>The extent of the influence of exile insurgent organizations based in
                        Pakistan is unclear. They undoubtedly have played a supportive role in the
                        provinces bordering on Pakistan, while western and centrally located
                        insurgents may be receiving assistance from groups in Iran. The
                        Pakistan-based groups have been plagued by rivalries and have been unable to
                        unite in a common effort. One important role these <pb n="247" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_247"/>groups can play is acquiring funds and armaments from
                        outside sources. A major Soviet intervention might bring in more funds, thus
                        increasing the importance of the exiles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reaction to the Soviet Role</p>
                    <p>The Soviet presence and role in keeping the present government afloat have
                        become one of the major provocations of the insurgency and a unifying factor
                        for all rebel groups. While insurgents may be fighting, in large part, for
                        local goals, they are united by a desire to get rid of both the “godless”
                        communist regime and the Russians.</p>
                    <p>As the Soviet role has increased throughout the civilian and military
                        establishment, it has provoked a nationalist reaction, even from supporters
                        of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. Recently, an Afghan pilot, probably
                        flying a mission against Badakhshan insurgents, “accidentally” dropped his
                        bombs on the Soviet side of the border, causing several casualties. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] this incident was
                        a great tonic to the otherwise abysmal morale in the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>’s Ministry of Defense.<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">The report was not found.</note></p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> has recently stated publicly that
                        his government is dependent on Soviet support.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3"><persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s statement was
                            reported in telegram 8117 from Kabul, November 21. The telegram quoted
                            two portions of an interview <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                            gave to the Soviet news agency <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>:
                            “We are convinced that if there were no vast economic and military aid
                            from the Soviet Union, we could not resist the aggression and
                            conspiracies of imperialism, its leftist looking allies and
                            international reaction, and could not move our country towards the
                            construction of a socialist society.” <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> further asserted “there is no limit” to Soviet
                            support of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>, and the Soviet
                            assistance level “completely depends on our capacity to absorb and

                            Central Foreign Policy File, D790546–0399 and D790536–0665)</note>
                        However, there has been no indication of an attempt by <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to prepare the public for a
                        large-scale introduction of troops.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets were to intervene to replace <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> or to fight directly against the rebels, they would be
                        opening a new level of anti-Soviet feelings and actions. That would greatly
                        complicate achieving Soviet goals. Achieving these goals under such
                        circumstances would require a major Soviet effort.</p>

                    <p>2. Summary: The recent arrival of three battalions of Soviet combat troops at
                        Bagram Air Force Base has raised many questions here, especially since the
                        insurgency does not appear to have dramatically worsened to the point that
                        it threatens the regime of President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName>. To the much asked question of, “Why did the Soviets
                        send the troops in now?”, I can suggest a few answers: Moscow and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> hope to “preempt” the growth of any
                        direct threat to the regime by injecting an immediate “stiffener” of Soviet
                        troops, particularly should any <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> corps
                        or division disintegrate; the troops are here to protect the safety of
                        Soviet citizens should the security of Kabul collapse; the troops can play a
                        key role in domestic politics should further splits in the leadership occur;
                        and, the troops are merely the vanguard of a larger intervention which will
                        eventually lead to a direct combat role by Soviet forces, a thesis I
                        consider unlikely based on evidence available so far. Motivations behind
                        this move by Kabul and Moscow could well be a combination of these and
                        others, but whatever the case, Afghan claims to “independence” have been
                        further eroded by this development. Moreover, the presence of Soviet troops
                        will undoubtedly heighten domestic opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime and his Soviet mentors, and in
                        the long-run further destabilize the region. My <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> colleagues here generally accept our assurances that the
                        Soviets have installed combat troops at Bagram Air Base, but they are as
                        puzzled as we, if not more so, as to why the Soviets have taken this step
                        now. End of summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Why did Soviet troops arrive now? Eight months ago (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> A), we concluded here that an Afghan
                        SOS to Moscow for direct military help would probably be sent only in face
                        of a seriously deteriorating security situation. We believed at that time
                        that lack of control of most <pb n="251" facs="0296" xml:id="pg_251"/>of the
                        countryside would probably not prompt a <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        cry for Soviet help, because political power here resides in Kabul and the
                        major cities, and because insurgent control of the rural areas would not
                        necessarily constitute a direct threat to the survival of the regime.
                        Moreover, we concluded that for domestic and foreign political reasons, that
                        neither Moscow nor Kabul would want to face the “Soviet troops” decision
                        until other, less dramatic, means to counter the insurgents had been
                        exhausted. Finally, should Soviet troops arrive, we believed they would be
                        used to establish the security of Kabul and the major cities, and would
                        probably not be deployed into the countryside where they could become bogged
                        down in endless fighting over extremely rough terrain.</p>
                    <p>4. The arrival now of several battalions of Soviet airborne and motorized
                        rifle troops raises a number of questions, especially since the domestic
                        situation here does not quite fit the scenario we envisaged earlier this
                        year. Despite the many headaches and political upheavals of the past few
                        months, there have been no urban uprisings or garrison mutinies in any of
                        the major cities similar to those which occurred in Herat in March or Kabul
                        in August and October. Kabul, by far the key to political control of the
                        country, has remained generally untouched by the fighting in the
                        countryside, although there has recently been a dramatic upsurge in urban
                        terrorism aimed at Khalqi officials and Soviet citizens. The key military
                        units in and around Kabul appear to remain loyal to the regime. Moscow would
                        appear, therefore, to have responded to an Afghan appeal for direct military
                        help in a situation which seems not to include an imminent threat to the
                        revolution or even to the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime
                        in Kabul, and I can arrive at only a few reasons for this development.</p>
                    <p>5. Kabul and Moscow hope to “preempt” the development of any serious threat
                        to the regime. In my opinion, the regime’s overall security situation has
                        gradually deteriorated over the past few weeks, caused primarily by a
                        growing military manpower shortage (e.g., the draft age has been lowered
                        from 22 to 20 years), an increase in urban terrorism in Kandahar and Kabul,
                        indications that morale in the military officer corps may be eroding, and
                        persistent reports that alienations within the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> resulting from the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> schism
                        may be worsening. In this situation of gradual, rather than sudden,
                        deterioration, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leadership and
                        Moscow may have decided that an infusion of Soviet combat troops now may
                        provide the necessary “stiffener” for the Afghan military, in order to avoid
                        any abrupt collapse or to protect the key northern approaches to Kabul
                        should <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> units fighting in Samangan and
                        Badakhshan Provinces disintegrate. In this regard, they may have believed
                        that a shot in the arm at this point would be sufficient to bolster the
                        regime until winter weather dampens activities on both sides, something
                        which has not yet taken place.</p>
                    <p><pb n="252" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_252"/>6. Security for Soviet citizens
                        primary but probably not only concern. Security for the hundreds of Soviet
                        citizens—especially in Kabul where they have been targeted for
                        elimination—was most probably a major consideration in the decision to send
                        troops, although I suspect the move has several goals. This particular
                        thesis, however, would be buttressed should the Soviet troops eventually be
                        sent to Kabul to protect the Soviet housing area and Embassy. So far, we
                        have not detected any of the just arrived Soviet combat units in the
                        capital, although Bagram Air Base is only about 40 miles away, and the
                        Soviet decision-makers may elect to leave the troops there, rather than
                        raising their visibility dramatically.</p>
                    <p>7. The troops may eventually play a role in domestic Afghan politics. I
                        assume that the Soviets are very aware that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is widely perceived as the cause of much of this
                        country’s woes, and it is conceivable they may have concluded that his
                        departure may be necessary to save the revolution. I don’t think so. Most of
                        us here are agreed that Moscow’s fundamental commitment is to the revolution
                        (and party) and not to specific individuals. Whether or not Moscow may have
                        a hand in any anti-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> move, there
                        are probably many individuals or small groups gunning for him, and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>-Soviet tensions flowing from the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> affair are widely
                        believed to be serious. By stationing Soviet troops near the capital, Moscow
                        may want to be ready to intervene to back a specific contending faction in
                        the event of intraparty civil war—to preserve the special position of the
                        Soviet Union in the country. I should point out too that these troops
                        represent an impressive argument should the Soviets decide to try and
                        “convince” <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> to leave the scene
                        “voluntarily” for the sake of the revolution’s survival, and in favor of a
                        less “tainted” leftist leader—perhaps a currently unknown military man. At
                        this point, however, I cannot identify any Khalqi leader who could come
                        close to filling <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s shoes, and
                        the exiled Parchamists appear not to hold out much promise as alternate
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>8. Direct Soviet combat role strikes me as unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.
                        I doubt that the Soviet troops here will actually take the field against the
                        insurgents, unless some key <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> military
                        corps or division collapses and Kabul is threatened. At most they might man
                        a roadblock to safeguard one of the approaches to the capital—until loyal
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> relief forces arrived.</p>
                    <p>9. Winter is approaching fast, the countryside is extremely rugged, and, were
                        Soviet units to get spread thin, and engage in search and destroy missions,
                        Soviet combat casualties could well become significant, especially since the
                        guerrilla warfare being waged by the insurgents is not necessarily
                        vulnerable to sophisticated armies. Nonetheless, General <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName>, Commander of Soviet Ground
                        Forces, may have <pb n="253" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_253"/>concluded during
                        his two-month stay in Kabul from mid-August to mid-October, 1979, that a
                        military solution to this domestic conflict is feasible, and that a certain
                        number of Soviet troops can turn the trick. <persName corresp="#p_PIG_1">Pavlovskiy</persName> may also have concluded, of course, that a
                        limited number of troops in non-combat roles would be enough to buck-up the
                        Afghans in their own efforts.</p>
                    <p>10. Afghan independence eroded even further. As I pointed out two months ago
                        in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> B, growing Soviet influence
                        here, and increasing <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> adherence to
                        Moscow’s politics on the world stage, cast doubt on Kabul’s protestations
                        that it is master in its own house. The infusion of Soviet troops adds
                        considerably to this doubt, especially if they actually deploy in the field
                        and begin killing Afghans. Even a more passive Soviet role, however, will
                        undoubtedly heighten opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime among the Afghan masses who generally hate
                        Russians and Communists. In this regard, if I can point to one thing which
                        might unify the heretofore disjointed opposition, it is the arrival of
                        regular Soviet troops. The long-term implications of direct Soviet military
                        involvement here could thus be far-reaching, despite the presumed legality
                        of the move under the 1978 Soviet-Afghan bilateral treaty.</p>
                    <p>11. Local reaction remains muted. In spite of the international media
                        attention being devoted to this development, there has not yet been any
                        observed reaction among Kabul’s residents, excluding the urban terrorism
                        campaign which is probably unrelated. My <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadorial colleagues generally accept our word that
                        the Soviet military presence has risen at Bagram, and are even more puzzled
                        than we as to why it should occur now.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>It is hard to exaggerate the importance of what the Soviets are now poised to
                        do in Afghanistan. Essentially, they seem to have made a decision to risk
                        whatever is necessary, including major involvement in armed combat, to
                        maintain a Communist government in Kabul. Given their military capabilities,
                        the terrain and the division of the insurgents, they will almost certainly
                        have considerable initial success if they pull out all stops (as we learned
                        in Viet Nam, the helicopter gunship can be a very successful “pacification”
                        tool). The real military question boils down to the staying power of the
                        insurgents and the attitude of the Pakistanis, and we can play a key role on
                        both counts.</p>
                    <p>This was not an easy decision for the Kremlin, which realizes that its own
                        “counter-insurgency” effort will inevitably be compared to what we did in
                        Viet Nam. As such, they will be doubly determined to succeed where we
                        failed. They are also far more experienced in this area than we are, and
                        their ruthlessness will not hurt them either. Equally important is the fact
                        that this is the first time since World War II that the Soviets are using
                        their own forces in a combat situation outside the borders of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe. This therefore seems
                        to complete a chain of events which began in Angola in 1975, was continued
                        in Ethiopia (where a Soviet General assumed command of the operation), and
                        now culminates in Afghanistan. If the Soviets manage a successful
                        counter-insurgency effort, it will lead almost inevitably to further
                        “adventurism” in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">What is to be done?</p>
                    <p>Given the current situation, we are not in a position to ignore what is
                        happening in Afghanistan. It is necessary for us to develop both a <pb n="255" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_255"/>public stance and a series of
                        concrete actions in order to deal with this situation. I recommend that we
                        consider taking at least some of the following specific steps:</p>
                    <p>1. Use all the means at our disposal to publicize what the Soviets are doing
                        in Afghanistan. Major themes in this campaign should be as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. This is the first use by the Soviets of their armed forces in a combat
                        situation outside the Soviet bloc since the Second World War.</p>
                    <p>b. Afghanistan has been a buffer state—in fact, the classic buffer state—for
                        the past 150 years. The Soviets have no legitimate national interest in
                        taking such action.</p>
                    <p>c. The United States has never made a commitment to the military defense of
                        Afghanistan, which has been outside our defense perimeter for the past 25
                        years.</p>
                    <p>d. Nevertheless, we are extremely concerned at this unjustifiable Soviet
                        action, especially in that it might become an unwelcome precedent in other
                        areas. What are the limits to the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine?<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">In a speech in

                            and therefore “must engage the attention of all the socialist states,”
                            including the use of military force.</note></p>
                    <p>e. We are also extremely concerned at the human toll which this
                        Soviet-supported combat is taking. There are 300,000 refugees now in
                        Pakistan, and we would not be surprised to see that number rise to half a
                        million in the near future.</p>
                    <p>f. Thus, as in Cambodia and in so many other countries since World War II,
                        the Soviets are creating another enormous refugee problem, this time in
                        South Asia and among an overwhelmingly Muslim population.</p>
                    <p>g. The United States is prepared to do its utmost to assist the Afghan
                        refugees with humanitarian aid.</p>
                    <p>h. The Soviet Union is atheistic by doctrine and has published enormous
                        amounts of anti-religious and anti-Muslim literature. (The exhibition at the
                        Museum of Religion and Atheism in Leningrad, for example, would strike any
                        Muslim as the epitome of sacrilege.) The US, on the other hand, firmly
                        believes in religious freedom, and enshrines it in our Constitution. Three
                        million Muslims practice their religion freely in the US. In Soviet
                        Azerbaijan, on the other hand, there are only 24 officially recognized
                        Mosques now operating, whereas before the revolution of 1917 there were
                        several thousand in operation.</p>
                    <p><pb n="256" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_256"/>i. In sum, the US deplores the
                        Soviet action in Afghanistan, regards it as reckless adventurism, feels that
                        superpowers should not behave in this manner, is deeply concerned at the
                        human suffering among the Afghan population, and will do everything in its
                        power to deal with this problem in a constructive, statesmanlike manner. It
                        calls on all nations, and particularly nations with significant Muslim
                        populations, to appeal to the Soviet Union to allow the Afghan people to
                        settle its own problems in line with the principle of no interference in the
                        internal affairs of other nations. Hands off Afghanistan!</p>
                    <p>2. Dispatch a mission to Pakistan to investigate conditions in the Afghan
                        refugee camps there.</p>
                    <p>a. In line with the mission’s (undoubted) shock at the abysmal conditions
                        within the refugee camp, issue a statement publicizing those conditions.</p>
                    <p>b. Turn loose our refugee apparatus on the problem and call for assistance
                        both from the American public and from other countries and international
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>c. Place the blame for this human catastrophe on the Soviets, where it
                        belongs.</p>
                    <p>3. Explore, directly or indirectly, with the Saudis, the Libyans, the
                        Chinese, and other potential sympathizers with the Afghan Muslim cause, the
                        possibility of stepping up covert assistance to the insurgents and the use
                        of bases and refugee camps inside Pakistan to support the insurgency.</p>
                    <p>4. Call an <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> to examine our policy toward
                        both Pakistan and Afghanistan. One aim of such an <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> should be to find the correct mix of incentives and
                        guarantees that we would need to stiffen the spine of the Pakistanis to
                        resist Moscow’s and Kabul’s pressure to help destroy the insurgency. This is
                        an immediate goal and an important one, which might become more important to
                        the President as the election period wears on. (As a Government, we must be
                        in a position to defend ourselves against charges that we are sitting back
                        and allowing the Soviets to add another country to the Communist camp
                        without doing anything about it, as well as charges from the other direction
                        that we are not doing enough to relieve the human misery caused by Soviet
                        action in Afghanistan.)</p>
                    <p>In sum, major Soviet combat involvement in a long-term insurgency in
                        Afghanistan is something which the US Government must respond to in a
                        concrete way and with both a public position and a private action plan. We
                        should be ready to move on this as soon as possible, but first we need
                        clear-cut overall guidance.</p>

                            a memorandum from Claytor to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, December 21. Claytor questioned whether the

                            sufficient in light of increased Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
                            Citing a need to “keep the Afghan insurgency going,” Claytor argued that
                            the United States should “frustrate the Soviets” and demonstrate “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> resolve to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and
                            others in the area.” Claytor called for an <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting because “the situation calls for more than just

                        also accuses the US and China of training Afghan insurgents at bases in
                        Pakistan. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>The situation in the northeastern province of Badakshan remains critical,
                        with only the capital under firm government control. [<hi rend="italic">1

                    <p>The rebels evidently are also threatening provincial capitals in western and
                        central Afghanistan. Fighting has been moving closer to the capital of
                        Badghist Province, and most of Ghowr and Oruzgan provinces reportedly are
                        controlled by the insurgents. A shortage of transport helicopters has
                        evidently hampered reinforcement of critical areas. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>The government evidently is trying to stem desertions and to increase the

                        taken against them. The Army has also transferred some troops out of their
                        home districts to keep them from returning to their villages. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>Earlier this month, the government reportedly lowered the draft age from 22
                        to 20 and stopped issuing passports to draft-aged males. Kabul has also
                        begun to offer good salaries to discharged servicemen to protect their own
                        villages. This program apparently is designed to free regular Army units for
                        combat elsewhere and to discourage former soldiers from joining the rebels.

                    <p>8592. <gloss target="#t_Subj_1">Subj</gloss>: (<gloss target="#t_LOU_1">LOU</gloss>) Massive Soviet Air Operations Into Kabul Continue.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: Massive Soviet air operations into Kabul began Christmas morning
                        and have not stopped yet. AN–22s, heavy jets, and AS–<pb n="261" facs="0306" xml:id="pg_261"/>12s have been observed in large numbers, and the total
                        flights may now exceed one hundred fifty to two hundred. (Most of these
                        aircraft have had Soviet Air Force markings.) No information is available as
                        yet regarding what was on those planes, but we have not yet seen any Soviet
                        troops on the streets of Kabul, nor have we observed any significant
                        increase in the Afghan military’s alert status in the capital. End of
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. The first of three phases of intensive operations began at about 0400
                        Christmas morning and continued until just before 0700. These flights are
                        probably all AN–22s, since they were the only aircraft seen after dawn broke
                        at about 0600. Numbers of aircraft involved is very difficult to pin down,
                        but at one point an Embassy officer (a former Air Force intelligence
                        officer) could see five AN–22s stacked over the city, despite his limited
                        field of view caused by nearby buildings and trees. Given this density of
                        traffic, we would estimate that a minimum of twenty AN–22s arrived and/or
                        departed Kabul during this first phase, although the number could have been
                        much higher. Some of these aircraft departed the city beginning at about
                        1100, while at least four were observed still on the ground at 1500.</p>
                    <p>4. These operations were just the preliminary, however, as more action
                        appeared to get underway at about 1800 Christmas evening. Heavy jet aircraft
                        were heard arriving in fairly quick succession, but by that hour darkness
                        had fallen and, combined with a low ceiling, it was impossible to determine
                        the exact type of plane. These were definitely heavy jets, however, possibly
                        IL–76 or something somewhat smaller. Again, the numbers of aircraft involved
                        is impossible for us to determine with any certainty but we estimate that
                        about twenty jet transports may have been operating during this second
                        phase.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, at about 2200 Christmas evening, operations switched to
                        turbo-prop aircraft (most probably AN–12s, but possibly AN–22s as well).
                        These seemingly unending flights continued throughout the night and have not
                        stopped as yet. One officer counted more than one hundred and thirty flights
                        between 2200 and about 0600 this morning. Since daybreak, we have seen
                        AN–12s and AN–22s in the skies over Kabul.</p>
                    <p>6. We have no firm information as yet regarding what was on these aircraft,
                        although some credible reports contend that heavy equipment and ammunition
                        was on yesterday morning’s AN–22 contingent. We have not seen anything
                        resembling mass movements of any Soviet troops who may have been on these
                        planes, but there are routes leaving the airport which the regime could use
                        which would not be visible to innocent observers. It strikes us that this
                        massive sky train could easily have brought in thousands of personnel, and
                        we will report immediately if any Soviet troops are seen in or around the
                        capital.</p>
                    <p><pb n="262" facs="0307" xml:id="pg_262"/>7. After the above was written, a
                        State officer arriving from New Delhi this morning saw about 200 Soviet Army
                        troops around some of the planes at Kabul Airport. He also saw a group of
                        APCs deployed at the east end of the runway. This leads us to believe that
                        the Soviet troops are probably being deployed directly from the aircraft to
                        waiting transportation, thereby bypassing the main highway into Kabul.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> briefed the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> on Soviet military actions in Afghanistan over the past two
                        days. As many as 215 transports, including AN–22s, AN–12s, and IL–76s,
                        arrived in Afghanistan from the Soviet Union <pb n="263" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_263"/>during December 25th. Kabul airport appears to be a
                        major reception point. Activity at Bagram airport is not known. This size
                        airlift, it is speculated, could raise the Soviet combat force level in
                        Afghanistan to somewhere between two-thirds and one and one-half divisions.
                        No ground forces at Termez or Kushka have yet crossed the border into
                        Afghanistan. Thus we have an unusually large air movement but no ground
                        re-enforcement. There is command and control intelligence indicating direct
                        politburo supervision of parts of this operation. (S)</p>
                    <p>The greatest risk that we face is a quick, effective Soviet operation to
                        pacify Afghanistan. This would be extremely costly to our image in the
                        region and to your position here at home.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">These

                    <p>1. We will permit information of the newest Soviet actions to reach the media
                        on its own and maintain our current public posture.</p>
                    <p>2. The new developments will be briefed promptly to concerned countries in
                        the region as well as other interested parties.</p>
                    <p>3. State will brief the Congressional leadership today in connection with
                        planned briefings on Iran.</p>
                    <p>4. You should not become personally involved in a further demarche to the
                        Soviets at this time. We will have <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Tom

                        recent troop movements; the Soviets have probably passed the point of no
                        return. (S)</p>

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. You should seek appointment with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> or highest available level as soon as possible on
                        question of Soviet troop deployments into Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). Talking points are as follows.</p>
                    <p>3. —The United States is fully aware that the Soviet Union has begun
                        introducing large numbers of Soviet military forces into Afghanistan in
                        recent days, with large numbers of flights landing at Kabul Airport.</p>
                    <p>—The introduction of large numbers of Soviet combat-equipped units into
                        Afghanistan on December 25–26 can only be considered as direct, deliberate
                        intervention in the internal affairs of that country, with obvious
                        consequences for the peace and stability of the region as a whole.</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side asks the Soviet Government for
                        immediate clarification of its actions and intentions with regard to the
                        situation in Afghanistan. It is obvious that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest is real, legitimate, and urgent, involving not
                        only our interest in the independence of Afghanistan, as a sovereign
                        country, but posing clear implications for the international community as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>4. You should add orally that the United States has the firm expectation that
                        the introduction of Soviet forces into Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan
                        will in no way lead to any situation which places the safety of American
                        personnel in Afghanistan in jeopardy.</p>

                                1979–September 1980</ref>.</note> This memorandum is meant merely to
                        provide some stimulus to your thinking on this subject.</p>
                    <p>As I mentioned to you a week or so ago, we are now facing <hi rend="italic">a
                            regional crisis</hi>. Both Iran and Afghanistan are in turmoil, and
                        Pakistan is both unstable internally and extremely apprehensive
                            externally.<note n="4" xml:id="d97fn4">The implications of the
                            region-wide crisis were examined more fully in a memorandum prepared in
                            the Central Intelligence Agency, December 26, entitled “The Troubles of
                            Southwest Asia.” Characterizing the entire region as in “turmoil, albeit
                            from a variety of causes,” the memorandum argued that this trend
                            constituted a “net gain” for the Soviet Union. The memorandum further
                            argued that both superpowers were being pushed by forces they could not
                            control: for the United States it was the hostage crisis in Iran; for
                            the Soviet Union it was the insurgency in Afghanistan. (Central
                            Intelligence Agency, Directorate of Intelligence, Office of Support
                            Services, Job 82T00267R: Production Case Files, Box 2, The Troubles in
                            Southwest Asia)</note> If the Soviets succeed in Afghanistan, and if
                        Pakistan acquiesces, the age-long dream of Moscow to have direct access to
                        the Indian Ocean will have been fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Historically, the British provided the barrier to that drive and Afghanistan
                        was their buffer state. We assumed that role in 1945, but the Iranian crisis
                        has led to the collapse of the balance of power in Southwest Asia, and it
                        could produce Soviet presence right down on the edge of the Arabian and Oman
                        Gulfs.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan poses for us an extremely
                        grave challenge, both internationally and domestically. While it could
                        become a Soviet Vietnam, the initial effects of the inter<pb n="266" facs="0311" xml:id="pg_266"/>vention are likely to be adverse for us for
                        the following domestic and international reasons:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Domestic</p>
                    <p>A. The Soviet intervention is likely to stimulate calls for more immediate
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military action in Iran. Soviet
                        “decisiveness” will be contrasted with our restraint, which will no longer
                        be labeled as prudent but increasingly as timid;</p>
                    <p>B. At the same time, regional instability may make a resolution of the
                        Iranian problem more difficult for us, and it could bring us into a head to
                        head confrontation with the Soviets;</p>
                    <p>C. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is likely to be damaged, perhaps
                        irreparably, because Soviet military aggressiveness will have been so
                        naked;</p>
                    <p>D. More generally, our handling of Soviet affairs will be attacked by both
                        the Right and the Left.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">International</p>
                    <p>A. Pakistan, unless we somehow manage to project both confidence and power
                        into the region, is likely to be intimidated, and it could eventually even
                        acquiesce to some form of external Soviet domination.</p>
                    <p>B. With Iran destabilized, there will be no firm bulwark in Southwest Asia
                        against the Soviet drive to the Indian Ocean;</p>
                    <p>C. The Chinese will certainly note that Soviet assertiveness in Afghanistan
                        and in Cambodia is not effectively restrained by the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Compensating Factors</p>
                    <p>There will be, to be sure, some compensating factors:</p>
                    <p>A. World public opinion may be outraged at the Soviet intervention.
                        Certainly, Moslem countries will be concerned, and we might be in a position
                        to exploit this.</p>
                    <p>B. There are already 300,000 refugees from Afghanistan in Pakistan and we
                        will be in a position to indict the Soviets for causing massive human
                        suffering. That figure will certainly grow, and Soviet-sponsored actions in
                        Cambodia have already taken their toll as well.</p>
                    <p>C. There will be greater awareness among our allies for the need to do more
                        for their own defense.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Soviet Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>However, we should not be too sanguine about Afghanistan becoming a Soviet
                        Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>A. The guerrillas are badly organized and poorly led;</p>
                    <p>B. They have no sanctuary, no organized army, and no central government—all
                        of which North Vietnam had;</p>
                    <p><pb n="267" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_267"/>C. They have limited foreign
                        support, in contrast to the enormous amount of arms that flowed to the
                        Vietnamese from both the Soviet Union and China;</p>
                    <p>D. The Soviets are likely to act decisively, unlike the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, which pursued in Vietnam a policy of
                        “inoculating” the enemy.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence, the Soviets might be able to assert themselves effectively,
                        and in world politics nothing succeeds like success, whatever the moral
                        aspects.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">What is to be Done?</p>
                    <p>What follows are some preliminary thoughts, which need to be discussed more
                        fully:</p>
                    <p>A. It is essential that Afghanistani resistance continues. This means more
                        money as well as arms shipments to the rebels, and some technical
                        advice;</p>
                    <p>B. To make the above possible we must both reassure Pakistan and encourage it
                        to help the rebels. This will require a review of our policy toward
                        Pakistan, more guarantees to it, more arms aid, and, alas, a decision that
                        our security policy toward Pakistan cannot be dictated by our
                        nonproliferation policy;</p>
                    <p>C. We should encourage the Chinese to help the rebels also;</p>
                    <p>D. We should concert with Islamic countries both in a propaganda campaign and
                        in a covert action campaign to help the rebels;</p>
                    <p>E. We should inform the Soviets that their actions are placing <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in jeopardy and that will also influence
                        the substance of the <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> visit to

                        that our relations will suffer, I fear the Soviets will not take our
                        “expressions of concern” very seriously, with the effect that our relations

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: The unprecedented Christmas airlift of Soviet combat units into
                        Kabul underscores the qualitative change in political developments here. The
                        ramifications of the Soviet move are chilling, both as regards the future of
                        Afghanistan itself and the region as a whole. Internally, we may soon see
                        Soviet divisions operating side by side with loyal <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> troops to suppress the insurgency—despite the likelihood of
                        widespread genocide. Externally, the success of the Soviets will have an
                        unsettling effect on the region, more likely to lead to a general posture of
                        accommodation than of defiance.</p>
                    <p>3. On the local scene, the airlift is likely to have as much political as
                        strictly military objectives. Moscow now has its own forces close to the
                        political heart of the country, thereby perhaps insuring that it will have a
                        loud voice should further internal tensions tear the Khalqis’ political
                        fabric.</p>
                    <p>4. Any semblance of Afghan political independence has virtually been
                        eliminated by this massive airlift, and it could well be years, if ever,
                        before a Communist revolutionary regime is sufficiently secure that Soviet
                        troops can be withdrawn. Reaction of those Afghans willing to express their
                        views has been one of despair, as they believe Soviet troops will now
                        guarantee the survival of the hated <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime. Even if inaccurate in some respects, one Afghan
                        merchant sadly claimed that “Afghanistan has now become a second
                        Czechoslovakia.” End of summary.</p>
                    <p>5. Massive airlift underscores the qualitative change in events that has
                        taken place here. The injection of Soviet combat forces into Afghanistan to
                        prop up a regime that may not have survived without such help, and the
                        unabashedly public manner in which these forces were deployed, underscore
                        the depth of the qualitative change which has <pb n="269" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_269"/>occurred. The Afghan Government has yet to mention the
                        event publicly, and Moscow has also remained mute regarding the despatch of
                        perhaps two hundred Soviet Air Force planes and possibly thousands of Soviet
                        combat troops to a neighboring country. Whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will formally invoke the “<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine” to justify its action
                        remains to be seen. If so, it will be difficult to avoid the conclusion that
                        the Khalqi regime in Kabul is considered a full-fledged member of the
                        “socialist community of states.” On the other hand, the two governments may
                        rely on the December 5, 1978, Treaty of Friendship as justification for
                        “cooperation” between two sovereign states. This would strike us as
                        potentially ominous for other countries with similar treaties, since Moscow
                        has decided to send combat forces to a non-Warsaw Pact country at the
                        request of a clearly unpopular Communist regime hanging on to power by its
                        fingernails and dependent principally on the zeal of a small cadre of
                        dedicated party members, and the loyalty of a few key military units in and
                        around the capital.</p>
                    <p>6. This particular phase of Soviet military activity may now be completed,
                        and it is unknown if additional forces will be sent to Kabul or to other
                        Afghan cities or military bases. Our guess is they will. The dimensions of
                        the Christmas airlift to Kabul, however, are apparent to all observers here,
                        and it is now clear even to those who downplayed the importance of the three
                        battalions of Soviet troops at Bagram Air Base that political developments
                        have entered a new phase with the arrival of Soviet units in Afghanistan’s
                        capital. In this context, we would like to reexamine the analysis in our
                            <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> to set forth the added
                        dimensions which we see flowing from recent events.</p>
                    <p>7. The impact of the airlift will in time have repercussions beyond
                        Afghanistan’s borders. In addition to the effect these events will have
                        within this country, there is sure to be a major impact on regional and
                        international relationships well beyond Afghanistan’s borders. In the wake
                        of high-level expressions of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern at
                        the arrival of the three battalions of Soviet troops at Bagram Air Base, the
                        massive and blatant airlift to Kabul strikes us as a distinct and overt
                        disregard of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests on the part of
                        the Kremlin. Despite whatever “legality” the move may have under the 1978
                        bilateral treaty, Moscow has apparently elected to underpin with military
                        force a despotic regime which came to power 20 months ago through a classic
                        military coup d’état, whose human rights record is among the worst in the
                        world, and whose “legitimacy” as the genuine representative of the will of
                        the Afghan people can be seriously questioned, if not completely
                        discarded.</p>
                    <p>8. Afghanistan’s regional neighbors are also likely to take some sobering
                        second looks at the ramifications of Soviet Army forces sitting in Kabul and
                        some probably elsewhere around the country. Pakistan, of course, will
                        probably feel itself most threatened by this development, <pb n="270" facs="0315" xml:id="pg_270"/>and some of our Pakistani colleagues here
                        have already expressed genuine fears that this airlift is merely the initial
                        stage of a larger Soviet “occupation” aimed at dominance in the region.
                        India as well may not welcome a massive Soviet military presence here,
                        despite constant <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> assertions that
                        Indian-Afghan relations rate in importance only behind Afghanistan’s
                        fraternal relations with the Socialist countries. We presume that the chaos
                        in Iran will greatly diffuse whatever concern that government would normally
                        have over this development.</p>
                    <p>9. In sum, not only may the Soviet military airlift—which may by no means be
                        over—have potentially damaging ramifications on our relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and with the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>, but it adds one more seriously
                        destabilizing factor to a region already rife with instability and potential
                        chaos.</p>
                    <p>10. Within Afghanistan, the airlift is likely to have both political and
                        military goals. Several of the points discussed in our <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> remain valid in the wake of the
                        airlift. These newly arrived forces could clearly provide security for the
                        hundreds of Soviet citizens in and around Kabul, although the forces which
                        have been sent to the capital appear excessive to this particular role.
                        Likewise, these units now deployed at the political heart of the country
                        could constitute the “stiffener” for the Afghan Army in its
                        counterinsurgency fight. The Soviet units may, moreover, take on the added
                        responsibility for the security of the capital, in order to free certain of
                        the apparently loyal and more heavily armed Afghan units for active
                        deployment against the insurgents operating near Kabul. The prospect,
                        however, that is most sobering is that in the year ahead Soviet forces (Army
                        and Air Force) will undertake a direct role in the fighting, side by side
                        with loyal <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces.</p>
                    <p>11. At this point, political considerations rather than strictly military
                        concerns may be at the root of the Soviet move. The mid-December gunfight at
                        the “People’s House” in Kabul, which resulted in the probable death of
                        Assadullah <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> (Second Deputy
                        Foreign Minister, a top party official and President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>’s son-in-law) and perhaps
                        Politburo member Abdul Hakim Sahrayee Jauzjani, highlights the instability
                        of the Khalqi leadership. Moscow may, therefore, have decided to move now in
                        order to have its own forces on the scene in the event that the fragile
                        political leadership were to suddenly shatter as a result of an assassin’s
                        bullet, or following another intramural gunfight. Since Soviet advice to the
                        Afghans last summer to form a broader political base was apparently ignored
                        by the Khalqis, the Soviets may feel that locally available “muscle” to back
                        up future “advice” is mandatory to protect Moscow’s interests and investment
                        in this country. An integral element here, of course, is the flexibility the
                        Soviet forces provide to Moscow should the Afghan political leadership split
                        into contending factions, or should some Afghan military contingent <pb n="271" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_271"/>attempt to replace the Khalqis. In
                        the bigger picture, the Soviet move underscores Moscow’s commitment to the
                        revolution, a commitment the Soviets may have wanted to highlight for the
                        benefit of other fraternal parties and regimes.</p>
                    <p>12. Afghan independence now virtually non-existent. As pointed out in our
                            <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, the arrival of a few Soviet
                        battalions at Bagram Air Base cast further doubt on Afghanistan’s ability to
                        pursue any independent course on the international scene. In our view, the
                        airlift virtually eliminates any question on this issue. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> has apparently elected to
                        place the security of his revolution in Moscow’s hands for the sake of
                        retaining his power. Given the current forces at work on Afghanistan’s
                        political scene, it could be years before a Communist regime is sufficiently
                        secure that a Soviet withdrawal would be feasible.</p>
                    <p>13. Local reaction to the airlift—and what may follow—has been mostly
                        despair. Those few Afghans who have been willing to voice their reactions to
                        these events (a risky step these days) have generally despaired at what the
                        airlift portends for their country. Most believe that the arrival of Soviet
                        combat forces means there is now little, if any, chance of unseating the
                        Khalqis, and that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and his
                        followers will now embark on an even more repressive policy of stamping out
                        all perceived opposition. A Kabul flower vendor was not all that wide of the
                        mark when he remarked sadly to an Embassy officer yesterday that
                        “Afghanistan has now become a second Czechoslovakia.”</p>

                        extension of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine
                        to Afghanistan, but it also raises the related question of whether the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime has not now lost its
                        legitimacy. Hence, I recommend a new policy review of Afghanistan/<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> by a group of countries, such as the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> powers, Pakistan, India and
                        China, to try to bring about a Soviet withdrawal; or the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> raising the issue of Soviet intervention
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council, and our urging
                        the termination of <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss> and World Bank aid
                        to the Soviet satellite; and/or our giving massive assistance to the Afghan
                        insurgents. Were either or both of the latter two options adopted, we would
                        have to break our relations with this puppet regime and withdraw all
                        official American personnel from the country. Our <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> monitoring capability would thereby also suffer. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Whether you call it a “qualitative change” or a new ball game, we have now
                        a different political situation in Afghanistan. By <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, we have just reexamined the
                        question of why the Soviets chose to bring in troops at this time. We
                        concluded that the reasons were probably multi-purpose, but at heart were to
                        try to make sure the Khalqi party remained in power and the country within
                        the Soviet orbit.</p>
                    <p>4. The fact that the Soviets, with presumably <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>’s consent and/or invitation, were impelled
                        to introduce combat troops suggests too that both parties had concluded that
                        the Khalqi regime could not otherwise long survive. Counter-insurgency
                        efforts were having mixed results, urban terrorism was increasing,
                        dissatisfaction in the Khalqi party was widespread, and the Soviets were
                        probably painfully conscious that they were expected to meet all the
                        expensive bills for hardware and the ever growing numbers of Soviet
                        advisors. <pb n="273" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_273"/>They must have concluded
                        that an intervention of Soviet forces was necessary to save the regime and
                        for Soviet prestige.</p>
                    <p>5. I suspect that Soviet intervention in Afghanistan is the first occasion
                        since World War II of the Soviets entering a non-Warsaw Pact country to
                        maintain the special Soviet position. In Eastern Europe, when uprisings
                        occurred in Poland and the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>, Soviet
                        troops were already in place, and in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, Soviet
                        troops intervened to reestablish those governments’ “traditional” and proper
                        position within the Soviet sphere. Thus, the introduction of Soviet troops
                        into Afghanistan would appear to represent a blatant power move by Moscow to
                        expand its sphere of influence in the world.</p>
                    <p>6. What should the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> do? Whether or not
                        the <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss>’s planned IG meeting on
                        Afghanistan has already convened,<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">No record of a
                            meeting was found.</note> I think it would be timely for the <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss> to consider the implications of the new
                        developments in Afghanistan, I also believe the time has come for us to take
                        some new policy initiatives. The fact that the Soviets have disregarded our
                        verbal warnings of the recent past suggests that they have been ineffective
                        and shrugged off by the Soviets as being all bark but no bite.</p>
                    <p>7. I would thus like to propose two possible courses of action, the second of
                        which could follow on the first.</p>
                    <p>8. The first course, this would be to try to mobilize the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries, together with India,
                        Pakistan, <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, Saudi Arabia, Japan (and
                        perhaps Iran through a third country), to make a harmonized if not joint
                        démarche to the Soviet Union.<note n="4" xml:id="d99fn4">The idea to send
                            out telegrams to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Allies on policy
                            toward Afghanistan was taken up at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting the next day. See <ref target="#d107fn4">footnote 4, Document 107</ref>.</note> The démarche would consist
                        of a proposal that regional stability required two things: the establishment
                        of a new, broader-based government in Afghanistan, which would include
                        non-Khalqi and oppositionist elements; and the withdrawal of Soviet forces.
                        The Soviets, by their military presence now in Kabul, can now probably
                        influence the shape of any Afghan government; <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> would probably have to go, but the Soviets
                        probably have the power to make him do so. The alternative for the Soviets
                        is prolongation of the expensive civil war, which could drag on for
                        years.</p>
                    <p>9. This idea of a harmonized joint démarche originates with the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Ambassador, Karl Berninger. While I see
                        formidable obstacles to trying to galvanize any kind of harmonized démarche
                        to the Soviets, and little chance of its succeeding, I see little harm in
                        its being attempted and some advantages to our consulting with the mentioned
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>10. The second alternative. This course would see us take a tougher stand. It
                        would be based on the reality that Afghanistan is no longer <pb n="274" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_274"/>truly independent and has become a puppet
                        of the Soviet Union. Since most Afghans despise the regime, and the
                        government has at best tenuous control of urban centers, its legitimacy can
                        now be questioned. The fact that Soviet troops have had to intervene to keep
                        it from collapsing makes too its legitimacy moot. A tough anti-Khalqi stand
                        by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be widely welcomed by
                        Afghans. I thus wonder whether, were the first option to fail, we should not
                        consider labeling the present regime illegitimate and taking certain
                        follow-up measures. I appreciate that such a course would require our
                        cutting diplomatic relations with the Khalqi govt, and the withdrawal of our
                        official presence in the country. This I realize would end our capability to
                        help monitor Soviet <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> compliance.
                        Follow-up actions which we might take might include raising in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council the charge of Soviet
                        intervention and to appeal for Soviet withdrawal. It would also be proper
                        for us to try to terminate World Bank and <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss> aid to this country, which together now comes to $100
                        million per year.</p>
                    <p>11. Last, but by no means least, we should then address the question of
                        whether the time has not come to assist the insurgents on a large scale. I
                        realize the last cannot be done without Pakistani concurrence, and that this
                        would have difficult policy ramifications for the whole unsettled world of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan relations (and the Glenn
                            Amendment).<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5">Under the Glenn Amendment to the
                            Arms Export Control Act (Section 102), the President can apply sanctions
                            against a non-nuclear state that detonates a nuclear device. The status
                            of non-nuclear states is defined by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act,
                            which <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> signed into law
                            March 10, 1978.</note></p>
                    <p>12. I am also not unmindful of other competing considerations, which
                        complicate the Afghanistan situation, such as our attempts to get <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cooperation to free our Tehran hostages,
                        and to achieve <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Two. The <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss> is in a better position than I to weigh
                        these other factors. In looking though at the big picture, what disturbs me
                        is that almost annually the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is
                        succeeding in expanding its power around the globe, and that here in the
                        subcontinent the possible extension of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine is likely in the long run to be
                        detrimental to regional stability and our interests.</p>
                    <p>13. In sum, I think the arrival of Soviet troops calls for new initiatives
                        and new thinking about the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> posture
                        towards this government.</p>

                    <p>8627. Sitrept No. 1. <gloss target="#t_Subj_1">Subj</gloss>: Heavy Fighting
                        Erupts Between Soviet and Afghan Forces in Kabul.</p>
                    <p>1. At approximately 1930 Dec 27 heavy fighting broke out in Kabul involving
                        the units of the Soviet forces brought into this city over the past two
                        days. There has been heavy fighting at Radio Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_RA_1">RA</gloss>) next to the Embassy, and two tanks have
                        been knocked out and are burning behind <gloss target="#t_RA_1">RA</gloss>.
                        The Soviet forces were seen moving quickly to secure <gloss target="#t_RA_1">RA</gloss>, and it appears initially that they caught the Afghan units
                        by surprise. It remains unclear, however, whether all Afghan military units
                        are resisting the Soviet forces. There have been signs that fighting may be
                        taking place in or around some of the military bases on the outskirts of the
                        capital. There has as yet been no air activity of any kind over the city.
                        Afghans have been seen as prisoners of Soviet troops at <gloss target="#t_RA_1">RA</gloss>. Our preliminary assessment is that although
                        it is possible that the Afghan military has split into pro and anti-Soviet
                        elements as a reaction to the recent massive airlift, we may also be looking
                        at a Soviet attempt to overthrow the present Afghan regime by force.</p>
                    <p>2. We are in a phase three alert and all Americans have been advised to
                        remain where they are for the night. No Americans have been reported injured
                        in the fighting. The Mission is manned by a skeleton staff, and we are in
                        communication with the community by radio. The city’s phone system is dead.
                        The Embassy building has been hit by small arms fire, but no significant
                        damage has been caused.</p>
                    <p>3. At about 2215, someone broke in to the heretofore regular Radio
                        Afghanistan programming and announced that “<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is finished, <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was no good, we support all Afghans and Mullahs.” This
                        particular and very brief transmission was not of high quality, but that
                        could indicate that it did in fact emanate from the embattled Radio
                        Afghanistan building next door. The speaker did not identify himself, nor
                        did he apparently extend his wrath to the party or the revolution.</p>
                    <p>4. We have no idea of the present fate of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> nor his supporters. What is clear is that
                        the Soviet units control the Radio <pb n="276" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_276"/>Afghanistan compound, although they may not fully control access to all
                        microphones. Dance music has now returned to the airwaves.</p>
                    <p>5. As of 2230, fighting has died down near the Embassy, but sounds of distant
                        firing in various directions continue. Tracer rounds have been seen in the
                        direction of Kabul Airport, and at about 2200 a [garble] turboprop aircraft
                        was heard over the city. It is not sure that it attempted to land.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern over wide-scale
                        introduction of Soviet military units into Afghanistan and to ask for
                        immediate clarification of Soviet Government’s actionsand intentions.
                        Soviets had obviously anticipated our démarche and Mal’tsev was prepared
                        with a written statement which he said he was instructed to convey to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> personally. The statement
                        acknowledged that “limited” Soviet forces have gone into Afghanistan at
                        Afghan Government request to repel “external” aggression in accordance with
                        Article 51 of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">Article 51 of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter reads: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent
                            right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs
                            against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has
                            taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.
                            Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defense
                            shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in
                            any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council
                            under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems
                            necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and
                            security.” For the text of the Charter, see <hi rend="italic">A Decade

                        said Soviet forces would be withdrawn when the reasons for their being sent
                        no longer exist. The text of the statement follows.</p>
                    <p>3. Begin text:</p>
                    <p>I am authorized to transmit confidentially for the Government of the United
                        States of America and personally for the President the following:</p>
                    <p>As is well-known everywhere in the world, including to the Government of the
                        United States of America, for a long time there has been interference from
                        abroad in internal Afghan affairs, including direct use of armed force. It
                        is completely obvious that the aim of this interference is the overthrow of
                        the democratic structure established as a result of the victory of the April
                        revolution in 1978. The Afghan people and its armed forces actively rebuffed
                        these aggressive acts and repelled encroachments against the democratic
                        achievements, sovereignty and national dignity of the new Afghanistan.
                        However, the acts of external aggression continue on an increasingly wider
                        scale; even now, armed units and weapons are being sent in from abroad.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances the leadership of the State of Afghanistan turned to
                        the Soviet Union for help and assistance in the struggle against external
                        aggression. The Soviet Union, proceeding from the common interests of
                        Afghanistan and our country in security matters—as set forth also in the
                        Treaty of Friendship, Good Neighborliness and Cooperation of 1978—and in the
                        interest of preserving peace in this region, responded positively to this
                        request by the leadership of Afghanistan and adopted a decision to send to
                        Afghanistan limited military contingents to carry out the tasks requested by
                        the leadership of Afghanistan. In doing this the Soviet Union also proceeds
                        on the basis of the appropriate provisions of the Charter of the United
                        Nations, in particular Article 51, which provides for the right of states to
                        individual and collective self-defense in repelling aggression and restoring
                        the peace.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government, in informing the Government of the U.S.A about this,
                        considers it necessary also to state that when the reasons evoking this
                        action of the Soviet Union cease to exist, it intends to withdraw its
                        military contingents from the territory of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union again emphasizes that, as before, its only desire is to see
                        Afghanistan an independent sovereign state carrying out a policy of
                        good-neighborliness and peace, firmly respecting and fulfilling its
                        international obligations, including those under the Charter of the United
                        Nations. End text.</p>
                    <p>4. After hearing Mal’tsev out I proceeded to make the points per <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> and left a non-paper.<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">Not further identified and not found.</note> In making
                        the oral point concerning the <pb n="278" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_278"/>safety of American personnel in Afghanistan, I referred to the loss of
                        Ambassador Spike <persName corresp="#p_DA_2">Dubs</persName> in Kabul.</p>
                    <p>5. Mal’tsev initially refused to address any of the questions I raised and
                        merely stated that the Soviet statement covered all the questions we had
                        asked. He stressed the confidential nature of the information conveyed to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and personally to the President.
                        After I pressed him further, Mal’tsev made the following comments. First, my
                        reference to the introduction of “large numbers” of Soviet forces was in
                        contrast to the Soviet statement which refers to “limited” military
                        contingents. Second, the allegation that these actions constitute direct
                        intervention in internal affairs and a threat to the peace does not
                        correspond to the actual situation because Soviet actions are in response to
                        the legal request of the Afghan Government in order to preserve peace in
                        that area. Mal’tsev concluded with the hope that, when I had studied the
                        text carefully, I would find all the answers to the questions we had raised.
                        He then said abruptly this was all he could say on the matter and that he
                        was under instructions only to convey the basic statement he had handed
                        me.</p>
                    <p>6. I told Mal’tsev I would convey the statement to my government and to the
                        President, but made clear that the Soviet statement did not answer the
                        questions we had raised, specifically regarding the size and suddenness of
                        Soviet troop movements and military equipment to Afghanistan. Also, it did
                        not explain the substantive change in Soviet intentions toward Afghanistan
                        which all these military actions implied. I also made it clear that if I
                        could have had an opportunity to discuss with him the serious issues these
                        actions raise, I would have asked who are these outsiders interfering in
                        Afghanistan’s affairs? Mal’tsev repeated that he believed the Soviet
                        statement was responsive and fully covered our questions. I repeated that I
                        considered the Soviet response inadequate.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> met to discuss the situation in
                        Southern Asia, especially in light of recent events in Afghanistan. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> briefed on the
                        fast-moving situation in Kabul, noting that the Soviet military presence in
                        the country was as high as perhaps 10,000. (S)</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion related to India and Pakistan.]</p>
                    <p>With regard to <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan:</hi></p>
                    <p><pb n="292" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_292"/>—The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> was briefed by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> on
                        certain covert action programs and discussed these. Official action was
                        postponed until a later <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>—Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> was causing difficulties in implementing a
                        more aggressive broadcasting program to cover the Afghan and related
                        situations. The Vice President asked for additional information so that he
                        could talk to <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>. It was also noted that a
                        recent comment made in the course of a <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                        meeting, on the need not to take propaganda initiatives that might cause
                        problems for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> ratification, did not
                        constitute guidance for the operating agencies. (S)</p>
                    <p>—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> urged strongly that
                        the Afghan situation not be raised in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        at this moment, lest it distract attention from our efforts to free the
                        hostages in Iran. There was general support. (S)</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the possibility of a dialogue with <hi rend="italic">Iraq</hi> be explored, based on security factors in order to avoid the
                        sterility of political discussions. It was noted that an American emissary
                        was already scheduled to visit Iraq. (S)</p>
                    <p>The meeting concluded with a discussion of how we should deal with the <hi rend="italic">Soviets</hi> concerning Afghanistan. There was widespread
                        concern that the Soviets may not appreciate the impact that their actions in
                        Afghanistan, Cambodia, and perhaps Angola, are having on American opinion. A
                        further demarche by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> was authorized on the basis of revisions made in the
                        draft instructions tabled by State.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">For

                            found.</note> Beyond that, however, it was felt that the Soviets had to
                        be dealt with more forcefully. The Vice President suggested that Majority
                        Leader <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName> might be asked to read
                        the riot act to the Soviet Chargé; the possibility of a hotline message to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> was also

                    <p>1. (S)—Entire text. This is an action message.</p>
                    <p>2. Like the rest of us, the Pakistanis are still in the process of assessing
                        the implications of the latest events in Kabul. <gloss target="#t_FonSec_1">FonSec</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> this morning gave me
                        preliminary <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> reaction about as follows:
                        the Soviet troops came in during last few days at request of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, but Sovs then doublecrossed <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. Sovs have now thrown into the
                        political arena the last elements of alternative (leftist) leadership, and
                        it remains to be seen whether these Parchamists can maintain the loyalty of
                        the army, despite their use of the label “true Khalq” to describe
                        themselves. It is “inevitable” that the army will suffer severe splits
                        despite Sov milit pressures.</p>
                    <p>It is [clear?] the new Parchamists are even more puppets of the Sovs than
                        previous leaders, and will be obedient servants of Moscow. There will likely
                        be an initial period of moderation, as after takeovers by <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, but later on Babrak and co. will revert to their
                        natural Communist extremism. The Pushtoonistan issue, on which Babrak
                        earlier was more militant than <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, will
                        later on become even more of an issue than it has been, and Pakistan expects
                        severe pressures along border and Afghan subversion in <gloss target="#t_NWFP_1">NWFP</gloss> and Baluchistan.</p>
                    <p>3. Our <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> sources suggest, inter alia, that
                        a 30/31 Dec. visit to Kabul by Fon Advisor <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> will be scrubbed.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy makers should consider
                        advisability very quick message to Paks, in next few days. Obviously broader
                        and longer-term reactions will have to await fundamental <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> decisions, but now is the time for giving
                        the Paks whatever can be given to reassure them of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        determination to prevent further Soviet expansion in this, or other,
                        regions.</p>
                    <p>5. Obviously from my limited perspective I cannot make firm judgements on the
                        elements that might be included in any message, but here are my
                        suggestions.</p>
                    <p>6. Several avenues are open for us. One would be for me to be authorized,
                        specifically, to reaffirm to the Government of Pakistan, at the highest
                        levels, our continuing commitment to Pakistan’s integrity <pb n="294" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_294"/>and sovereignty. I could put teeth in this
                        by reaffirming—in response to <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName>’s now three-month-old query—the applicability of our
                        1959 bilateral to the present situation in Afghanistan. We have really
                        dithered on this matter far too long, in my judgement—the Iran hostage
                        situation, elections in India, and the 21 November events here
                            notwithstanding.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">See <ref target="#d102fn10">footnote 10, Document 102</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>7. I could be authorized, perhaps, to take this a step further by formally
                        requesting, on behalf of my government, a consultation as envisaged under
                        the 1959 bilateral; events in Kabul over the last 72 hours would seem to me
                        to merit no less a reaction than this. For the request to originate with us
                        (instead of with Pakistan) demonstrates both concern and initiative on our
                        part to a Pakistani leadership made ever-more anxious about the ominous
                        Soviet presence and blatant “occupation” of a neighboring Islamic country,
                        at a time when they have reason to question the prospects for effective
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> support.</p>
                    <p>8. Such a démarche on my part would have even greater impact if at least a
                        portion of what I would be instructed to say could be cast in the form of a
                        letter to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, expressing concern
                        about the 25–28 Dec. developments in Kabul and soliciting Pakistan’s views
                        about the meaning of these developments.</p>
                    <p>9. I could envision a Presidential text that would include the following
                        thoughts: Quote: Dear President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>:
                        I am deeply distressed at the blatant exercise of Soviet power we have seen
                        in Kabul during the past several days. It is a cruel and brutal violation of
                        the norms of international discourse and relations, and it must not be
                        allowed to go unchallenged by the world community, most especially
                        Afghanistan’s fellow Islamic nations. For my part, I want to convey to you
                        my own sense of deep concern about the events taking place in Afghanistan
                        and to solicit earnestly your appreciation of developments there as we
                        assess in Washington and with our friends what precisely should be the
                        nature and character of the American and free world response. I want also to
                        reassure you, at this difficult moment for Pakistan, of the continuing
                        American commitment to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the
                        Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Finally, I wish to assure you of my desire for
                        the closest of consultations between our two friendly governments as we
                        assess how best to cope with the new threat to the region posed by the
                        Soviet actions in Afghanistan. Unquote.</p>
                    <p>10. While not attempting to get into longer-range matters for decision within
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> as we come to grips with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s power grab in Kabul, I nonetheless
                        want to add that we have exhausted the efficacy of oral diplomatic
                        assurances. We have been reassuring the Pakistanis <pb n="295" facs="0340" xml:id="pg_295"/>verbally ever since the April 1978 Communist takeover
                        in Kabul. As the waves of 27/28 Dec. events in Kabul wash down the Kabul
                        River into the Indus Valley, Pakistani paranoia and anxiety will naturally
                        rise. Words alone—in the absence of tangible follow-up actions which
                        demonstrate that our interest in the security of the region is matched by a
                        capability to respond to threats—will fall on deaf ears. At bare minimum, we
                        must look for practical steps in the security assistance area which we can
                        somehow pursue despite, and without torpedoing, our non-proliferation
                        policies. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> Paks are already aware from
                        Wash leak that we have put a temporary hold on any new military sales, an
                        action I believe was ill-advised when it was taken in early Dec and which
                        now appears ludicrous, as I wrote in a letter to Hal Saunders that should
                        reach him tomorrow. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>11. Failure to use Pakistan, as one vehicle in our response to Soviet actions
                        in Kabul—will produce a new set of pressures for further dilution of ties
                        with a seemingly helpless United States and for further accommodation with
                        Soviet power, not just here but through the region as a whole.</p>

                    <p>(S/[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not declassified</hi>]) Although
                        sporadic shooting continued on 28 December, Kabul is generally quiet
                        following yesterday’s violent overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government by Soviet combat troops and Afghan allies.
                        The city is securely in the hands of Soviet forces and armed civilians
                        associated with the new regime of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName>, a longtime pro-Soviet extreme Marxist. The government
                        has wasted no time in projecting a moderate image in public statements. <pb n="296" facs="0341" xml:id="pg_296"/>Although limited Soviet flight
                        activity occurred late on 27 December, no significant change in Soviet
                        military forces in Afghanistan has been reported.</p>
                    <p>(S/[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not declassified</hi>]) Soviet
                        troops and airborne combat vehicles in company with armed civilians remain
                        on guard at key intersections and buildings in Kabul. Additionally, four
                        MIG–21/Fishbeds have been oberved repeatedly overflying the city in a show
                        of force. This is the first air involvement during the past two days.
                        Civilian traffic is light but moving freely in the city.</p>
                    <p>(S/[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not declassified</hi>]) Within
                        hours of the Soviet takeover of the Radio Afghanistan building, the radio
                        broadcast <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s overthrow and
                        replacement by <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>. It
                        subsequently announced <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s
                        conviction by a revolutionary tribunal of crimes against the Afghan people
                        and his execution as a “fascist” and “agent of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> imperialism.” Consistent with the excellent planning and
                        execution of the coup, Babrak has hastened to announce a new government and
                        a series of conciliatory statements projecting a moderate image and
                        announcing yet another “new phase” of the revolution. Military officers
                        dominate the new government lineup and include the three military Cabinet
                        members purged by <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> in his
                        September takeover of government. Several have been promoted to colonel and
                        general ranks. Other military members are victims of past purges under the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> governments and are considered
                        popular with the armed forces. All the members identified so far are
                        leftists of varying persuasions.</p>
                    <p>(C) Among the other statements issued by the government are promises to
                        release all political prisoners, to negotiate solutions to the tribal
                        insurgency, to bring offenders of the past regime to justice, and an appeal
                        for assistance to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, which was
                        almost immediately accepted. Its foreign policy is announced as nonaligned,
                        but with an obvious tilt toward more radical international issues.</p>
                    <p>(S/[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not declassified</hi>]) Although
                        the coup represents a Soviet-inspired attempt to broaden the base of the
                        government so as to nurture a return to stability, the government faces
                        severe obstacles already. Babrak’s past reputation as an extreme Marxist,
                        his installation by Soviet troops and ready identification with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are likely to reinforce rather than
                        allay opposition to the Marxist government and the now expanded Soviet
                        presence. Despite the obvious bid for military allegiance, reports of
                        Soviets killing or capturing Afghan troops in the fighting may yet stir
                        military dissidence or opposition, especially in the countryside. A series
                        of purges and arrests with mass rotations of military commanders will be a
                        high priority of the new government. Overall the survival of Babrak’s
                        government will hinge indefinitely on the presence of Soviet Military
                        forces, which alone will reinforce his image as a Soviet puppet.</p>

                            was reported in telegram 8632 from Kabul, December 28. According to the
                            report, the announcement was made over Soviet-controlled Radio
                            Afghanistan at 0300, December 28. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                    <p>The new government is somewhat broader based than <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s, but all cabinet members and most ruling council
                        members announced so far were ministers in the government formed after the
                        Marxists seized power in April 1978. In addition to serving as Prime
                        Minister, Babrak will head the ruling party and the Revolutionary Council;

                        like Babrak is a member of the Parchamist faction of the party—will probably
                        be largely a figurehead.</p>
                    <p>Included in both the cabinet and the Council are two leftist military
                        officers, <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Abdul Qader</persName>—who was jailed
                        by former President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> in August 1978—and <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Mohammed Aslam Watanjar</persName>—who has been in
                        hiding since <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> overthrew <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> in September. Both are more
                        nationalist and less doctrinaire than Babrak.</p>
                    <p>There is little prospect that the government as now constituted can win
                        significant popular support. Even if the new rulers are able to convince the

                        was responsible for the most unpopular Marxist policies, they will still be

                        atheists. Babrak’s call for Soviet military assistance may give the
                        appearance of legality to Soviet military moves, but for most Afghans it
                        will only confirm that he is a Soviet puppet.</p>

                        The Soviet airlift to Kabul is continuing. As many as 3,800 Soviet airborne

                    <p>The President convened the National Security Council and it was agreed that
                        we would begin by discussing the situation in Afghanistan since it would be
                        important to communicate today with our European Allies.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> set forth five issues:
                        (1) our possible response; (2) how to encourage others to speak out against
                        the Soviet intervention; <pb n="299" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_299"/>(3) the
                        question of raising this issue at the United Nations. He said the United
                        States might not wish to do so because we are pursuing the hostage issue at
                        the Security Council, but perhaps the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> or
                        China would raise the issue at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>; (4)
                        the question of our support for the Afghan resistance. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we have a revised
                        Presidential Finding which will be presented to the President shortly; and
                        (5) the question of our cooperation with Pakistan which is directly related
                        to the situation brought about by the Soviet intervention in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had read the message from the German Government
                        regarding Allied consultation and agreed that the North Atlantic Council
                        would be a better forum for us to pursue this issue in the first instance
                        than the United Nations.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">The message from the

                            session in Brussels on December 29 to discuss Afghanistan. During the
                            meeting, <persName corresp="#p_LJ_1">Luns</persName> appealed for
                            solidarity among the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies in

                            France, Italy, and Canada. The participants reaffirmed <persName corresp="#p_LJ_1">Luns</persName>’s call for Allied solidarity and a
                            global response designed to “discourage further adventurism” by the
                            Soviet Union. The representatives agreed that each of their respective
                            countries needed to review bilateral relations with the Soviet Union,
                            although “most felt that institutional elements of détente such as
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, disarmament negotiations,

                            consultations as “useful,” and stated: “with exception of the French,
                            who stuck to the line that this should be a Soviet-world community issue
                            rather than an East-West issue, all other allies are looking to us for
                            guidance and seem to be planning to follow our lead.” <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> further noted that the <gloss target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> meeting “took a considerably tougher
                            line” than the London consultations regarding the question of how to
                            deal with the Soviets and how to support Pakistan following the Soviet
                            intervention. (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski

                        emphasizing the importance of our Allies speaking out publicly and to the
                        Soviets on this matter.</p>
                    <p>The President asked on what basis the North Atlantic Council might be

                        it met on an emergency basis upon the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He
                        added that it would also be important to consult on a broader basis than
                        just with the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance in this

                        North Atlantic Council meet on this issue. He was reluctant to push this
                        into the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> when we were dealing with Iran
                        at the Security Council, but he thought the rest of the world will be
                        reluctant to condemn the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> thought that more
                        countries might be prepared to act than in the case of Iran, since
                        Afghanistan had no oil. The President pointed out, however, that we have
                        been warning the world for several weeks that there has been a buildup of an
                        imminent threat, and there has been no reaction from anyone.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that the Germans had been told by the Soviets this
                        morning that they intervened to stop an invasion of Afghanistan, but when
                        asked, the Soviets would not identify which country was committing the
                        “external aggression.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State endorsed the idea of calling the four European
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> suggested that, if the
                        North Atlantic Council were to be called into session, it should be done at
                        a high political level since the Council was already planning to meet at the
                        Permanent Representatives level. The President agreed, and the Secretary of
                        State said we could work out the arrangements later. It was also agreed that
                        the President would call the Italian President.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> suggested that we will
                        need to be able to indicate what we want our Allies to do when we talk to
                        them. The President said that we could not go through the night without a
                        public response and contact with the Allies. Otherwise, the Soviets will be
                        out persuading everyone that their action was legitimate, and there would be
                        no response from us.</p>
                    <p>It was therefore agreed that we should send messages to give groups of
                        countries identified by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>—our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        Allies; the Non-Aligned Movement leaders; other key countries around the
                        world such as China; and key United Nations members. It was agreed that
                        messages should be prepared immediately by a working group <pb n="301" facs="0346" xml:id="pg_301"/>of State and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and to arrange the telephone calls to the Allied leaders
                        and President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">The Department sent two telegrams to all <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> capitals and other diplomatic and
                            consular posts, December 28. The first, telegram 333161, described the
                            events of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan detailing the airlift, the
                            military occupation of Kabul, the execution of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, and the elevation of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> as the new President in order to
                            brief host governments. The second, telegram 333359, cited “first-hand
                            evidence of a direct Soviet role” in the execution of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and replacement with <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>. The telegram also described the
                            Soviet action as a “subject of grave concern for the entire
                            international community and not just those in South Asia.” The telegram
                            asked all addressees to share any available information regarding the
                            crisis in Afghanistan and instructed the posts to encourage host
                            governments “to make their profound concern about the Soviet role in
                            Afghanistan clear immediately to the Soviet Union both in Moscow and in
                            capitals and through their public statements.” In a concluding section
                            for “Moslem and non-aligned countries,” the Department asked the
                            Embassies to reaffirm to their host governments that the United States
                            had long respected Afghanistan’s non-alignment; the Soviet invasion
                            limited Afghanistan’s independence, that the action raised “grave
                            questions” for the Non-Aligned Movement; and that “we appreciate that
                            Moslem nations in particular would be deeply concerned about Soviet
                            efforts to impose a regime with an alien ideology upon an unwilling
                            Moslem populace, irrespective of the professions of such a regime to
                            respect Islam.” Finally, anticipating host governments would cite Soviet
                            insistence that the Afghan Government invited the Soviet intervention,
                            the Department instructed Embassies that the United States has “no
                            evidence” to support that claim. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                        Finding approved earlier in the day by the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">Neither minutes nor a summary
                            of conclusions of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meeting was
                            found.</note> It would enable us to accelerate shipment of arms to the
                        Afghan rebels via Saudi Arabia. The President inquired regarding the likely
                        response of the Saudis and Pakistanis, and <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> replied that he expects it will be very positive.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that we were all
                        agreed that greater support to the Afghan rebels makes sense. His only
                        question was whether it was enough.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> asked if there were any
                        possibility the rebels could take over the government. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said they would not have any prospect
                        of being able to take over the government. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said they can hang on and make it
                        costly for the Soviet Union. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said the key variables in the success of the
                        Afghan resistance is Pakistani support and our attitude.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that news analyses said the Soviets would have little
                        hope of putting down the rebellion even if they moved in the 50,000 troops
                        on the Soviet border. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        said he had a different view. If we do nothing to help the rebels, then the
                        psychological impact—both on the Pakistanis and on the Afghans—of isolation
                        could be quite adverse and dry up support for their insurgency. Moreover,
                        the Soviets are likely to try to garrison the cities and free the <pb n="302" facs="0347" xml:id="pg_302"/>regular Afghan armies to pursue the
                        rebels in the field, and that might be more effective.</p>
                    <p>The President said he supported the Finding.<note n="6" xml:id="d107fn6">The
                            Presidential Finding, signed by <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> on December 28, listed Afghanistan as the scope,
                            with the description: “Provide lethal military equipment either directly
                            or through third countries to the Afghan opponents of the Soviet
                            intervention in Afghanistan. Provide selective training, conducted
                            outside of Afghanistan, in the use of such equipment either directly or
                            via third country intermediaries.” (National Security Council, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration Intelligence
                            Files, Box I–047, Afghanistan: 11 Sep 1979–22 Jul 1980)</note></p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that the new group installed by the Soviets may be as
                        unpopular or even more so than the former one. The Secretary of Defense
                        noted, however, that if only isolated pockets of resistance remain, they may
                        be successful.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that the Soviet
                        Union had been reasonably successful at counter-insurgency efforts. They had
                        had success in Latvia, Lithuania and the Ukraine, with their strategy being
                        primarily the holding of the cities.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> noted in this
                        connection that the more elite Afghan army units now guarding the cities may
                        be released to fight the insurgents. This would provide forces with better
                        morale which are less likely to desert and turn over their weapons to the
                        insurgents. This, in turn, makes our aid all the more important.</p>
                    <p>On the question of the Presidential Finding, the President said that he hoped
                        that these Findings would be drawn with an eye toward the greatest possible
                        flexibility and generality emphasizing the positive goals we hope to achieve
                        in the most constructive terms.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> then indicated that we
                        should discuss the question of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        approaches to the Soviet Union directly. The President indicated that he
                        wishes a very strong message, with no holds barred, sent from him to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> and an equally tough
                        public statement made.</p>
                    <p>The President said that this issue transcends <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. He would not acquiesce to the Soviet action just because
                        it might give comfort and assistance to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> opponents in the Congress. He said that the message to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> should point out that
                        their action was a “threat to the peace” which casts “grave doubts upon our
                        relationship” and which was “a direct violation of the principles agreed to
                        in 1972.”<note n="7" xml:id="d107fn7">See <ref target="#d113">Document

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> asked what our ultimate
                        aim was in the Afghan situation. The President replied to get the Soviets to
                        withdraw. The Secretaries of State and Defense and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said it was to make it as
                        costly as possible for the Soviets. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> added that we want to use the issue as a rallying
                        point for our policies in the area. <pb n="303" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_303"/>The President concluded that our maximum goal, however, was to get the
                        Soviets out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> noted that
                        this, however, was not likely to be successful.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that the Soviets had created a traditional buffer
                        state into a satellite. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> agreed and noted that it was a buffer state that
                        protected a tier of three states along the Indian Ocean. Thus, their action
                        was a very dangerous step strategically, and we must send them a message
                        which reflects this broader concern.</p>
                    <p>As for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we do not link the
                        intervention with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, but we are not
                        going to be silenced by the possible domestic reaction and its impact on
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The President agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> said that a private
                        message to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> would not be
                        adequate from the standpoint of our public position. It was agreed that we
                        would develop a brief public statement for the President’s use as well as a
                        more formal statement that could be released by the White House.
                        (Subsequently, the President decided to make only his own statement.)<note n="8" xml:id="d107fn8"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            spoke to reporters at 4:30 p.m. on December 28 about the hostages in
                            Iran and the situation in Afghanistan. For the text of his remarks, see
                                <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, 1979</hi>, Book II, p. 2287. He also
                            addressed the nation on the crisis in Afghanistan in a live speech from
                            the Oval Office at 9 p.m., January 4. Text of the speech is printed in
                                <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, 1980,</hi> pp. 21–24.</note></p>
                    <p>The Vice President suggested the Soviets were trying to hurt the President’s
                        reelection chances with this move. General <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName> said that Afghanistan itself is a loss and of no
                        particular help to the Soviets strategically. In his judgment, they were
                        obviously looking beyond it and to cause perceptions of their willingness to
                        use power and are seeking a stepping stone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said, on the other hand, the Soviets
                        were faced with a hostile Islamic state on their border. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> agreed with that view. He said that
                        the Soviets were unwilling to face the political damage if Afghanistan went
                        down the drain.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded by saying we should push this issue vigorously and be
                        prepared to go all the way with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> if
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the question of support for the Afghan insurgents, Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> said we should be clear
                        that the objective of getting the Soviets out is unachievable and much
                        beyond the program of support he was recommending. That program will
                        ultimately cost only $10 million and will barely keep the insurgency
                        going.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Pakistan, the Secretary of State outlined the steps recommended by
                        the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>: first, a high-level mission to
                        consult with the Pakistanis; second, to resume military sales; third,
                        because we cannot sell on credit to Pakistan because of the Symington
                        Amendment, it <pb n="304" facs="0349" xml:id="pg_304"/>would be necessary to
                        work with the Saudis to help finance Pakistani purchases.<note n="9" xml:id="d107fn9">See <ref target="#d102">Documents 102</ref> and <ref target="#d103">103</ref>. The high-level mission to Pakistan was led
                            by <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>. See <ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>. The Symington Amendment to the Foreign
                            Assistance Act of 1961, passed June 1976, gave Congress authority “to
                            deny <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance to governments
                            involved in the sale and purchase of nuclear reprocessing material
                            unless such transactions are subject to adequate multilateral safeguards
                            against diversion to weapons use.” (International Security Assistance
                            and Arms Control Act of 1976, <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>
                            94–329; 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976)) <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> found Pakistan in violation of the Symington
                            Amendment and cut off economic and military aid, save food assistance,
                            in April 1979. On the decision of how to support Pakistan in light of
                            the Symington Amendment, see <ref target="#d151">Document
                            151</ref>.</note> In this connection, the sale of Gerring destroyers to
                        the Pakistanis would not particularly help them against the Soviets but
                        would be of enormous political help in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that the House
                        has said that these destroyers should be saved for our naval reserve, but he
                        thought he could get around the problem. The President noted that Sadat was
                        anxious for some destroyers. The Secretary of State noted that these Gerring
                        destroyers were offered to him but, because of their condition, he didn’t
                        want them.</p>
                    <p>On the economic side, the Secretary spelled out the other recommendation: an
                        increase in PL 480 assistance and more relief for the Afghan refugees. On
                        nuclear policy, the Secretary stressed we should reaffirm our present
                        position and seek a reaffirmation of their present position; specifically,
                        that they would not build nuclear weapons, they would not transfer sensitive
                        technology, and there would be no nuclear tests during <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s regime.</p>
                    <p>The President asked who would head the mission to Pakistan. The Secretary
                        suggested Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> and someone from the Defense Department.</p>
                    <p>The President said our emissary should tell <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> that we are bound by law on the non-proliferation issue
                        and can’t change it, but let’s try to get together on Afghanistan and work
                        out the non-proliferation issue later.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        said Pakistani Adviser to the President for Foreign Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>, had asked him whether we would
                        sell military equipment to Pakistan if the situation in Afghanistan
                        deteriorated. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had

                        Government in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: Most observers have consistently downplayed the possibility that
                        Moscow would support—much less back militarily—the overthrow of the Khalqi
                        regime in favor of one led by the former Parcham wing of the Afghan leftist
                        movement. This skepticism flowed from a conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> and his Parchamists were
                        really no different from their Khalqi rivals, that the great mass of the
                        Afghan population considered both groups equally evil Communists and
                        atheists, and that Babrak himself was probably too pro-Soviet in Afghan eyes
                        to be credible as a genuine nationalist. Thus, the general feeling was that
                        a “Babrak alternative” would not be able to solve any of the problems which
                        the Khalqis themselves had been unable to solve, and that Babrak’s apparent
                        pro-Soviet views would result in an even narrower political base for the
                        Parchamists than the Khalqis had in their worst days.</p>
                    <p>3. Persuasive reasons for Moscow’s decision to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> and install Babrak are,
                        therefore, difficult to discern, since we presume that the Soviets are also
                        aware of the handicaps a Parchamist regime would encounter, especially its
                        total lack of legitimacy in view of the Soviet military action installing
                        them in power. The Soviets may have concluded that a policy of risking
                        potential disaster but also potential success was preferable to the disaster
                        they could see looming if they had continued to back <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. A demonstration of support for <pb n="306" facs="0351" xml:id="pg_306"/>ideological brethren, and a
                        willingness to run risks in order to preclude the demise of a Socialist
                        revolution may also have played a part in Moscow’s decision. Whatever the
                        case, an active Soviet military presence here would seem to be a long-term
                        prospect, and we consider it likely that the Soviets will expand their
                        occupation throughout the country. End of summary.</p>
                    <p>4. In considering future political developments here, one scenario we have
                        consistently considered as plausible yet unlikely has been a Soviet
                        supported (perhaps with direct military force) seizure of power from the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> led Khalqis by some group of
                        “alternate” leftist leadership. Because it was presumed that such a
                        Soviet-supported group would necessarily be ideologically and politically
                        acceptable to Moscow, the exiled Parcham wing of the Afghan leftist
                        movement—including its long-time number one, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>—was viewed as a prime contender for this role.
                        During the years before the Afghan Left seized power in April 1978, the
                        Parcham wing was generally believed to have a larger following among Afghan
                        intelligentsia, and was supposed to be popular among leftist university
                        students. The Khalqi faction, on the other hand, focussed its recruitment on
                        the military, a background which explains why the Khalqis under <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> prevailed in their struggle against the Parcham in the
                        first few months following the April 1978 revolution. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> and some of his followers
                        were also generally believed to be more pro-Soviet than were the Khalqi
                        leaders, although information on this point was difficult to verify. Thus,
                        some observers had believed that Moscow would quite readily throw its weight
                        behind the Parchamists should the Khalqis falter seriously in their efforts
                        to build a revolutionary Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>5. Most observers, however, downplayed the possibility of the foregoing
                        scenario, principally because it appeared to hold little promise for solving
                        any of the serious difficulties being confronted by the leftist party in
                        power. Most Afghans, certainly the mass of the population, see no difference
                        between the two leftist groups, and consider them as equally evil,
                        Communists and atheists. Informed Afghans and foreigners also believed that
                        past differences between the two factions were based more on personal
                        animosities than on opposing doctrinal views, revolutionary zeal, etc.
                        Babrak’s perceived pro-Soviet ardor added to doubts that he would represent
                        an any more viable or popular alternative should the Khalqi position become
                        drastically eroded. Thus, this particular analysis, to which we adhered,
                        concluded that the accession of Babrak and the Parcham would have virtually
                        no ameliorating impact on the hostility of the insurgents fighting for the
                        overthrow of a Communist regime in Kabul, nor would it present any broader
                        appeal to the Afghan middle or upper class, with the possible exception of a
                            <pb n="307" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_307"/>small group of university
                        students. This particular advantage, however, would perhaps be
                        counterbalanced by the loss of support within the Khalqi-leaning military
                        which a Parcham accession would entail. Despite the events of the past
                        eighteen hours, we see no reason to alter this analysis, and can only
                        conclude that Babrak will have no better chance to advance the revolution
                        than did his predecessors, and that his base of support could even be much
                        narrower than <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s in his last
                        days.</p>
                    <p>6. The means by which Babrak came to power virtually guarantees instability,
                        strife, and bloodshed here. By having ridden to power on the guns of the
                        Soviet Army, Babrak will hardly have many admirers among Afghans, and this
                        episode could conceivably provide the catalyst the various insurgent groups
                        need to form their own united front against the “new” central government. A
                        delayed reaction against the Soviet forces may still explode. The cohesion
                        of what remains of the Afghan Army in the field is also questionable, as we
                        anticipate that many individuals and units may wonder why they should
                        continue fighting fellow Afghans for the sake of a leadership forcibly
                        imposed by Moscow. A collapse of the army cannot be ruled out.</p>
                    <p>7. Because we must presume that the Soviets are aware of the risks of the
                        “Parchamist option,” we have difficulty discerning convincing reasons for
                        Moscow’s decision to intervene militarily to overthrow one regime and impose
                        another, a move which hardly enhances Soviet prestige around the world and,
                        in Afghanistan would appear a blunder of great magnitude. It could be, of
                        course, that the Soviets were in a desperate quandary: for example, to
                        continue with <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> represented likely
                        disaster, while forcing a change in the Afghan regime may have been viewed
                        as at least holding out the possibility of improving the chances of the
                        revolution, despite the real potential disaster outlined above. At the same
                        time, the episode may well underscore Moscow’s commitment that the world’s
                        “correlation of forces” now favors the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, thereby demonstrating to the world the risks the Kremlin
                        is willing to run in order to preclude reversal of a socialist revolution,
                        especially on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s borders. Whether
                        or not the Soviet action was designed as some sort of “signal” related to
                        the Iranian or other international situation is for others to assess, but we
                        think it was not, primarily because beating up on the Afghan Army does not
                        necessarily represent a feat of arms that would [garble—concern?] major or
                        even medium powers.</p>
                    <p>8. Despite the uncertainties surrounding Moscow’s decision to undertake this
                        aggressive action—and we assume <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah
                            Amin</persName> believed the thousands of Soviet troops airlifted into
                        Kabul were destined to assist him, not put him in his grave—an active Soviet
                        military role in Afghanistan in support of the puppet government of Babrak
                            <pb n="308" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_308"/><persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> is probably a long-term prospect. In view of last
                        night’s actions, we sadly anticipate Soviet troops will now overrun all
                        important cities and strategic areas and will directly enter the fray
                        against the insurgents.</p>

                    <p>The President used the talking points at Tab A almost verbatim except for #4,
                        the one on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">Attached but not printed. The talking points are as
                            follows: “1. We regard the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan as an
                            extremely grave development. 2. It has profound consequences for the
                            stability of the entire region. 3. We believe that it is essential that
                            we make this action as politically costly as possible to the Soviet
                            Union and to that end will be approaching a number of governments,
                            particularly the non-aligned and the Muslim countries, to speak out. 4.
                            We are not going to be deterred from making an issue of this because of
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The Soviets have clearly
                            made a decision that this intervention is more important than <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. 5. We also are prepared to carry it
                            all the way to the United Nations; however, because of our own efforts
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> with regard to the hostages,
                            we would appreciate it if others could take the initiative there. 6. We
                            also believe the North Atlantic Council should meet immediately at a
                            high political level to assess the matter and coordinate allied
                            strategy. (For France: I hope that France can work within the North
                            Atlantic Council and show solidarity on this issue.)” For the approach
                            to other countries (point 3), see <ref target="#d107fn4">footnote 4,
                                Document 107</ref>.</note> He put that issue in the following way:
                        “We are going ahead with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        independently of what happens in Afghanistan, but we are not going to allow
                        our concern about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        <pb n="309" facs="0354" xml:id="pg_309"/>to interfere with our strong
                        condemnation of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.” (<persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>’s response to this line was “I
                        think that is appropriate.”) The President also told each of the leaders
                        that he was going to send a very strong message to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> on Afghanistan, and he invited
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName>, but none of the
                        others, to do the same. (C)</p>
                    <p>As you know, <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CF_2">Cossiga</persName> all immediately agreed to a meeting of deputy
                        foreign ministers this weekend under <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        auspices, but <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> said “no.” He
                        did not favor the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> structure for this
                        meeting because Afghanistan was not in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Treaty area. Thus, it was not proper to use the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> instrument in this case. A meeting in
                        London of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> members, but not under
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> sponsorship, was the
                            compromise.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref target="#d107fn2">footnote 2, Document 107</ref>.</note> (C)</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> made the
                        important point that we must take the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
                        seriously because of its impact on Pakistan, Iran and the <hi rend="italic">the Gulf States</hi>. The latter, said <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>, would certainly feel threatened if there were no
                        Western reaction to the situation in Afghanistan. (C)</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CF_2">Cossiga</persName> will say that the Government

                    <p>8668. <gloss target="#t_Subj_1">Subj</gloss>: (<gloss target="#t_LOU_1">LOU</gloss>) Some Thoughts on Whether To Recognize the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> Regime.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. As the Department considers the question of recognizing the new regime in
                        Afghanistan, I would like to add some thoughts for your consideration.
                        First, it seems to me that the paramount factor in this [garble—equation?]
                        is the means by which the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> regime came to power. Based on the views of our
                        Mission officers, and those too of the French and Italian Embassies who have
                        consulted us, the Soviet forces which had been airlifted into Kabul over the
                        past two days, launched last night a surprise attack on the Afghan Army
                        units guarding <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> installations in the
                        city, and spared no force in destroying them. The struggle was strictly one
                        of Soviet military vs. Afghan units. Thus, Babrak now holds his position
                        solely [due] to the might of the Soviet Army, a consideration which casts
                        doubt on whether this regime has actual or ethical legitimacy or can ever
                        really rule this country. Though the Soviets got away with such tactics in
                        Eastern Europe after World War II, I doubt they can duplicate it here in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>3. Secondly, following the April 1978 revolution, there was some
                        discussion—in the context of “recognition”—of whether the overthrow of Daoud
                        had been launched by Afghans or by connivance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> After examination of
                        available evidence, we and the <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss>.
                        generally agreed that the Khalqi regime did appear to have organized and
                        launched its own revolution, although the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> undoubtedly had helped the conspirators clandestinely over
                        the years with advice on subversion and secret training. That conclusion of
                        an indigenous revolution, I think played some part in our decision to carry
                        on business with the Khalqis. That argument hardly holds now with a regime
                        which was brought to power only because of Soviet military intervention.</p>
                    <p>4. Thirdly, I recall that generally it is <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> practice with respect to recognition to consider the key
                        factor to be whether the new government exercises effective control over the
                        country. If it does, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <pb n="311" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_311"/>Government generally extends
                        recognition and issues a diplomatic note with the appropriate language. As I
                        mentioned in a cable sent two days ago,<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3">Not
                            found.</note> on the eve of the “Babrak Soviet coup,” we here had doubts
                        regarding the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime’s effective
                        control over the countryside, and particularly its legitimacy in the light
                        of its action of permitting Soviet troops to enter the country, presumably
                        to keep itself in power. After viewing the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s deplorable action of yesterday, [we] harbor even greater
                        doubts about the new regime’s legitimacy. Moreover, it is by no means clear
                        that the Babrak/Soviet hold on power is firm anywhere beyond Kabul.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, as regards the new regime’s attitude towards the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, we have only skimpy information so far.
                        Babrak’s initial speech contained the accusation that the “traitor”
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was an agent of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and of “fascist American imperialism.” Not
                        surprisingly, Babrak threw the usual bouquets at the Soviet Union and other
                        Socialist countries. Babrak also requested further “economic and military”
                        assistance from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Based on my
                        assessment that there really is little to choose substantively between the
                        Khalqis and their Parchamist successors, I have no reason to believe at this
                        point that the new regime will be any more kindly disposed to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests and programs than its
                        predecessor.</p>
                    <p>6. On balance, therefore, I come down on the side of breaking or suspending
                        diplomatic relations with Afghanistan. I think that we may have more to lose
                        in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> prestige globally and internally
                        too, were we to maintain a Mission here than withdrawing it. I favor however
                        no hasty action on our part, and would counsel discreet prior consultation
                        with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies. My surmise is that
                        this regime will not be looking for “recognition” from anybody, as it will
                        probably allege that what has happened merely represents an internal tiff
                        within the party in power and in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>7. By septel, I have recommend a temporary modest phasedown of <gloss target="#t_Amcit_1">Amcit</gloss> personnel.<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">In telegram 8653 from Kabul, December 28, <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> recommended the temporary closure of <gloss target="#t_USAID_1">USAID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USICA_1">USICA</gloss> offices at the Embassy.

                        must ask that this decision be closely held, and be implemented without
                        fanfare, until almost all personnel and our personal effects are gone. None
                        of us here relishes the prospect of losing our effects as a result of an
                        angry reaction by a fickle, hostile government.</p>

                        said it is right to think on those lines. Pakistan considers itself an ally
                        and a great friend of the United States. Our past association contains many
                        instances of mutual respect and assistance according to our capabilities. It
                        is encouraging that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is still the

                            Actions</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>To emphasize the outrageous and unprecedented nature of the Soviet coup in
                        Afghanistan would be to belabor the obvious. Any failure to respond
                        adequately on our part would be perceived as glaring weakness by our Allies,
                        by the non-aligned, and especially in the Persian Gulf. The domestic
                        near-consensus on Iran could evaporate over Afghanistan. It is therefore
                        imperative that we not only act to counter what the Soviets have done in
                        Afghanistan, but that we are perceived as having done so.</p>
                    <p>The speciousness and bald-faced arrogance of the Soviet action can hardly be
                        exaggerated. There was no need, for example, to announce <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s immediate execution, which gives the
                        lie to the Soviet assertion that they were invited in by the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government. Furthermore, the use of
                        the recently-signed Friendship Treaty with Afghanistan as the juridical
                        basis for their actions creates a logical implication that the Soviets could
                        equally undertake the overthrow of any of the ten governments with whom they
                        now have such treaties, e.g. India. Equally to the point, would Sadat and
                        Siad have thrown out the Soviets so cavalierly if they had felt that one
                        serious Soviet option was to fly in an army and set up their rivals in
                        power?</p>
                    <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Public Posture</hi></p>
                    <p>We have no real option of downplaying the significance of the Soviet action.
                        We need a clear, sharp and unequivocal response, which should be given full
                        play by all our communications media. The themes we should stress are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>a. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was assassinated
                        within two days of the Soviet invasion makes a mockery of Moscow’s claims
                        that it was invited in by the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>
                        Government. That <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s family was
                        killed along with him shows the kind of people we are dealing with.</p>
                    <p><pb n="315" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_315"/>b. The fact that the Soviets cite
                        their Friendship Treaty with Afghanistan as the basis for interference in
                        the Afghans’ internal affairs implies that the Soviets have a similar right
                        in all other countries with whom they have friendship treaties.</p>
                    <p>c. This is the first use by the Soviets of their armed forces in a combat
                        situation outside the Soviet Bloc since the Second World War and is
                        therefore an extremely ominous precedent. Do the Soviets claim such
                        universal rights in all other areas? How can this be squared with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter?</p>
                    <p>d. Afghanistan had been <hi rend="italic">the</hi> classic buffer state for
                        the past 150 years. The Soviets had no legitimate national interest in
                        taking such actions. The fact of the matter was that the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> Government was, by any reasonable
                        standard, pro-Soviet, as was the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> Government which preceded it. Furthermore, the Afghan
                        Government which existed before the April 1978 coup was not anti-Soviet in
                        nature and maintained cordial state-to-state relations with Moscow. All the
                        military needs of that regime, for example, were supplied by the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>e. Does the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine apply
                        to the entire Third World? What are the limits to the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine? As Soviet force
                        projection capabilities increase over the coming decades, they will have the
                        capability to mount such an action anywhere in the world. Is this a
                        tolerable situation for the international community?</p>
                    <p>f. We are extremely concerned at the human toll which the Soviet-supported
                        combat is taking. There are 350,000 refugees now in Pakistan, and we would
                        not be surprised to see that number rise to half a million in the near
                        future. Thus, as in Cambodia and in so many other countries since World War
                        II, the Soviets are creating another enormous refugee problem, this time in
                        South Asia and among an overwhelmingly Muslim population. The United States
                        is prepared to do its utmost to assist the Afghan refugees with humanitarian
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>g. The Soviet Union is atheistic by doctrine and has published enormous
                        amounts of anti-religious and anti-Muslim literature. The US, on the other
                        hand, firmly believes in religious freedom and enshrines it in our
                        Constitution. Three million Muslims practice their religion freely in the
                        US. In the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Muslims have been
                        persecuted, mosques have been closed, and religion has been discouraged. In
                        Soviet Azerbaijan, for example, there are only 24 officially recognized
                        mosques now operating, whereas before the Revolution of 1917 there were
                        several thousand in operation.</p>
                    <p>h. In sum, replacement of one government by another through the use of armed
                        force, as done by the Soviets in Afghanistan, is an egregious violation of
                        normal international standards of behavior, sets a very dangerous precedent,
                        and is regarded by the US as reckless adventurism. We call on all nations,
                        and particularly nations with significant <pb n="316" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_316"/>Muslim populations, to appeal to the Soviet Union to
                        allow the Afghan people to settle its own problems in line with the
                        principle of no interference in the internal affairs of other nations.</p>
                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Other Possible Actions</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Dispatch a high-level mission to give the Pakistanis the kind of assurance
                        they need to bolster their confidence and to assist us in our support of the
                        Afghan insurgents.</p>
                    <p>2. Dispatch a mission to investigate conditions in the refugee camps in
                        Pakistan, which would presumably result in additional US and international
                        assistance to support the refugees.</p>
                    <p>3. Explore with all pertinent governments the stepping up of covert
                        assistance to the insurgents and in the process commit ourselves to
                        maximizing such assistance.</p>
                    <p>4. Form a special committee in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to
                        examine threats to the peace outside the Treaty area.</p>
                    <p>5. Liberalize our arms sale policy to the sub-Continent.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Other Possible Actions in the US-Soviet
                        Context</hi></p>
                    <p>The above actions might be enough domestically and in world opinion if the
                        Soviets are basically unsuccessful in tamping down the insurgency and thus
                        become mired in a Vietnam-type situation. But if they are successful, these
                        actions will not be sufficient and we will look weak and ineffectual. In any
                        case, the Soviet action in Afghanistan almost demands that we take specific
                        bilateral steps to indicate our abhorrence. Among those steps which the
                        President might consider (and it is too early to make definite decisions on
                        this score) are the following:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss></hi>. If, after consultation with <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName> and others, it is determined that
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> no longer has a chance of early
                        passage, the Administration could consider withdrawing it unilaterally,
                        while waiting for a better climate, although still committed to the fact
                        that the Treaty is in our basic interest and still favoring ratification by
                        the Senate.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Grain Sales</hi>. The Administration could suspend the
                        US-Soviet Grain Agreement<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">The agreement was
                            signed in 1972 and renewed in 1975.</note> or simply suspend all sales
                        of grain to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for the indeterminate
                        future. This would require Congressional authorization to purchase and store
                        the excess grain.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Technology Transfer and Licensing</hi>. We could
                        announce a much tougher policy regarding technology transfer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and a closer look at licenses for
                        petroleum-related exports.</p>
                    <p><pb n="317" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_317"/>4. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss></hi>. We could announce that we do not
                        intend to introduce legislation giving <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>
                        to the Soviet Union during the current session of Congress.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Postponement of US-Soviet Trade Council</hi>. We could
                        announce the postponement of the next session of the US-Soviet Trade
                        Council, scheduled to meet in Washington April 16.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Tighten Up <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                            Procedures</hi>. We could announce that we are undertaking with our
                        Allies a review of current <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                        procedures with a view to tightening them.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Expulsion of a Large Group of Soviet Agents</hi>. We
                        could identify and arrest 50 to 100 Soviet <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> agents in the US, making clear to the Soviets that any
                        retaliatory action on their part would mean further expulsions by us at a
                        rate of two Soviets for one American, i.e. the current ratio of Soviet
                        Embassy personnel in the US to Americans in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, leaving out the 550 Soviets at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> (which makes one-for-one expulsion entirely
                        unsatisfactory and unreciprocal to us).</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Withdrawal of Ambassador</hi>. We could (and probably
                        should) recall <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> for
                        consultations. (<persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>’s absence is
                        obviously not entirely medical in nature.)</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Broaden Security Relationships</hi>. The US could
                        undertake new security relationships with Oman, Somalia, and Turkey, i.e.
                        three Muslim countries.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Broadcasting</hi>. The US could announce increased
                        broadcasts to Western Asia and to the Muslim portions of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">China</hi>. In conjunction with the <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> visit, the US could let it be known
                        that we have agreed not only to the sale of certain high technology items to
                        China, but to the sale of over-the-horizon radar and anti-tank
                        missiles—clearly defensive weapons—as well. We could explain that this was
                        done explicitly in light of the Soviet action in Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">See <ref target="#d149">Documents 149</ref> and <ref target="#d150">150</ref>.</note> Future arms sale to China, we could
                        add, would be on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Removal of Inhibitions on Covert Actions</hi>. The US
                        could ask for revision of all of the legislative inhibitions on our ability
                        to conduct covert actions anywhere in the world.</p>
                    <p>In sum, Soviet negative reaction to various protests and expostulations,
                        including ours, is completely predictable. These were taken into
                        consideration by the Soviets before they made their move. This is an event
                        of such importance that a strong and vivid US response must be made to it,
                        and not just in terms of Soviet action in Afghanistan itself, but in terms
                        of overall US-Soviet relations. The Soviets must be <pb n="318" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_318"/>made to understand that this was a very expensive
                        invasion and that it should not set a precedent for future action. The
                        American people and the Congress should be sympathetic to tough responses by
                        the President, especially if the Soviet actions in Afghanistan are cast in
                        the proper light, i.e. the Soviets have kicked us while we were down, and we
                        do not intend to stand for it.</p>

                        <salute>Dear President <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I want to insure that you have fully weighed the ramifications of the Soviet
                        actions in Afghanistan, which we regard as a clear threat to the peace. You
                        should understand that these actions could mark a fundamental and
                        long-lasting turning point in our relations. Taken without any previous
                        discussion with us, they constitute in our view a clear violation of the
                        Basic Principles on Relations, which you signed in 1972.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">See <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>My Government can in no way accept the Soviet Government’s explanation,
                        conveyed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> on
                        December 27, that Soviet military forces were sent into Afghanistan at the
                        request of the leadership of that country.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> The facts of the
                        matter clearly show that these same Soviet forces were employed to overthrow
                        that established government of Afghanistan and to impose a new government,
                        which has brutally executed the former President and, reportedly, his
                        family.</p>
                    <p>Large-scale movements of military units into a sovereign country are always a
                        legitimate matter of concern to the international community. When such
                        military forces are those of a superpower, and are then used to depose an
                        existing government and impose another, there are obvious adverse
                        implications both for the region and for the world at large. We note with
                        the utmost seriousness that this is the first time <pb n="319" facs="0364" xml:id="pg_319"/>since the invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia that
                        the Soviet Union has taken direct military action against another country.
                        In the present instance, the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan—a
                        previously non-aligned country—obviously represents an unsettling, dangerous
                        and new stage in your use of military force, which raises deep apprehension
                        about the general trend of Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>We are both pledged to each other not to exacerbate conflict-fraught
                        situations and to consult when threats to the peace arise. If these mutual
                        obligations are to have any meaning, then they must obviously include a
                        refusal by the superpowers to engage in armed combat except as a very last
                        resort and then only in legitimate self-defense. Because our interests are
                        global, we must recognize that actions taken in one area have a spill-over
                        effect in other seemingly unrelated areas, as well as in that area
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>Neither superpower can arrogate to itself the right to displace or overturn a
                        legally constituted government in another country by force of arms. Such a
                        precedent is a dangerous one; it flouts all the accepted norms of
                        international conduct. Unless you draw back from your present course of
                        action, this will inevitably jeopardize the course of US-Soviet relations
                        throughout the world. I urge you to take prompt constructive action to
                        withdraw your forces and cease interference in Afghanistan’s internal
                        affairs. Many years of promoting more stable and productive relations
                        between our two countries could well be undermined if this situation is not
                        resolved promptly. With proper action by your government, it is still not
                        too late to avoid lasting damage to US-Soviet relations.</p>

                    <p>In answer to your message of 29 December I consider it necessary to inform

                        occurring in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. We have already sent
                        through your Ambassador to Moscow in a confidential manner to the American
                        side and to you personally a clarification [an explanation] based on facts
                        of what is actually occurring there, as well as the reasons which caused us
                        to respond favorably to the request of the Government of Afghanistan for the
                        introduction of limited Soviet Military contingents.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">In the left margin at the end of the paragraph,

                    <p>The attempt taken in your message to cast doubt on the very fact of the

                        in Afghanistan has only one goal—to provide assistance in repulsing the acts

                        major watershed in Soviet policy and constituting an unacceptable extension

                        broaden domestic political support for the Democratic Republic of
                        Afghanistan and hoped to facilitate this with the introduction of Soviet
                        combat troops. Any disadvantages of a military move into Afghanistan at this
                        time, <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> asserts, were minimized
                        by the current slump in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet

                        relations with Iran and, to a lesser extent, with Pakistan. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> expresses his hope that a

                            “principal objectives should be to (a) undo the Soviet action to the

                            troops—probably not immediately attainable—and (b) exacting a political
                            price for the Soviet action sufficient to dissuade the Soviets from
                            undertaking other such adventures in the future.” He also outlined a
                            number of possible steps including: unilateral actions such as
                            increasing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military alert status,
                            launching a major propaganda program, bolstering the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military presence in the Persian Gulf
                            and Indian Ocean; multilateral actions such as consultations with

                            action in the Security Council, strengthening security ties with key

                            Afghanistan by breaking or suspending diplomatic recognition. In
                            considering whether to extend recognition, his primary consideration is
                            the illegitimate use of Soviet military force in bringing the Babrak
                            regime into power. Unlike the indigenous Khalqi revolution that occurred
                            in 1978, the present coup resulted only through the blatant intervention
                            of the Soviet military. Additionally, a general <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> practice in deciding on recognition has been whether
                            the government exercises effective control of the country, a dubious
                            proposition with <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s regime
                            and of even greater doubt with the present regime. Finally, though only
                            minimal information is available, Babrak’s press conference gives
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Amstutz</persName> little reason to
                            believe any change has occurred with respect to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests or programs. While no “hasty action” should
                            be taken in order to prevent any precipitous action against mission

                    <p>8680. <gloss target="#t_Subj_1">Subj</gloss>: Sitrep No. 12: Soviet
                        Occupation of Kabul.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. As the second full day of the Soviet occupation of Kabul draws to a close,
                        there is one overwhelming fact evident to all observers here. All meaningful
                        authority in this city is exercised by the Soviet Army, with Afghan
                        participation limited to the traffic police, and a diminishing number of
                        machine-gun toting civilians with white arm bands who apparently are
                        supposed to give the current situation some semblance of legitimacy. We
                        hesitate to risk belaboring this point, but we think it is worth emphasizing
                        that heavily armed Soviet troopers and armored equipment are stationed at
                        every important point throughout the city, they control traffic around the
                        important arteries and crossroads, and they continue to move at will
                        individually and in large units to various destinations. In short, the
                        Afghans do not exercise even a modicum of real control over their own
                        capital.</p>
                    <p>3. Embassy personnel late today observed an almost uninterrupted stream of
                        Soviet armored equipment and troops moving into Kabul from the north over
                        the only paved road heading to the Salang Pass and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. At this point, we are unable to say
                        whether these forces were flown into Bagram Air Base about 25 miles north on
                        the same highway, or whether they came overland all the way from Central
                        Asia. At about 1615 a contingent of twenty-one BMDs, some with towed
                        artillery, and supporting equipment passed the Embassy heading into the
                        center of the city. At 1800, at least twenty BMPs and fifteen BMDs, each
                        with about 6–8 Soviet troopers riding on top, passed the Embassy, also
                        heading in the direction of downtown Kabul. We doubt that these units are
                        ultimately destined for deployment in the city, and presume that they may be
                        on their way to some position on the outskirts to augment the Soviet
                        perimeter now encircling the capital. These movements, however, give some
                        feel for the magnitude of the Soviet Army’s activity today as it apparently
                        reinforces and repositions its forces in order to ensure its grip on
                        Kabul.</p>
                    <p><pb n="327" facs="0372" xml:id="pg_327"/>3. One interesting detail is that
                        Embassy officers have seen certain Soviet units digging in on the perimeter
                        around the city, apparently in an effort to safeguard against any attack
                        from the insurgents or from hostile Afghan Army units. Armored vehicles,
                        including tanks, have been seen in makeshift bunkers. Although it is more
                        likely that the Afghan Army in the field that was fighting for <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> will simply vanish into the
                        hills, rather than take on elite units of the Soviet Army, we cannot rule
                        out the possibility that some army units or individuals may attempt to vent
                        their anti-Russian feelings by kamikaze raids or infiltration into the city
                        in hopes of zapping a few of the “Russian invaders.”</p>
                    <p>4. One wrinkle on the political front is that we have no firm evidence as yet
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> and his colleagues
                        are actually in Kabul trying to forge their new government. Babrak’s
                        recorded statement first heard the night of the Soviet attack continues to
                        be played intermittently, but there has been no other broadcast by him or
                        any other member of the new leadership.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2"><persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s statement was
                            quoted in telegram 332986 to all diplomatic and consular posts, December
                            28. In the statement, carried by Radio Kabul, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> pledged that his government
                            would guarantee “democratic rights of all classes of society and respect
                            the holy faith of Islam and the clergy.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D790595–1188)</note> Under “normal” coup situations, such as April 1978,
                        the new leader usually broadcasts his success as soon as that takeover is
                        apparent. Since Kabul also has a generally functioning TV station, we find
                        it curious that Babrak has not yet trumpeted in person his accession to
                        power.</p>
                    <p>5. On the operational front, Kabul Airport opened to a couple of civilian
                        flights this afternoon, including an Indian Airlines flight and one from
                        Ariana. We have also heard the story, from a reliable source, that the
                        telephone lines, which have been out since the first minutes of the takeover
                        due to satchel charges or grenades planted at Kabul’s <gloss target="#t_PTT_1">PTT</gloss>, may be dead for another month.</p>
                    <p>6. Finally, we note the East German news agency statement reported in <gloss target="#t_FBIS_1">FBIS</gloss> Trends (28 December 79 <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>-Afghanistan) that the Soviet units will
                        be withdrawn “as soon as the causes for this action no longer exist.” Since
                        the Soviet action was taken to impose a different but still Communist regime
                        on Afghanistan, we anticipate that these Soviet military units and their
                        successors may be in Kabul and the rest of Afghanistan for an extended
                        duration.</p>
                    <p>7. A late item is that the Intercontinental Hotel is providing 200 preheated
                        meals to Radio Afghanistan for the “old government and the new government.”
                        This report is sketchy, but it appears that some officials of the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime are being held next door to us,
                        while some <pb n="328" facs="0373" xml:id="pg_328"/>unidentified members of
                        the Babrak government may also be biding their time in the Radio Afghanistan
                        complex.</p>
                    <p>8. This will be the last <gloss target="#t_sitrep_1">sitrep</gloss> for

                    <p><hi rend="italic">SUMMARY</hi> In the current Afghan situation, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has a bear by the tail. It became
                        entangled in an opportunistic and ideologically attractive grab to take
                        advantage of the probably fortuitous emergence of a Marxist regime in Kabul
                        in the revolutionary coup of April 1978. It cannot now let go without
                        suffering damage to its image as a Marxist superpower that poses as a
                        reliable ally of socialist and would-be socialist regimes. It also wants to
                        avoid the risk that a hostile state will appear on yet another—and
                        sensitive—stretch of the Soviet frontier. Yet, as it holds on, it becomes
                        ever more deeply enmeshed in an Afghan civil war, which pits a highly
                        unpopular, fractious, and factionalized minority grouping of leftists
                        against the great rural tribal majority, who hate all that the leftists
                        stand for.</p>
                    <p>Given this unattractive prospect, Moscow has now begun to escalate its
                        intervention in Afghan affairs in the hope that this will improve its
                        chances to reduce the just mentioned negative aspects of the situation. It
                        is trying to insure that it will gain reliable control over its client
                        regime (which it did not have under <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>) and that Afghanistan will neither sink into anarchy
                        (thus increasing the risk of external intervention) nor become a hostile
                        neighbor to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Moscow is <pb n="329" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_329"/>willing to pay the international
                        costs for its actions, but it probably calculates that its losses will be
                        short-lived. Besides, it may assume that eventual success will bring
                        exploitable dividends in the form of a more respected image as a decisive
                        and powerful actor on the world scene.</p>
                    <p>To reduce the insurgency, as a follow-up to their drastic moves of this week,
                        the Soviet leadership will heighten military pressures against the
                        insurgents, including some Soviet combat involvement. Thus far, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has brought to bear in Afghanistan a
                        large airborne force, sizable numbers of additional fighter aircraft,
                        helicopters, military air transport, and two motorized rifle divisions.
                        Several other ground force divisions are being readied at least as a backup
                        reserve. These deployed forces can assure the security of Kabul, of the
                        three other largest cities, of several strategically located towns, of roads
                        near the Soviet frontier, and of the land lines of communication from the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to Kabul and Herat. If the
                        Soviets were to plan general and large-scale combat actions of their own
                        against insurgent positions throughout Afghanistan, they would need ten to
                        fifteen divisions and major logistical bases. Up to now, we can see nothing
                        initiated in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> on that scale.</p>
                    <p>Accompanying the military moves, it must be expected that Moscow will now
                        start experimenting with new political approaches to lure a respectable
                        proportion of the dissidents away from the insurgent camp. However, we judge
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>’s chances of
                        gaining substantial popular support are as poor as <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s. His words are meant to sound promising to
                        disaffected Afghans, but his predecessors used almost identical language
                        without result. Tribal groups detest the Marxist trappings of the regime,
                        which seems doomed to a very narrow base of followers—and these almost
                        exclusively in urban areas. Political gains for Babrak would require major
                        political concessions and a reduction of the Soviet presence, but neither he
                        nor the Soviets can afford to go far enough to satisfy the opposition.</p>
                    <p>We do not yet know how the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> plans to
                        use the Afghan army in the future. For one thing, the army’s loyalty to the
                        new regime is highly suspect. For another, it is demoralized and
                        understrength, while its recruitment prospects are poor. Still, if it
                        manages now to hold together as a viable institution after Babrak’s further
                        purges, Soviet intervention, together with new training and equipment, could
                        help to rebuild it to a point where, in the spring, it may be able to score
                        some initial successes against the insurgents, provided that there were some
                        Soviet combat involvement alongside.</p>
                    <p>Regional reaction to the Soviet intervention will be overwhelmingly
                        disapproving. Iran will be very alarmed, but it will remain wrapped up in
                        its own troubles, and will not be distracted from continuing to give
                        priority attention to its confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Pakistan will <pb n="330" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_330"/>now
                        feel very exposed to Soviet pressures and will urge America and China to
                        give it political and military support, lest it be obliged to kowtow to the
                        Soviet Union. India will also be negative, but its policy reaction will
                        depend on how the repercussions play themselves out around Pakistan. China
                        will denounce the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> once again and be
                        ready for closer cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        The Arab states of the Persian Gulf will show great anxiety at what they
                        interpret as further evidence of a Soviet expansionist plan that envisages
                        Moscow’s eventual control over them. Iraq’s strong opposition to the Soviet
                        action will lead it to try to bring about greater mutual security
                        coordination among the Gulf Arab states, but without reliance on Washington.

                    <p>1. 29 December 1979, the leader of the Hezbe-i-Islami Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss>) <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Gulbuddin
                            Hekmatyar</persName>, was making every effort to make known the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss>’s opposition to the Soviet-backed government
                        of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> and to emphasize
                        that there are no changes in their policy of armed opposition to the new
                        regime in Kabul. (Source comment: Other Peshawar based Afghan exile groups
                        also appear to be following suit and the general feeling among exile leaders
                        is that “Babrak is more cruel than <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>.”) To reinforce their determination, the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> clandestine radio station operated the
                        entire day of 29 December broadcasting in <pb n="331" facs="0376" xml:id="pg_331"/>Dari, Pushtu and Baluchi languages condemning the
                        Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and calling for the overthrow of the
                        Babrak regime.</p>
                    <p>2. According to reports reaching <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss>
                        headquarters in Peshawar, by the evening of 28 December, there has been
                        little military action in the southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan
                        except for a report that a large convoy of tanks and armored vehicles was
                        sighted heading from Kabul towards Jalalabad. (Source comment: The
                        information on the convoy was imprecise and could not be confirmed.) In the
                        countryside the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> describes the situation
                        among the general populace as restive with anti-Soviet sentiment increasing
                        to a new high.</p>
                    <p>3. On 30 December, <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> leader <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</persName> along with a member of
                        the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss>’s political committee traveled from
                        Peshawar to Islamabad where they intended to deliver communiqués to various
                        foreign missions asking these governments to withhold diplomatic recognition
                        of the Babrak regime and to ask for immediate material support.<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hekmatyar</persName> met

                            Islamabad. No record of this meeting was found.</note> (Source comment:
                        It is not known which missions will receive the communiqué nor how long
                        Gulbuddin will stay in Islamabad; however, it is possible that he might be
                        seeking meetings with Government of Pakistan (<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>) officials in addition to delivering the communiqués. It is
                        the hope of the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> will make a realistic appraisal of the
                        Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and will rally to the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> with immediate material support.) There is
                        definite concern within the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> leadership
                        that as soon as it is practical for them to do so, Soviet ground troops will
                        be introduced into the fighting on a large scale and they are concerned
                        about their ability to defend against massive Soviet military action.
                        However, at the present time the <gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss> plans to
                        keep their mujahiddin in the field and to defend the “liberated areas”

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>The Soviet-installed government of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> is dominated by members of his Parcham faction
                        of the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan, but leftist military
                        officers who overthrew President Daoud in April 1978 and installed the first
                            <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> government are also important
                        participants. Many of the Cabinet members and the Parchamists who are
                        helping with security in Kabul have been hiding in the Soviet Embassy in
                        Afghanistan for up to a year. Included in this category are Sherjan
                        Mazduryar, Minister of Transport, and Revolutionary Council member <persName corresp="#p_WMA_1">Mohammad Aslam Watanjar</persName>, who reportedly
                        fled to the Soviet Embassy after the mid-September coup in which <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> deposed <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and
                            handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>There are also several men in the Cabinet who have not been closely tied to
                        either Parcham or the military leftists in the past, and a few who seem to
                        have been closer to the party’s Khalq faction—headed by the late Presidents
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>—than to Parcham. Almost all, however,
                        seem to have had a good reason to hate <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and to have cooperated in his overthrow. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>So far the Babrak government has announced a partial list of the Cabinet and
                        some members of the Revolutionary Council (in theory a supervisory,
                        quasi-legislative body) and publicly designated three individuals as “party
                        members,” a term possibly intended to recognize their importance without
                        granting them any authority. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                            on December 31, as reported in telegram 8730. The note read: “The

                            1358 (December 27, 1979), the usurping and tyrannical regime of

                            a result of corruption and anti-Khalq actions. In this sensitive moment,
                            comprehending its grave national and historic responsibility, the

                            over the ruling power of government and appointed <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> as the General Secretary

                    <p>Elaborating on this theme, the article states that the regime in Kabul was
                        threatened by insurgents based in Pakistan who have received “unlimited
                        backing” from the US and China. It even claims that Egyptian “specialists”
                        have joined Chinese and American instructors in training the insurgents.</p>
                    <p>US involvement with the insurgents, the article alleges, reflects the efforts
                        of “figures in Washington” to shore up a “strategic arc” in the region,
                        which was “cracked” by the Shah’s ouster.</p>

                        <item>Soviet Policy in Afghanistan (U)</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>There is an increasing tendency in the news media and around town generally
                        to make an analogy between Afghanistan and Vietnam. In my view, this is
                        simplistic and dangerous. While the situations do share some similar
                        characteristics—the danger of a protracted involvement, for instance—there
                        are important differences:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">logistics and transport:</hi> The US had to transport
                        troops and materiel over 5000 miles; the Soviets can move troops and
                        materiel quickly over short distances and across open borders.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">organization:</hi> The North Vietnamese had been fighting
                        the war for 25 years before the US became heavily involved. They had a well
                        organized, well disciplined army and underground; the Afghan tribes have a
                        history of insurgency, but they are not well organized and many of their
                        actions are uncoordinated—or at least have been until now.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">leadership:</hi> The North Vietnamese were led by a leader
                        who was generally regarded as a national hero, even in the South; at present
                        no such national leader has emerged in Afghanistan who can rally the
                        disparate tribes and provide cohesive, inspirational leadership.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">weapons and supplies:</hi> The North Vietnamese could
                        count on outside aid and weapons in large quantities; this is not (yet) the
                        case in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">political constraints:</hi> US was constrained by (1)
                        disunity over its goals; (2) its unwillingness to commit the forces needed
                        to “win” the war militarily; (3) a desire to accommodate its South
                        Vietnamese ally. The Soviet Union is under no such constraints. Having
                        overthrown <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and installed their
                        own puppet, who is completely beholden to them, the Soviets are likely to
                        commit the resources needed to neutralize, if not defeat the insurgents,
                        rapidly and in large number.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">role of the media:</hi> Vietnam was a “media event” and
                        this had a major impact on US domestic and international opinion, turning
                        much of it against the war and US involvement. This will not be the case in
                            <pb n="337" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_337"/>Afghanistan. The Soviets will
                        restrict access to the war by the press, and there will be few film clips of
                        Soviet soldiers setting fire to Afghan huts or mopping up Moslem villages
                        being flashed across TV screens into Soviet living rooms—or for that matter
                        across TV screens anywhere. This will minimize Soviet domestic and
                        international criticism, after the initial furor dies down. (C)</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, the Soviets will not have an easy time in Afghanistan. While
                        Moscow will probably attempt to broaden the support for the new government,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> is not likely to prove to
                        be any more popular than <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was;
                        indeed in the eyes of many Afghans he may be regarded as worse, since he is
                        clearly a creature of the Soviets. Moreover, the Soviets</p>
                    <p>—will face a hostile climate and terrain, which will make wiping out the
                        insurgents difficult;</p>
                    <p>—have difficulty transporting supplies <hi rend="italic">once inside</hi> the
                        country; this too will hamper their efforts;</p>
                    <p>—lack experience in guerrilla warfare;</p>
                    <p>—will probably need to “Sovietize” the war because the regular Afghan army is
                        in no shape to defeat the guerrillas. (C)</p>
                    <p>The basic point is that, while the Soviets confront significant problems in
                        Afghanistan and the prospect of deepening involvement, they are not likely
                        to face many of the constraints that the US faced in Vietnam. They can be
                        expected to move <hi rend="italic">rapidly and in force</hi> to carry out
                        their goals, with little of the vacillation characterized by US efforts in
                        Southeast Asia. This will be a critical advantage. Whether it will be enough
                        remains to be seen and will depend to a large extent on</p>
                    <p>—the ability of the Afghan insurgents to coordinate their activities;</p>
                    <p>—our ability to work effectively with Pakistan and other countries to aid the
                        insurgents;</p>
                    <p>—our ability to keep up public awareness of Soviet actions and to mobilize
                        pressure against them within the Nonaligned and Moslem world. (C)</p>

                                Document 111</ref>) and told <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> that, in light of the Soviet intervention,

                            that put us in position of offering substantial assistance so that we

                        restate the situation as follows: (C)</p>
                    <p>1. Whether we like it or not, the Paks do not see the situation as we do.
                        They think that they are doing us a favor in helping with covert action or
                        criticizing the Soviets about Afghanistan. In their view, we are conducting
                        superpower rivalry and they don’t think that we really care about them.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>2. Certainly up until now, the only way that we could get them mobilized in
                        directions that we think are important has been by providing military
                        equipment and (probably) security guarantees at a level far beyond anything
                        that I think is feasible here. That is why I had hoped the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> would look very hard at what would be
                        involved. It didn’t, and neither, apparently, did the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. What <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> offered—<pb n="339" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_339"/>and
                        what we are still thinking about—is simply inadequate to motivate the
                            Paks.<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">An apparent reference to <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s suggestion to increase <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>–480 aid to Pakistan, which he made
                            during the National Security Council meeting on December 28. See <ref target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note> (S)</p>
                    <p>3. It is barely possible that the implications of the new situation may sink
                        in and the Paks will start changing their attitudes. But I don’t think it is
                        likely. (S)</p>
                    <p>4. There may be some possibility of getting better results by dealing
                        directly with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. This, however, is
                        very hard to do. Even when the President called him, he equivocated until he
                        could consult with his advisers. That means <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName> who, I believe, has permanently written the US off. He
                        will undermine at every step whatever we hope to accomplish with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. (S)</p>
                    <p>5. The main implication of all of this is that our chances of getting
                        Pakistani cooperation in a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> program are
                        really quite poor. This has major implications for our objectives vis-a-vis
                        the Soviets in Afghanistan, for there is no present alternative to
                        cooperation with Pakistan. Obviously a prime Soviet objective will be to cut
                        off support coming to the rebels from Pakistan. Here, again, if we have any
                        chance, it is through a strong private message from the President to
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. (S)</p>
                    <p>6. The only way of getting to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        directly and forcing him to give his own answers is probably by a visit
                        here. Even then, however, the odds are against us. On foreign policy matters
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> seems to rely on <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> completely. And that is going to lead
                        him to an accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>7. That off-chance would be the one positive value of the visit. Aside from
                        that, I wish the invitation had not been tendered. It is not good for us to
                        be identified too much with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, who
                        is in bad trouble politically at home. We may think that we are simply
                        showing our support for Pakistan. In Pakistan, however, it will be
                        interpreted as support for the unpopular <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. Thus, on balance, I hope that we don’t push this
                        question of a visit. The ball is in his court, let it stay there. (S)</p>

                    <p>2. Begin summary. This report, which elaborates the initial thoughts on the
                        Soviet move into Afghanistan which we reported in more restricted channels,
                        attempts to analyze both the immediate objectives and the possible
                        longer-range purposes behind the action.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">Likely
                            reference is to telegram 28119 from Moscow, December 28, which is
                            printed in <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d247"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. VI, Soviet Union, Document

                        The obvious immediate aim was to replace <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> with a ruler who might stand a better chance of gaining
                        popular support for the Marxist regime, thus bringing the insurgency to an
                        end. But this objective would not, in our view, in and of itself have
                        justified the Soviet move, given the seeming risk to other Soviet foreign
                        policy interests. We assume, then, that other factors also heavily
                        influenced the decision. Among these, in descending order of probability,
                        would be:</p>
                    <p>—fear that hatred of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and growing
                        insurgency might eventually produce the collapse of the Marxist regime—a
                        development to be prevented at whatever cost because of its potential impact
                        on Eastern Europe;</p>
                    <p>—similarly, a concern that defeat of the regime by forces of Islamic
                        fundamentalism, which if combined with similar forces in Iran and Pakistan
                        would have potentially dangerous implications for the Soviet Union’s own
                        Moslem population;</p>
                    <p>—a desire to construct a “cordon sanitaire” around China—based on Soviet
                        control over Mongolia, Indochina, and Afghanistan and continuing good
                        relations with India; and</p>
                    <p>—at a later point in time, the beginning of a drive toward the Indian Ocean
                        through Pakistan, or possibly toward the Persian Gulf through the Baluchi
                        area of Iran.</p>
                    <p><pb n="341" facs="0386" xml:id="pg_341"/>We find no credible evidence of a
                        split within the Soviet leadership on the decision to move into Afghanistan.
                        They must have agreed that many outside factors combined to make the time
                        propitious for the move: increasing doubt about the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty, the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> theater nuclear force decision, the crisis in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian relations, and the termination of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military aid to Pakistan, among
                        others. While we are not prepared to conclude that the Afghan decision
                        represents a permanent turning away from the policy of détente, we believe
                        that, given the present slump in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet
                        relations, the Soviets concluded that no real progress was to be expected in
                        any case in the months ahead. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. There is much which argued against the Soviet armed intervention into
                        Afghanistan. The move seems likely to worsen Moscow’s relations with
                        Pakistan, Iran, and other Muslim states, not to mention China. It will
                        seriously strain the very fabric of the policies of détente with the West
                        and especially with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, jeopardizing
                        in the process the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty. There is
                        even the danger of becoming bogged down in an Indochina-type guerilla war
                        (though we recognize that parallels with Vietnam are very imperfect).</p>
                    <p>4. Why, then, did they do it, when the potential damage to Soviet foreign
                        policy interests was so great? We do not pretend to have the answer, other
                        than to make the perhaps obvious observation that the Soviets must have
                        considered all these risks and concluded that the potential benefits
                        outweighed them.</p>
                    <p>Soviet objectives</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviets apparently have multiple objectives. The most immediate one
                        would be related to the situation within Afghanistan itself, with Moscow
                        moving to remove <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and carry out
                        its long-held plans for broadening the regime’s base, installing a leader
                        who can gain more popular support for the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> in hopes of quelling the insurgency. Their massive troop
                        support suggests that they are prepared to launch a major offensive
                        themselves against the insurgents if Babrak is unable to gain that needed
                        support from the population.</p>
                    <p>6. Beyond the immediate situation, however, we would imagine several
                        ideological and geopolitical considerations which entered into the decision.
                        While some of them are in the worst-case category, they are perhaps worth
                        mentioning as an aid to analysis:</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s lack of popular support and
                        inability to come to terms with the Muslim insurgency risked the eventual
                        fall of a Marxist-oriented government from power. Once installed in an area
                        contiguous to the Soviet Union, no “Socialist” regime has fallen from power
                        in recent times; the Soviets may have determined not to allow Afghanistan to
                        become the exception, fearing the impact of such an “ideological” <pb n="342" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_342"/>defeat on the nationalist
                        aspirations of the other Communist countries in the Socialist Bloc.</p>
                    <p>—Potentially more dangerous than a simple defeat of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> would have been its defeat by forces of
                        Islamic fundamentalism, which pose a threat to the Soviets not only in
                        ideological terms but also in geopolitical terms. The outcome of the present
                        turmoil in Iran is far from clear, and despite the loss of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> influence in that country the present
                        trends are not necessarily favorable for the Soviet Union. The move into
                        Afghanistan could have been intended to forestall similar chaos there. A
                        prevailing tide of Muslim fundamentalism on the Soviet Union’s southern
                        borders could well be perceived by the Soviet leadership as providing the
                        catalyst for arousing at some future time nationalistic aspirations in the
                        six Soviet Central Asian republics with their population of some 50 million
                        Muslims.</p>
                    <p>—The China factor must also be considered, given Soviet paranoia about the
                        long-term threat from China. It seems to us that Chinese fears of a Soviet
                        encirclement strategy are overdrawn, yet the concurrent strengthening of
                        Moscow’s position in Indochina with the fresh move into Afghanistan will no
                        doubt strengthen Chinese concerns. Taken together with the existing Soviet
                        military presence in Mongolia and the continued wooing of India, the makings
                        of a “cordon sanitaire” around China are present. We would see the Afghan
                        move, if it is directed against China, as basically defensive, but we cannot
                        exclude the possibility that the Afghan operation is a dry run for an
                        eventual move into Sinkiang. At the moment, however, we would place this as
                        very low on the scale of probabilities.</p>
                    <p>—A key question is whether the Soviet action will be self-contained in
                        Afghanistan, or whether there are broader objectives. There may be only a
                        plan to help the Afghanis seal off the border with Pakistan, to prevent use
                        of <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> territory by rebel reinforcements.
                        But some Pakistani officials have long feared the revival of historic
                        Russian ambitions to move toward the Arabian Sea through Afghanistan and
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>—The turmoil in Iran, as well as the crisis in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian relations might even tempt the Soviets to move
                        through Afghanistan and Iranian Baluchistan to the Straits of Hormuz, thus
                        establishing a controlling position on access to the Persian Gulf and
                        Iranian oil. Should Iran begin to disintegrate into autonomous regions, a
                        Soviet move into the Kurdish areas, thereby extending Soviet Azerbaijan,
                        might also be tempting. Again, we consider such moves improbable in the near
                        term, but we are unable to dismiss the possibility altogether.</p>
                    <p>Timing, decision-making and the leadership factor</p>
                    <p>7. We assume that the Soviet leadership, in preparing the Afghan operation,
                        considered the overall shape of their foreign relations. We assume further
                        that, while contingency plans may have existed earlier, <pb n="343" facs="0388" xml:id="pg_343"/>planning for the operation began in earnest
                        about a month before it was carried out—i.e., during the latter part of
                        November. At that time, the Soviets may have perceived:</p>
                    <p>—That <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was at death’s door
                        anyway.</p>
                    <p>—That prospects for obtaining <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> treatment
                        from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the near future were
                        non-existent.</p>
                    <p>—That <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> was not going to heed Soviet
                        warnings about the dangers of the impending decision on long-range theater
                        nuclear forces.</p>
                    <p>—That the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> administration was committed
                        to a defense build-up, whether or not <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        was ratified.</p>
                    <p>—That the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was actively expanding its
                        military presence in the region and, if it succeeded in obtaining basing for

                    <p>—That the present slump in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet
                        relations would last at least until after <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> elections, with or without Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—That the just-ended first round of Sino-Soviet negotiations showed that
                        relations with China were no better, but also no worse.</p>
                    <p>—That the crisis in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian relations
                        would tend to minimize the impact of Iran’s negative reaction and, at a
                        minimum, prevent Iran from turning to closer relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in reaction to the move into
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—That the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cut-off of military aid to
                        Pakistan would leave Pakistan little alternative but to accommodate to the
                        Soviet move.</p>
                    <p>—That the weakness of India’s caretaker government would minimize the
                        likelihood of a sharp shift in Indian foreign policy as a result of the
                        Soviet move, while the good prospects for Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName>’s return to power give the Soviets hope for continued
                        good relations with India over the longer run.</p>
                    <p>8. In sum, the world scene as viewed from the Kremlin offered no overriding
                        deterrent to moving now. Action would stave off future dangers, and
                        circumstances combined to minimize the losses. Yet taking this major step
                        still would have been a hard-fought decision, and it is tempting to
                        speculate that one or another constellation of leaders in the Politburo
                        gained the upper hand and decided to move on their own. There is, in fact,
                        speculation in Moscow that runs along the lines that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> would not have concurred had he
                        been in the thick of <pb n="344" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_344"/>decision-making in recent weeks, given his presumed concern with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>9. We have no credible evidence, however, that this was not a collective
                        decision wholeheartedly adopted by the entire Politburo. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has been active at least
                        on-and-off of late, and so far as we know the ailing <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> is the only member of the top
                        leadership who would have been unable to take part in planning for the
                        Afghan operation.</p>
                    <p>10. If our theory is correct, then along with the Afghan decision the
                        leadership must also have taken some basic decisions on such matters as
                        détente and the shape of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet
                        relations in the immediate future. While we are not prepared as yet to
                        conclude that this represents a permanent Soviet turn away from the policy
                        of détente, it rather plainly suggests that Moscow does not expect any real
                        progress in relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the
                        months ahead.</p>

                            Karmal</persName> as President of Afghanistan, will not significantly
                        alter the prospects for prolonged insurgency. Despite increased Soviet aid,
                        the new regime will be a government under siege, continually attacked by
                        fiercely independent, but poorly organized, Pashtun tribesmen. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Communist regime in Afghanistan and the Afghan tribesmen have been in
                        conflict since the Communist seizure of power in 1978. Although the
                        tribesmen are not unified, they will continue to keep the countryside in a
                        state of instability. The regime, despite only a thin layer of public
                        support, probably will maintain control of the major cities. Indeed, the
                        Soviets and their puppet regime are likely to face the same long resistance
                        that an earlier generation experienced when the Soviets required a decade to
                        subdue the Muslim populations of Central Asia. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>For thousands of years, the topography and Afghan cultural mores militated
                        against the formation of a strong central government and even against a
                        strong union of the tribes themselves. The only characteristics common to
                        the tribesmen are martial values, an egalitarian tradition, a theologically
                        unsophisticated version of Islam, and a distrust for authority. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Successful Afghan monarchs mustered popular support by drawing upon the
                        people’s fears of invasion by a foreign power with an alien religion and
                        bent tradition to their side through the skillful exploitation of such
                        traditional values as defense of personal and tribal honor, attachment to
                        religion, and intense dislike of foreigners. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In contrast, the Communist revolutionaries have tried to overturn tradition
                        rather than adapt it, to eliminate local autonomy, to destroy the elite
                        class by confiscating its land, and to undermine the authority of the Muslim
                        religious establishment. These actions have aroused the resistance of the
                        fiercely independent Afghans. The present no-win situation—persistent
                        insurgency and fragile Communist control of urban areas—is expected to
                        continue. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>The Soviet-supported coup in Afghanistan has further damaged the already
                        badly strained relations between Tehran and Kabul. After a two-month hiatus,
                        Iran has resumed its propaganda attacks on the Kabul government, which it
                        sees as a puppet of the Soviets and an anti-Islamic force in the region.
                        Soviet efforts to allay Iranian concern about the coup apparently have
                        failed; the Iranians have formally condemned the Soviet military
                            intervention.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">On December 29, the Iranian

                            Muslims of the world.” (Doyle McManus, “Iran Protests, Tells Soviets to

                    <p>The secular leadership of the Iranian Government is unlikely in the near term
                        to shift from its policy of not supporting the Afghan insurgents. Over time,
                        however, it will be pressed to give more support to the insurgents by Iran’s
                        religious leadership. The religious leadership is already providing some
                        training and arms support for the rebels, and this is likely to increase.

                    <p>The Soviet-inspired coup and the Soviet military intervention will increase
                        Iran’s concern about Soviet activities and intentions in Iran. Tehran will

                    <p>As former Afghanistan Ambassador to the United States for more than a decade,
                        I have been troubled a great deal as have the rest of the world over the
                        recent invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">An unknown hand underlined the first portion of this

                        Mr. President, but as an Afghan, I can assure you sir that only strong
                        retaliatory measures could have any significant effect in stopping further
                        Soviet aggression in that vulnerable region of the world.</p>
                    <p>If the United States does not act decisively and immediately, there is almost
                        nothing to prevent the Russians from advancing into Iran, Pakistan, India
                        and ultimately the Persian Gulf. I, therefore, Mr. President humbly urge you
                        to take the necessary strong action needed to <pb n="348" facs="0393" xml:id="pg_348"/>force a Soviet withdrawal and a return of independence,
                        neutrality and integrity to Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>And if I may also suggest to you sir, it would be altogether proper to form a
                        task force consisting of former prominent Afghan officials now residing in
                        the United States as well as private American citizens who are well
                        acquainted with Afghanistan to assist you in evaluating the current events
                        in Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">No record of a task force, per

                            found.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I, for one, find it very difficult to idly sit by and not be
                        able to contribute to my country’s cause. It is also unimaginable for me to
                        see Afghanistan become another part of the Soviet block. It is this very
                        fear of loss of identity that has forced hundreds of thousands of Afghans to
                        seek refuge in neighboring Pakistan, there to regroup and organize a counter
                        force against the communist regime in their homeland. But now their hopes of
                        success against direct Russian army have diminished, unless they receive
                        substantial assistance and support from the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, my prayers are with you and for the quick release of the
                        American hostages in Iran.</p>

                    <p>As you consider options regarding the situation in Southwest Asia, I would
                        like to recall for you an earlier crisis which in my judgment has some
                        striking parallels with the present challenge we face in Afghanistan, in
                        that region and globally. I have in mind the events which led up to the
                        promulgation of the <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> Doctrine,
                        announced by <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> in his message
                        to Congress on March 12, 1947.<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">For the text of
                                <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>’s address to

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>’s message responded to what he
                        perceived to be a clear and present danger. It was the threatened collapse
                        under Soviet pressure of two countries which at the time were at the outer
                        limits of American consciousness—Greece and Turkey. Communist governments
                        had been established with the aid of Soviet troops throughout the Balkans.
                        Greece was in the midst of a civil war, instigated in the main by
                        communist-led insurgents. Concurrently, Moscow was putting pressure on
                        Ankara to revise the Montreaux Convention to prevent access of non-Black Sea
                        powers into the Black Sea, and had raised claims of sovereignty against two
                        areas in Turkey. (C)</p>
                    <p>All this in a region which prior to 1947 had been a British sphere of
                        influence of little or no strategic interest to the United States. Within
                        this country there was strong sentiment for a rapid <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> disengagement from all of Europe and a return to
                        isolationism. <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> was also under
                        considerable pressure from a number of politicians, especially Henry
                        Wallace, who argued that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should
                        undertake more strenuous efforts to cooperate with Moscow. (C)</p>
                    <p>Against this background, the United States received an urgent message in late
                        February 1947 that the British intended to cease aid to Greece and Turkey
                        within six weeks.<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">See <ref target="frus1947v05#d24"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi>

                        was not simply the question of aiding Greece and Turkey, although that was a
                        startling enough idea at the time. They also were among the first in the
                        post World War II period to recognize the importance of buttressing regional
                        security and sending Moscow an unmistakable signal that the United States
                        was determined to protect not only old vital interests but new ones as well,
                        and to resist Soviet pressure. (U)</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>’s message was a turning point
                        in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy. Specifically he:</p>
                    <p>—announced that it was the policy of the United States to support free
                        peoples who were resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by
                        outside pressures;</p>
                    <p>—requested Congress to provide authority for assistance to Greece and Turkey
                        in the amount of $400 million;</p>
                    <p>—asked Congress to authorize the detail of American civilian and military
                        personnel to Greece and Turkey to assist in the task of reconstruction and
                        to help supervise the use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> financial
                        and material support;</p>
                    <p>—asked Congress for authority to provide for the instruction and training of
                        select Greek and Turkish personnel; and</p>
                    <p>—asked Congress to provide authority to permit the rapid and effective use in
                        terms of needed commodities, supplies and equipment, of any funds that they
                        authorized. (U)</p>

                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>This speech marked the beginning of one of the most creative periods of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomacy. Most importantly, it
                        signalled the intention of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to
                        abandon its past hesitancy and to assume a more activist role
                        internationally. Without this rapid and resolute action on our part, the
                        Soviet Union would have continued to increase its pressure on Turkey and in
                        Greece, and the evolution of Southern Europe and the Middle East would
                        undoubtedly have been quite different. (U)</p>
                    <p>Today we face a Soviet challenge in an area of the world which is only a
                        little more unfamiliar to most Americans than were Greece and Turkey in
                        1947. As in 1947, the West looks to us because only we can provide the
                        necessary leadership and resources to turn back the Soviet threat to our
                        interests in the region and beyond. As in 1947, a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> public formerly weary of war and international
                        responsibility is increasingly ready to respond to a call for a more active
                        American role in the world to protect our vital interests, as the President
                        defines them. There are, however, two sharp differences between the present
                        Soviet challenge <pb n="351" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_351"/>in South Asia and
                        the threat in 1947. The Soviet intervention in the present case is both more
                        blatant and more brutal than in 1947, and the Gulf is unquestionably more
                        vital to Western interests today than were Greece and Turkey 30 years ago.

                    <p>1. Our ultimate goal is the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
                        Even if this is not attainable, we should make Soviet involvement as costly
                        as possible and should use the events in Afghanistan as a rallying point for

                        necessary. It would be preferable, however, for other countries to take the
                        lead in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. Messages should be sent to our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        Allies, China and key leaders in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                        Non-Aligned Movement, drawing their attention to the events in Afghanistan
                        and calling for appropriate responses.</p>
                    <p>4. We will not link the Soviet action in Afghanistan to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. At the same time, however, we will not
                        permit our interest in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> to deter us
                        from speaking and acting forcefully.</p>
                    <p>5. We will send public and private messages to the Soviets, citing the
                        unacceptability of their behavior, the threat to the peace posed by <pb n="352" facs="0397" xml:id="pg_352"/>their actions, and their violation
                        of the principles of behavior we agreed to in 1972. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>

                    <p>1. We are prepared to send a high-level mission to Pakistan, headed by Deputy

                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>4. Two GEARING-class destroyers will be provided to Pakistan
                        expeditiously.</p>
                    <p>5. We shall move promptly in providing $40 million in PL–480 assistance.</p>
                    <p>6. Additional assistance will be provided to help Pakistan deal with the
                        Afghan refugee problem.</p>
                    <p>7. We will reaffirm our nuclear policy towards Pakistan and make clear the
                        legislative restrictions. We will, however, urge the Pakistanis to put the
                        problem aside for solution later while we deal with the Soviet-Afghan
                        problem. (S)</p>

                            The motorized rifle division at Kizyl-Arvat that began vacating its

                            shops in Qandahar and demonstrated against the government. The Afghan
                            commander there used tanks to disperse the crowds.</hi></p>

                            Army has continued throughout the country, with the rebels exerting
                            heavy pressure on government forces in the northeast and initiating new
                            fighting in the southwest. Soviet forces may have conducted some
                            clearing operations north of Kabul on Monday, but contact between the
                            Soviets and the rebels has apparently been limited.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign commentary</p>
                    <p>The new Afghan Government has been trying to justify the Soviet intervention
                        by echoing Moscow’s charges of US interference in Afghan internal
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>Moscow, for its part, has been saying that US offers of military assistance
                        to Pakistan demonstrate Washington’s intention to continue supporting Afghan
                        insurgents, but it has issued no additional authoritative statements.</p>
                    <p>Conservative Persian Gulf states, with Saudi Arabia in the lead, have issued
                        strong condemnations of the Soviet action. Several states have underscored
                        their sympathy for the Afghan insurgents as fellow Muslims.</p>
                    <p>Although Iraq has not issued any formal response, Baghdad is clearly uneasy
                        over the latest Soviet use of force. <hi rend="italic">One senior Baath
                            official compared the Soviet action to US involvement in Vietnam and
                            said that ultimately Afghan resistance would lead the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to withdraw.</hi> Baghdad’s
                        reaction, however, is likely to be colored by its deep suspicion of US
                        intentions in the region and its preoccupation with its deteriorating
                        relations with Iran.</p>
                    <p>Reactions elsewhere in the Middle East have been along generally predictable
                        lines. Syria, Lebanon, and the PLO have not commented, while Egypt and other
                        moderate states have denounced the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>China on 30 December issued a government statement—used only infrequently by
                        Beijing—that called the Soviet action a threat to “peace and security in
                        Asia and throughout the world,” and a Vice Foreign Minister told the Soviet
                        Ambassador that the intervention posed “a <pb n="355" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_355"/>threat to China’s security.”<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">The full text of the Chinese statement was relayed in

                    <p>India’s acting Prime Minister has expressed “deep concern” about the
                        situation in Kabul but has also voiced “grave concern” over possible new US

                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> reported that about 40,000 Soviet troops
                        are now in Afghanistan. They are encountering some resistance. The Afghan
                        army is shrinking rapidly through desertions. The rebel tribes will retreat
                        in the mountains and continue resistance, probably increasing in the spring.
                        Thus, the insurgency will continue, and Soviet forces will be the main
                        source of the counterinsurgency effort. (S)</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> also reported that Egypt is sending
                        equipment to Pakistan to be supplied to the Afghanistan insurgents, and
                        Saudi Arabia has agreed to contribute $4 million. (S)</p>
                    <p>It was asserted in the discussion that the degree of resistance in
                        Afghanistan will depend upon two factors: first, the size of the support
                        received covertly through Pakistan, and second, the degree of Soviet
                        pressure on Pakistan to block this supply. (S)</p>

                        It was argued that the small support we can now promise Pakistan will be
                        more confusing than reassuring because of the publicity about changing

                        to address the non-proliferation issue with the Congress and find a

                    <p>While there are obvious differences between the Soviet intervention in
                        Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in assessing
                        the risks the Soviets were probably influenced at least in part by their
                        experience in Czechoslovakia, particularly world reaction. It may be useful,
                        therefore, to briefly review developments in the post-invasion period for
                        insights into Soviet attitudes and possible diplomatic moves in the
                            future.<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">For documentation on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response to the Soviet intervention in

                        (C)</p>
                    <p>In my view there are several aspects of the post-invasion period which are
                        important in the present context:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The sobering impact on Eastern Europe</hi>. The invasion
                        not only halted the deterioration of the situation in Czechoslovakia but had
                        a sobering impact on all of East Europe. This was particularly true of
                        Romania and Yugoslavia. While they condemned the invasion, they also were
                        more cautious for several years thereafter in undertaking initiatives <pb n="358" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_358"/>that might irritate the Soviets and
                        showed a distinct interest in fostering a <hi rend="italic">limited</hi>
                        improvement of relations with Moscow. The Soviets probably calculated that
                        the invasion of Afghanistan would have an analogous effect, not just in
                        Eastern Europe but in some other countries bordering on Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The rapid dissipation of public indignation in the
                            West</hi>. While most countries reacted with shock to the invasion, it
                        proved difficult to maintain public indignation over a sustained period of
                        time. “Normalization” and the retention of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia
                        soon became a fact of life, and a year after the invasion the West was
                        actively engaged in detente diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Moscow’s continued interest in detente with the
                            West</hi>. Contrary to the expectations of many, the invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia did not sound the death knell of detente, but proved to be,
                        as Michel Debrey accurately predicted at the time, only “a detour on the
                        road to detente.”<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Michel Debré was Prime
                            Minister of France from 1959 until 1962. The source of this quote was
                            not found.</note> In fact, one of the most striking features of the
                        post-invasion period is how quickly Moscow moved to revive the strands of
                        its detente diplomacy left dangling at the time of the invasion.</p>

                    <p>—By mid-spring 1969, with the publication of the communique at the end of the

                    <p>Thereafter, detente was off and running, with the West in hot pursuit.</p>
                    <p>In short, the Soviet intervention only temporarily set back Soviet detente
                        efforts, while at the same time it allowed the Soviet Union to arrest the
                        deterioration of the situation in Czechoslovakia, which if it had continued,
                        would have had serious consequences not only for Soviet interests in
                        Czechoslovakia, but in East Europe as a whole. (U)</p>
                    <p>In analyzing the diplomatic costs of any intervention in Afghanistan, the
                        Soviets probably concluded that, as with Czechoslovakia, world indignation
                        would be great for a few months, but that this concern would diminish
                        rapidly and six to eight months later they would be able to conduct business
                        as usual—especially if they moved to stamp out the insurgency swiftly and
                        forcefully. At the same time, they probably calculated that with US-Soviet
                        relations at a low ebb, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in limbo, and
                        an election coming up, they had little to lose, and that there was no
                        prospect for a significant change in bilateral relations until after January
                        1981 anyway. Better to take unpleasant action now, and get it over with than
                        be forced to intervene later, when such action might seriously impede
                        chances for an improvement in relations. (C)</p>
                    <p>In sum, Soviet actions in the period immediately following the invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia suggest that Moscow will probably not abandon its detente
                        efforts, but rather resume them after a sufficient interval has elapsed.
                        However, as Fritz has argued, their incentive to do this will be greater if
                        we take rapid and resolute action. If we move swiftly and decisively to meet
                        the Soviet challenge, we may be able to preserve the basis for a balanced
                        policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> over the long run.
                        If we don’t, Moscow’s appetite is likely to increase with the eating,
                        regional insecurity is likely to grow to the detriment of US interests, and
                        the chances of any meaningful cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will be destroyed for years to come.<note n="7" xml:id="d131fn7"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> drew

                    </list>
                    <p>There is a lot of loose talk around the State Department and elsewhere,
                        reflected in the Oberdorfer piece this morning, suggesting that Afghanistan
                        is “the Soviet Vietnam.”<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">See Don Oberdorfer,
                            “The Making of a Soviet Coup,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>,
                            January 2, 1980, p. A1.</note> This is whistling in the dark and the
                        motivation for at least some of this whistling is to provide a rationale for
                        tepid action by the US in response to the Soviet invasion. If the Soviets
                        are going to learn their lesson on the ground in Kabul—so goes the logic of
                        the argument—then there is no important reason for us to pay too large a
                        price in terms of overall US-Soviet relations to show them that this was a
                        wrong decision. (S)</p>
                    <p>However, unless General Pavlovski does not know his business (and I strongly
                        doubt this), the Soviets should have the Afghan situation cleared up in a
                        matter of months. This will require:</p>
                    <p>a. Control of Kabul and all major population centers;</p>
                    <p>b. Control of major roads;</p>
                    <p>c. Control of the major passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan; and</p>
                    <p>d. Effective restriction on the ability of the outside world to obtain solid
                        information on the insurgency (control of the press is vital). (S)</p>
                    <p>Given the above, it will be possible for the Babrak regime to declare the end
                        of the insurgency and to “prove” it by inviting selected outside observers
                        to see for themselves that the country is secure and that “the people”
                        support the government. This should be no trick at all for a major army. It
                        is generally forgotten that the US Army cleared out South Vietnam. In 1971,
                        for example, the entire country was “pacified,” and it was possible to visit
                        every one of the 44 provincial capitals—day or night. If we had shown the
                        ability or inclination to stay in <pb n="361" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_361"/>Vietnam with forces roughly the size of that we had there in 1971 for an
                        indefinite period (a commitment of the kind which the Soviets are obviously
                        ready to make in Afghanistan), then we would clearly have “won” in Vietnam.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>In sum, the war aims of the Soviets in Afghanistan are clear, limited, and
                        achievable in short order. All decisions that we make have to be based on
                        this supposition. My fear is that Afghanistan will not be the Soviet
                        Vietnam; that it will be the Soviet Entebbe.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">A

                    </list>
                    <p>Despite the obvious strategic and historic importance of the Soviet invasion
                        of Afghanistan, there will probably be a tendency to deal with the event in
                        isolation. This will focus debate on such issues as 1) how to impose
                        political costs on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, 2) should we
                        increase support to the Afghan insurgents. (S)</p>
                    <p>To combat that tendency we need to articulate an understanding of the broader
                        crisis and a strategy for dealing with it. Because it so illuminates the
                        weight of Soviet land combat power in the north <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                        Soviet willingness to use it in the most cynical way, the invasion sharply
                        increases the prospect of eventual Soviet military domination of the greater
                        Middle East and US exclusion from the region, except perhaps from Israel.
                        Next we shall very probably see civil strife in Iran with direct Soviet
                        involvement, a <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> take-over of North
                        Yemen, increased <pb n="362" facs="0407" xml:id="pg_362"/>Soviet efforts to
                        destabilize Turkey and Pakistan, and intense Soviet pressure on other states
                        in the region to line up with Soviet interests. (S)</p>
                    <p>The result after several years could be a pattern in the Middle East and
                        South Asia in which most of the region’s states are either Soviet vassals
                        (on the model of Afghanistan) or willing members of a Soviet-dominated
                        security system because it seems the safer course (a role India has come
                        close to playing in the past). (S)</p>
                    <p>US policy overall must be guided by the realization that this prospect is now
                        a fearsome probability, but not a certainty. We must therefore combat the
                        probability as effectively as we can while at the same time planning against
                        its occurrence, without making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. (S)</p>
                    <p>This will require of us a policy of <hi rend="italic">deeply echeloned
                            containment</hi>. In contrast to the situation in the late-1940s and
                        early 1950s, we cannot credibly draw a defensive perimeter and threaten
                        massive military action if it is crossed. There are many perimeters, and
                        some will inevitably be crossed. (S)</p>
                    <p>The first layer, or forward echelon, of our policy must be a systematic
                        effort to make Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia, and
                        Indochina as costly and painful as possible. This will require extensive
                        support to Soviet opponents wherever we find them, not on the basis of their
                        worthiness or chances of winning, but on the basis of their ability to tax
                        Soviet power. We must proceed in this prepared politically and
                        psychologically for the certain event that some of these clients will fail
                        and that our support may after the fact be regarded as having assured their
                        demise. (S)</p>
                    <p>The second layer or echelon of policy should be a three-part effort 1) to
                        fortify as best we can the key remaining buffer states of the area, Turkey
                        and Pakistan, with military and economic aid, 2) to win the key “swing
                        states” of Syria and Iraq away from Soviet influence, and 3) to increase our
                        permanent military presence in the area, <hi rend="italic">on-shore</hi> as
                        well as off-shore. (S)</p>
                    <p>With respect to the first two elements—fortifying the buffers and winning
                        over the “swingers”—the obvious complications of doing these things become
                        politically tolerable if one simply accepts the necessity of trying to
                        achieve them without a prior guarantee, or even high likelihood, of success.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>We need on-shore military presence now mostly for political reasons, to
                        counter the political weight of Soviet military power in the north and to
                        show that we have the nerve to push through the evident political obstacles
                        to get on-shore presence. Over the next year a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> goal should be a tac air contingent and marine presence in
                        Oman. The risk of destabilizing Oman will simply have to be taken. Oman is
                            <pb n="363" facs="0408" xml:id="pg_363"/>no safer in our absence. But we
                        should also start planning for a more ambitious option of inserting the
                        necessary land, air, and naval forces into Saudi Arabia and the Gulf to
                        protect Gulf oil against direct attack or stoppage of oil flow through
                        political side effects of events elsewhere. All this, incidentally, calls
                        for the prompt creation of the greater Middle East command we have talked
                        about. (S)</p>
                    <p>Another element of this second layer of policy we must examine carefully, but
                        not necessarily decide as yet is: under what conditions of Soviet
                        involvement in Iran would we be prepared to put US forces into Iran? (S)</p>
                    <p>The third echelon of policy should be a composite of actions to increase the
                        level and tempo of our overall defense effort in the context of more active
                        measures to restore national economic health. It is probably not necessary
                        to revisit the President’s FY81 defense budget decisions now. But against
                        the likely picture of the 1980s, the President’s conception of adequate
                        spending levels in the out years is almost certainly too low. Instead of
                        4.5–5.0% annual increases, we shall be forced into something like 6.0–7.0%
                        rates or even higher. What we need now is a major (not a back room, or
                        one-man) planning effort on how to accomplish this acceleration. Undoubtedly
                        other dimensions of this “quasi-mobilization” policy will involve stiff oil
                        import taxes, tax changes to stimulate investment, somewhat looser monetary
                        policy, and perhaps price controls to manage inflation. (S)</p>
                    <p>The fourth echelon of policy will involve political efforts on a broad front
                        to get our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies and Japan to do
                        likewise in defense. (S)</p>
                    <p>The fifth policy echelon will involve the way we manage our direct
                        relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The foregoing
                        may suggest that we will have foresworn any semblance of detente for the
                        next decade. Quite the contrary is the case. If we move swiftly to create
                        the necessary echelons of containment, we may preserve the basis for a
                        balanced policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in
                        bilateral relations and in Europe. (S)</p>
                    <p>US resolve and effectiveness in the East-West competition will actually
                        restore in Moscow an incentive to try to deflect us by political means, an
                        incentive that has obviously declined in recent years. We must move to place
                        issues of regional stability at the center of our bilateral relationship
                        where the Soviets will be forced to deal with them. Faced with the certainty
                        of stiff competition on all fronts the Soviets will, in time, at least show
                        an interest in damping that competition in some regions. In the meantime,
                        there is no reason why the dialogue on strategic arms stabilization cannot
                        in due course resume. The Soviets will probably have an interest in it. The
                        main obstacle to our pursuing a nuanced or balanced policy now is the lack
                        of confidence at home, e.g., in the Senate, that we are adequately postured
                        for the competitive side of the relationship. (S)</p>
                    <p><pb n="364" facs="0409" xml:id="pg_364"/>Even at this late date, I doubt that
                        the Soviets fully appreciate the depth of the national about-face taking
                        place here. They seem to believe that US-Soviet relations can be returned to
                        the uncertain mix of the last several years after the elections, that the
                        competitive elements of our policy will be ineffective, and that our allies
                        can be coaxed away from us. Only US actions across all the policy echelons
                        discussed above will sober their outlook. But the chances for peace in the
                        next five years would be improved if somebody were to go to Moscow now, not
                        to negotiate or to debate, but to tell the Soviets exactly how we view the
                        period of struggle ahead. That person should have the absolute confidence of
                        the President and labor under no suspicions that his mission is to rescue
                        detente by acquiescing in Soviet power grabs. You’re the only candidate with
                        the credibility to do this. (S)</p>

                    <p>You should seek to accomplish four things in response to the Soviet invasion
                        of Afghanistan:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">In Afghanistan</hi>. Make the costs to the Soviets very
                        high, preventing a successful Soviet consolidation of power there if
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In the Region</hi>. Accelerate a number of measures and
                        take additional steps to build a security system in the Persian Gulf which
                        can repel Soviet power projection into the region.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">Documentation on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            efforts to build a security framework in the Persian Gulf area in the
                            wake of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the Soviet invasion of
                            Afghanistan is in <ref target="frus1977-80v18"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                Arabian Peninsula</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">With our Allies</hi>. Assert leadership of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance and Japan which provides a
                        context and a rationale for our allies’ supporting actions.</p>
                    <p><pb n="365" facs="0410" xml:id="pg_365"/>4. <hi rend="italic">With Broader
                            Groups</hi>. Provide a context and rationale for broader groups, such as
                        the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>, Moslem states, and the United
                        Nations, to take as much action as they are willing.</p>
                    <p>If the United States is clearly understood to be providing this leadership,
                        you will not only get the backing of our allies and many non-aligned states,
                        but you will also find an emerging domestic consensus behind you that will
                        support essential legislative and budgetary measures. Anything less will
                        cause vacillation and accommodation by our allies and by states within the
                        Persian Gulf region.</p>
                    <p>This is not a crisis to be dealt with in a few weeks and with a series of
                        short-term measures. It is a test of the balance of power between East and
                        West. Many states will be forced to adjust their foreign policy to the way
                        in which you exercise the leadership of the West. The major political
                        problem for world affairs in the 1980s is the projection of Soviet military
                        power. Our sensitive intelligence indicates that many political leaders in
                        the world have come to see this clearly. If it appears that the United
                        States cannot stem Soviet power effectively through diplomacy, alliances,
                        and military means, then they will continue accommodating to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan is not only the first country outside the Soviet bloc which the
                        Soviet armed forces have invaded since 1945. It is also the <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> state since 1975 in which communist parties
                        have come to power with Soviet guns and tanks, with Soviet military advisors
                        and assistance (Vietnam, Angola, Laos, South Yemen, Cambodia, Ethiopia, <hi rend="italic">and Afghanistan</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Four of these
                            takeovers have occurred since January 1977.</hi> We can expect the
                        number to rise considerably above the present seven unless the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can galvanize effective resistance.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">basic decision</hi> for you is whether to jeopardize a
                        number of your present policies (arms transfers, nuclear proliferation, and
                        arms control) and make a comprehensive and long-term response to check
                        Soviet power <hi rend="italic">or</hi> to treat the Afghanistan affair as a
                        minor episode in the competitive-cooperative mix of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Soviet Union relations, chastise the Soviets, take several
                        symbolic measures in retribution, and then begin adjusting to the reality of
                        Soviet power in Afghanistan and the destabilization of the Persian Gulf
                        region it portends. I strongly urge you to make this a turning point at
                        which you begin a sustained and comprehensive strategy for preventing the
                        expansion of Soviet power projection.</p>
                    <p>The context for a major strategic turn is four classes of actions involving
                        three interrelated regions. The regions are the Persian Gulf, Europe, and
                        East Asia. We have an alliance system and military deployments in two of
                        these regions. We are only beginning to create a significant military
                        posture in the third, the Persian Gulf. Actions in response to the Soviet
                        invasion of Afghanistan should be <pb n="366" facs="0411" xml:id="pg_366"/>taken in the context of first, the specific needs of the Persian Gulf
                        region and second, the interrelation of the three regions. The classes of
                        actions are:</p>
                    <quote><p>—those with states in the Persian Gulf region;</p>
                        <p>—those involving our allies and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>—those purely bilateral in nature;</p>
                        <p>—those involving other groups of states (e.g. the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>).</p></quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Actions for the Persian Gulf region.</p>
                    <p>They should be directed at three objectives: (a) a de facto security system
                        for the Saudi Arabian peninsula, (b) restoration of the “northern tier”
                        (Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan), and (c) support of the insurgents in
                        Afghanistan. They should include at a minimum:</p>
                    <quote><p>—a direct offer of large military assistance to Pakistan;</p>
                        <p>—speed up of our acquisition of bases and a new unified military command
                            structure for the region;</p>
                        <p>—covert action in South Yemen and Eritrea as well as in Iran and
                            Afghanistan;</p>
                        <p>—an aid package for Turkey (funded almost entirely by Bonn and perhaps
                            other European allies) in exchange for Turkish help in Iran and with
                            Pakistan.</p></quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Actions involving our Allies.</p>
                    <p>These must provide a structure for allied support. Our well-established
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> programs, the <gloss target="#t_LTDP_1">LTDP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss>, and the commitment to three percent increases in defense
                        spending offer a military context. Economic measures toward the Persian Gulf
                        and Moscow offer another context. Political steps provide a third context.
                        The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, of course, is a separate but
                        important factor. These actions should include as a minimum:</p>

                                convened in January 1980, but failed to adopt a resolution calling

                    <p>It is probably unwise to take all of these actions at once, and as events
                        develop, some might look less attractive. It is wise, I believe, to select
                        several of them in each of the five categories for immediate execution and
                        to begin study and consideration of all the others.</p>

                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as these actions are implemented.
                        First, Moscow will lose the diplomatic attention and appeal it has enjoyed
                        throughout the 1970s from the West and the Third World. Second, the Soviet
                        economy, showing signs of entropy for two decades, has sustained some growth
                        in no small part through interaction with the West. Your actions,
                        particularly if they threaten to include the Europeans and Japan, promise
                        sharpening economic difficulties within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the Soviet bloc. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> may not yield to economic pressures, but in the

                        access has an unambiguous price. That should strengthen the hand of those in
                        the Politburo who argue that foreign military adventures cost far more than
                        they are worth.</p>

                    <p>The President began by saying that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        would first discuss Iran and Pakistan and then reduce the membership to the
                        statutory members for a more private session.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren
                            Christopher</persName> to report on his meeting with the allies in
                        London and at the North Atlantic Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d107fn2">footnote 2, Document 107</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The Deputy Secretary of State said that he had met in London with five
                        countries’ representatives and then went on to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in Brussels to meet with the permanent representatives. He
                        said that the people he met with were serious and in a somber mood. He would
                        like to cover several points as a backdrop to the specific decisions which
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> confronted.</p>
                    <p>First, everyone recognized that the invasion of Afghanistan was a new
                        dimension in Soviet policy. No ally challenged the Deputy Secretary’s
                        statement that it was a major departure in Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>France apparently toyed with the idea that the invasion of Afghanistan was
                        simply an extension of their “surrogate” activities in Ethiopia, South Yemen
                        and Angola, but they came off this position quickly. <pb n="371" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_371"/>There was general consensus that the Soviets also
                        recognize that this is a major departure and were prepared to run the risks
                        entailed.</p>
                    <p>Second, the consequences of Soviet action were related to its scope and its
                        persistence. Several of the Allied representatives had experience with the
                        Czech invasion and the Hungarian invasion. They agreed that our response
                        cannot be modest nor short-lived. The allies are willing to consider both
                        positive and negative steps. As to the nature of these steps, the allies
                        were prepared to take “serious steps,” steps that would lead back from
                        detente, steps that would hurt themselves even as they signalled to the
                        Soviet Union our displeasure.</p>
                    <p>Third, the allies emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>
                        decisions reached only a few weeks ago were clearly necessary decisions.
                        They also expressed the hope that the qualifications of Belgium and the
                        Netherlands would now be dropped. However, neither Belgium nor the
                        Netherlands indicated that they would take this step. Nonetheless, there was
                        a concurrence that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> leadership
                        moving ahead on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> deployments was all the
                        more valid in the light of subsequent Soviet activities in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the allies were quite prepared to come to the aid of Pakistan and
                        other countries which might be threatened by these developments.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether India was discussed. The Deputy Secretary replied
                        yes. He said that even if the Indians rationalize the invasion and downplay
                        it, down deep they will be worried. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The Deputy Secretary explained that two groups had been set up: (1) to
                        consider and discuss retaliatory actions towards the Soviets; and (2) to
                        coordinate aid to Pakistan. The Deputy Secretary said that these groups
                        could come under the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> umbrella or they
                        could be broadened from the six to include Japan. The Deputy Secretary
                        thought that it was important that both in retaliation to the Soviets and
                        aid to Pakistan we could use as many participants as possible.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> in Pakistan said that the aid to Pakistan should not
                        be under <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. The President noted that
                        the French also were anxious not to coordinate under <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense expressed the hope that the Saudis and Japanese
                        could join the group. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        said that we may wish to expand it to include Australia. <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> suggested that the Pakistani
                        aid consortium countries might be used for the economic aid
                        coordination.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what countries in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        might raise the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, absent <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> leadership. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> replied that we have had a
                        report that a number of countries want to do it—several Gulf states, four to
                        five <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> countries, as well as <pb n="372" facs="0417" xml:id="pg_372"/>several of our allies. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked whether these
                        countries are willing to go by themselves. The Secretary of State replied
                        no; leadership had to come from others. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> is holding a meeting with other Western countries to
                        consider drafting a letter to the President of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked whether there
                        was a possibility that the United Kingdom, Pakistan and China might
                        co-sponsor an effort to raise this in the Security Council. The Secretary of
                        State said that he did not believe the Pakistanis would participate in
                        something like that.</p>
                    <p>The President again asked whether any country was prepared to take the
                        initiative apart from the United States. The Secretary of State replied the
                        United Kingdom, France, Portugal—they are on the Security Council, but they
                        will want to join with us. Norway would be with us as a member of the
                        Western group. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked
                        if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has to be a co-sponsor of this
                        effort. The Secretary of State replied yes.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had read about the experience in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> during the Soviet invasion of
                            Czechoslovakia.<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">See <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations, 1968</hi>, pp. 298–304.</note> It
                        had been a mistake going to the Security Council first. They debated it for
                        a long time and ultimately the Soviet Union vetoed any action. Then, when
                        efforts were made to go to the General Assembly, so much time had elapsed
                        that no action was taken.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State noted that the General Assembly was still in session
                        and that we could go there next week. He said that one advantage of that
                        would be to single out Cuba and force it to take a position in the General
                        Assembly. The disadvantage is that the Soviets, as well as a number of
                        Warsaw Pact nations, will argue that their actions were consistent with

                        Warsaw Pact nations would ask to come before the Security Council on behalf
                        of the Soviet Pact position, although the <gloss target="#t_GDR_1">GDR</gloss>, which is on the Security Council, would undoubtedly be
                        supportive of the Russians.</p>
                    <p>The Deputy Secretary of State summarized by saying that if we are prepared to
                        join and appeal to the Security Council President to put this issue on the
                        agenda, many other countries would join as well.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether we should go to the Security Council when the
                        Soviets would always veto anything we propose there. The Secretary of State
                        responded that we could go under Chapter VI (peaceful settlement of
                        disputes) and since they are involved, they will not have the right of a
                        veto.</p>
                    <p><pb n="373" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_373"/>The President noted that Chapter VI
                        says that an accused state has no vote, but that there were also no punitive
                        actions which could be taken under Chapter VI. He wondered whether we
                        shouldn’t go to the General Assembly as well. The Deputy Secretary of State
                        commented that our allies say that this is a Chapter VII, Article 39 issue—a
                        threat to the peace, not a simple dispute among countries.<note n="5" xml:id="d135fn5">Article 39, Chapter VII of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter, “Action With Respect to Threats to Peace,
                            Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression,” reads: “The Security
                            Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach
                            of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or
                            decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and
                            42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.” Article 41
                            discusses the non-military measures <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            members may take in protest against aggression as defined in Article 39.

                            members may take if the non-military measures described in Article 41
                            prove inadequate.</note></p>
                    <p>The President asked what we would get out of a Security Council session in
                        view of the possibility of a Soviet veto. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said that the Soviets would pay a high political
                        price for a veto. We could then go to the General Assembly. The Secretary of
                        State said that we could go to both at the same time. The President said
                        that he also thought of that possibility. He said the Czech example was
                        disappointing because after a while it was only possible to get <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> support for our opposition to the Soviet
                        invasion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense said that we are likely to have the same experience
                        in this instance. We will not get sanctions nor military action, but we will
                        get a backdrop for individual actions taken by the allied groups set up by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked what forum would
                        be best for a punitive public relations exercise. He thought that probably
                        the General Assembly, but that would depend on what the members are prepared
                        to do. In the Security Council, he noted, we can already tell who will
                        support strong action and who will equivocate. The Secretary of State was of
                        the opinion that Bangladesh will not vote against the Soviets in the final
                        analysis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense repeated that, nonetheless, the Security Council
                        debate would provide a positive backdrop for actions to be developed in the
                        groups set up by <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren
                        Christopher</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that there was a strong desire by Western nations
                        to take this issue to the Security Council. We do not want to be in a
                        position of blocking this effort. The question is whether we should also go
                        to the General Assembly while it is still in session.</p>
                    <p>The President said his preference would be to go to both the General Assembly
                        and the Security Council. We should go as far as we can and try to get
                        others to join us. He concluded by saying he was willing <pb n="374" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_374"/>to accept going only to the Security
                        Council until he had read about our experience during the Czech
                        invasion.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> endorsed the idea of
                        going both to the General Assembly and the Security Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> said he thought it would make the
                        price of a veto much higher for the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked whether Warren
                        could do both. The Secretary of State thought the answer was yes. He said we
                        will get arguments against it, but he thought it was possible. The President
                        noted that if the Soviets are on the verge of vetoing this matter in the
                        Security Council, it would hurt them in the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>The President summarized by saying that he thought we ought to go all out in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and in other respects in regard to
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He said he was convinced that we will
                        not be able to get the Soviets to pull out of Afghanistan, but Soviet
                        actions over the next ten to twenty years will be colored by our behavior in
                        this crisis. The President said that if the Gulf states and others are too
                        timid, we should go with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies
                        and China to try to do the maximum, short of a world war, to make the
                        Soviets see that this was a major mistake.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> noted that if we go
                        forward in the Security Council on Afghanistan at the same time as the Iran
                        discussion, the Soviets could veto our sanctions resolution.<note n="6" xml:id="d135fn6">On January 11, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council began consideration of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-sponsored draft resolution calling for the release of
                            the American hostages being held in Iran and the imposition of various
                            sanctions on Iran. See <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations,
                                1980</hi>, pp. 309–312.</note> He also thought the Soviets would use
                        the fact that the Security Council would only have 14 members as an excuse
                        for them to veto any resolution on Iran on procedural grounds.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense and others thought that this would be true in any
                        event, whether or not we pursued Afghanistan in the Security Council. The
                        President agreed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State asked whether he could give instructions to <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">Don McHenry</persName> to join a letter to the
                        President of the Security Council and to urge others to also address this
                        issue in the General Assembly. The President approved this suggestion but
                        added that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> ought
                        to tell others that our preference is to go to the General Assembly, unless
                        it would violate the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> asked that whatever we do,
                        we ought to do it as a package. He realized that consultations take time,
                        but if we dribbled out each of our decisions over several days, we would
                        lose the impact of Presidential leadership. The Secretary of State responded
                        by saying <pb n="375" facs="0420" xml:id="pg_375"/>that we cannot hold back
                        on going to the Security Council. Otherwise we will be dragging our feet.
                        There was a meeting today on this issue.</p>
                    <p>The President said that we should go forward on the Security Council and
                        should not wait for a package. (The Secretary of State then left to call
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said we should now go
                        through the separate steps in the paper prepared by the State
                            Department.<note n="7" xml:id="d135fn7"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> read the December 31 paper, entitled
                            “Afghanistan: Steps in the Framework of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet Relations,” in advance of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting. A copy with <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s marginalia is in the Carter
                            Library, National Security Council Institutional Files, 1977–1981, Box
                            57, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>–026, 01/02/80, Afghanistan

                            first paragraph of the paper reads: “There are three kinds of impacts we
                            hope to achieve vis-à-vis the Soviets in Afghanistan. The first is
                            punitive: we want them to pay a price for infringing on fundamental
                            principles of international behavior. The second is coercive: we want
                            them to withdraw their troops and allow Afghanistan to return to a
                            semblance of sovereignty and neutrality. The third is deterrent: we want
                            to prevent the Soviets from crossing further thresholds, such as hot
                            pursuit of rebels across international frontiers or escalation of the
                            fighting with the rebels to a massive scale.” In the right margin beside
                            the paragraph, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “1
                            &amp; 3 inter-related, 2 unlikely.” The second paragraph reads: “We are
                            also interested in the impact of our responses on other international
                            actors, including European allies, nervous Eastern Europeans, nonaligned
                            Third World countries, and Islamic governments. Thus, even actions that
                            may make little impression on the Soviets can be of value for other
                            audiences; some US actions could cause concern to our allies.” In the
                            right margin beside this paragraph, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “Maximum initiative &amp; action by
                            others.” The second and third sentences of the fourth paragraph read:
                            “Soviet reactions may also take the form of countermoves across a broad
                            spectrum. In choosing one course of action over another, the
                            irrevocability of the action will be one important factor to consider.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> underlined “Soviet
                            reactions,” and in the right margin wrote: “need to assess.” The final
                            sentence of the paper reads: “Certain steps affecting US-Soviet
                            relations may have the desired effect on other countries, but the most
                            effective steps in getting our point across to Moscow are likely to be
                            those that strengthen opposition to the Soviets worldwide.” <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> underlined “Soviets worldwide,”
                            and wrote: “true” in the right margin. The table of contents of the
                            December 31 paper, which lists the proposed actions, is printed in <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d249"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                    <p>The President agreed and asked that <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren
                            Christopher</persName> please indicate what the allied reaction was to
                        each of the specific measures.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said the first issue
                        was <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The President said that he had
                        talked to <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Robert Byrd</persName> and the
                        Majority Leader wanted to keep <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> on the
                        calendar but not bring it up onto the Floor.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had been able to persuade <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName> not to make a statement to that
                        effect when he left the White House. It was the President’s view that we
                        ought to leave it on the calendar and maintain our approach of working
                        closely with the Majority Leader on this issue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> was important regardless of our
                        relationship to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>S.R., but we will
                        have to accept that at this time it is not advisable to bring it to a vote.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> agreed. There was
                            <pb n="376" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_376"/>no sense to withdraw it
                        completely since it was in our security interest, but that we cannot get the
                        requisite [votes?] as long as Iran and Afghanistan are unresolved.
                        Therefore, he thought we should defer bringing it to the Floor but leave it
                        on the calendar. However, if the Soviets veto sanctions on Iran, we may have
                        to look even at the possibility of withdrawing it from the calendar.</p>
                    <p>The President said that <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Robert Byrd</persName>
                        had reminded him that the Executive Branch has no control over the Senate’s
                        calendar and that he, the President, could not pull it back by himself.
                        However, he indicated that he would be prepared to consult with us and
                        cooperate.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense said the most we can do is to keep <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> alive. He thought that as part of our
                        rationale we could explain that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> was
                        in our global interest, but that since other negotiations, such as the
                        Indian Ocean talks, were affected by the movement into Afghanistan, we would
                        terminate them. We would make clear the Soviets have removed the basis for
                        Indian Ocean arms control which was to reduce great power rivalry in the
                        region. On the other hand, the basis for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> was to lessen the danger of nuclear war and avoid an arms
                        race in the nuclear area, particularly when our priorities were to increase
                        our conventional capabilities. Therefore, we were not pulling back the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Treaty. We were simply not going
                        forward onto the Floor with it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said he thought that
                        leaving arms control activities out of the measures of retaliation against
                        the Soviet Union is consistent with the position that had been adopted with
                        our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies. He pointed to the
                        continuation of <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> in this connection.
                        Moreover, singling out the Indian [Ocean] talks for rejection would be
                        unwise since the Soviets would exploit this with a new Indian government.
                        However, given that it is dead already, he would be in favor of simply
                        leaving it moribund.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> explained that the
                        Indian Ocean negotiations were not concerned with arms control but rather
                        with arms deployments. He said he was tempted to say that this was true for
                        the conventional arms talks as well. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> replied that if we are trying to pursue punitive
                        action, this did not help since the Indian Ocean talks were already dead.
                        Moreover, it would not enhance our position or embarrass them because they
                        could turn cancellation of the Indian Ocean talks against us with the
                        Indians.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State agreed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>. As for the conventional arms talks, he felt it
                        should be left on the table. But he would not go forward with the meeting
                        next week between the heads of delegation. On <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, he thought it was important to leave it on the calendar.
                        He reported that Senator <persName corresp="#p_HG_1">Hart</persName> and
                        others had heard that <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Robert Byrd</persName>
                        had urged that we pull it all the way back. The President said no, Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName> did not want to do
                        that.</p>
                    <p><pb n="377" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_377"/>The Deputy Secretary of State said
                        that the Europeans place great store by <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. They would like the approach that we are considering.
                        They want to keep other arms control negotiations going. On <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>, the ball is in the Soviet court anyway.
                        Our action to defer <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> would be widely
                        understood by our European allies.</p>
                    <p>Turning back to the State Department paper of proposed actions, it was noted
                        that the proposed Presidential statement on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations had already been made by the President as
                        had the recall of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>.
                        The latter would be announced today. The suggestion to restrict social and
                        official contact with Soviet officials was described by the Secretary of
                        State as not effective in previous circumstances and therefore was
                        dropped.</p>
                    <p>In the discussion of the question of reducing the Soviet diplomatic staff,
                        the President indicated his desire to make the two staffs equal. The
                        Secretary of State commented that in retaliation the Soviets will finger our
                        most important people. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said then we both go down hill and they get the
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that the Soviet Union placed limits on the number of
                        diplomatic personnel that we may have. We place no such limits on them. He
                        said he was against continuing an unbalanced approach with the Soviets. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> added that some
                        greater reciprocity was certainly in order.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State pointed to the fact that the imbalance in
                        representation was due in large measure to the existence of the new Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Mission. The Secretary of Defense
                        suggested that we separate out the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Mission as a separate matter. <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd
                            Cutler</persName> suggested we might freeze the level of Soviet
                        representation at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to keep that from
                        being a circumvention of a reduction of the embassy in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Frank Carlucci</persName> pointed out that we do not
                        have legal authority to do this.</p>
                    <p>The President again repeated that he was in favor of cutting back the Soviet
                        Embassy representation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> recalled that when the
                        British expelled the Soviet intelligence agents, they warned the Soviet
                        Union that if the Soviets retaliated, they would expel additional Soviet
                        personnel on a proportional basis. That deterred further Soviet expulsions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Frank Carlucci</persName> added that the
                        British, however, regretted this action because they found that they had a
                        much more difficult time following and identifying the new Soviet agents
                        which were brought back into the country subsequently.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked what the disparity is in numbers. The Secretary of
                        State said two to one. <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Frank
                            Carlucci</persName> said it’s 1,240 Soviets versus 164 <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the Soviet Union, including the United
                        Nations Mission.</p>

                        specific proposal on how to equalize representation. The President concluded
                        by saying that he was inclined to do it. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not
                            declassified</hi>] It was agreed to suspend preparation for the opening
                        of Consulates General in Kiev and New York.</p>
                    <p>The President was not inclined to raise the level of human rights criticism
                        which he felt ought to proceed as vigorously as the situation warranted.
                        However, it was agreed to step up Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe and Voice
                        of America broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said we would need a
                        small amount of money from <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> for this
                        purpose. The President asked what the allies were doing and the Deputy
                        Secretary of State said that the British were willing to be very
                        cooperative. In this connection, it was agreed to do all we could to
                        publicize the Soviet role in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>On the question of recognition, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we have taken the position that we will
                        not resume normal business. But we have left our personnel there.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that he had already taken out all of the AID and
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> personnel and he wants to cut the
                        rest of the staff to a minimum.<note n="8" xml:id="d135fn8">See <ref target="#d110fn4">footnote 4, Document 110</ref>.</note> He said all
                        we have in Kabul at the present time is the Charge d’affaires. The President
                        said he agreed with that if we can fulfill our requirements with a reduced
                        staff. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The Deputy Secretary of State said that the allies were willing to refrain
                        from political contacts with the new regime. Only two of the countries have
                        the specific policy of recognizing governments, Great Britain and Canada.
                        Neither of them would recognize the new regime. Italy and the Federal
                        Republic of Germany will withdraw their ambassadors. Bilateral aid will be
                        withdrawn or frozen. Multilateral aid through the World Bank—the allies will
                        be prepared to join with us in seeking termination. In this connection, the
                        Deputy Secretary of State noted that the international financial
                        institutions were providing aid for Afghanistan on the basis that it was a
                        non-aligned country. But there was now no such basis since Afghanistan was
                        becoming a puppet of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The President was then informed by a message from the Secretary of Labor that
                        the longshoremen were on the verge of enforcing embargo on the shipment to
                        the United States of grain.<note n="9" xml:id="d135fn9">On January 9, the
                            International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) unilaterally declared a
                            boycott on all cargo destined to or arriving from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in ports from Maine to Texas. An
                            article in <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> magazine quoted ILA President
                            Teddy Gleason, who pledged that the boycott would remain “as long as the
                            Soviets insist on being international bullyboys.” (“Grain Becomes a
                            Weapon,” <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>, January 21, 1980)</note></p>
                    <p><pb n="379" facs="0424" xml:id="pg_379"/>The Secretary of State said that he
                        thought that we will have to cut back on grain shipments to the 8 million
                        tons required by our agreement with the Soviet Union from the 25 million
                        tons that were now projected and for which contracts had been let. Without
                        such an action, we do not believe our allies would do anything in the way of
                        economic restrictions or penalties to the Soviet Union. He knew this would
                        be a high price to pay but it would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>The President wondered whether the longshoremen were going to do it, it was
                        not simply up to them. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> agreed. He thought the President could decide
                        later whether the United States would impose an official embargo.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Jody Powell</persName> asked if we would have
                        difficulty selling the grain elsewhere. The Secretary of State said that we
                        would have to buy and store the grain. The President noted that this was a
                        considerable amount of wheat and corn. The Secretary of State reviewed our
                        commitments. Our agreement with the Soviet Union requires that we sell 8
                        million tons. Moreover, we had approved the sale of another 25 million tons.
                        The Secretary said that the issue was whether we were formally required by
                        law to sell the additional 25–35 million tons.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense noted that this was a considerable amount of money,
                        approximately $5 billion in foreign exchange earnings for the United States.
                        The Vice President said that the market would drop right away. Prices would
                        reflect the fact that the sale had not been made. Storage of this much wheat
                        by the United States would be regarded as cash and corn and wheat prices
                        will drop immediately.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> said assuming this is the
                        situation, is there something we could do to compensate, to buy and store
                        the wheat? The Secretary of Defense said it was a timing question. If the
                        price breaks at the announcement of an embargo, then we will only halt the
                        slide by buying it off the market.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> said he thought it sounded
                        like the total embargo by the longshoremen, not simply a wheat embargo.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President expressed strong concern that labor and farmers will split
                        on this issue. He said we could not afford being involved, for we will be
                        dragged into court immediately and we will have to take a position.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> said that it would
                        be better for the President to do it than to be coerced into it by the
                        longshoremen.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> said that he would feel
                        more comfortable if <persName corresp="#p_BR_3">Bob Bergland</persName> and
                        Ray Marshall could explain all the details of this issue before deciding.
                        The President said he thought we should go on to the proposed list of
                        actions by the State Department and consider this issue separately.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked about France and what they would do in regard to
                        relations with the new regime. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren
                            Christopher</persName> said <pb n="380" facs="0425" xml:id="pg_380"/>that they would agree on no new contacts. However, it was not a question
                        of recognition for them. They will follow the lead of others and not engage
                        in any political contact at this time. They may go so far as to recall their
                        ambassador. They are prepared to make some strong signal, but they do not
                        want to close their mission.</p>
                    <p>The President then called <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Stuart
                            Eizenstat</persName> and asked him to check on the longshoremen embargo
                        issue and report to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> as soon as he
                        possibly could.</p>
                    <p>The Deputy Secretary of State concluded by saying that we should follow up on
                        cancelling loans and on making no new loans by the World Bank.</p>
                    <p>Turning to other bilateral measures, the Secretary of State said that he
                        would stonewall on Consular review talks. They were in recess and would not
                        be resumed.</p>
                    <p>The suggestion to reimpose the travel ban on Soviet New York advance party
                        personnel had been overtaken by events.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that we should refuse and delay visas for official Soviet
                        visitors on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary of Defense specifically
                        mentioned <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Gregory Arbatov</persName> in this
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>On the question of reducing Soviet media representation in the United States,
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Jody Powell</persName> said that he had a
                        mixed reaction. He felt that like diplomats we should go to the principle of
                        equality but there may, of course, be retaliation and we could end with no
                        one in Moscow. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>] So on
                        balance he felt we could run the risk. The President approved.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of exchanges, there was a discussion of both the
                        scientific exchanges and the transfer of the magnetohydrodynamic channel as
                        well as certain meetings that had been scheduled. The Secretary of State
                        said that he would urge that Representative Bill Green not take his
                        congressional delegation to Moscow. Also, he would propose cancelling the
                        Joint Committee Meeting in Moscow to be chaired by Hathaway and he would
                        postpone the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health scheduled for
                        mid-February in Washington. On the MHD channel, the Secretary said that
                        transport of that piece of equipment by C–5 aircraft to Moscow would have
                        enormous publicity. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        said we could defer that instead of cancelling it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> noted that we had a lot of money
                        invested into it, approximately $10 million.</p>
                    <p>The Deputy Secretary of State said that they would review for approval any
                        proposed formal meetings between the Soviet officials in the United States
                        at the Assistant Secretary level or above. The President approved review but
                        said that he would be reluctant to approve such contacts.</p>
                    <p><pb n="381" facs="0426" xml:id="pg_381"/>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said the next and most delicate issue was that of
                        the Olympics. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>
                        said there was strong feeling in Europe against participating in the
                        Olympics. He said that the West German representative at <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> said that while it was difficult for the
                        German representatives to comment on events in Germany in the 1930’s, it was
                        his view that the western nations should not have come to Berlin in the
                        1930’s. He felt the same way about the Moscow Olympics.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we could
                        take the position that we will consider boycotting the Olympics. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> said we must strike while
                        the iron is hot if we are serious about boycotting the Olympics. If we could
                        get a few large countries such as the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                        to begin to join us, then we could ask others to go along. But if we are
                        trying to get a lot of others and have to slog it out, he thought that
                        support for boycotting would disintegrate. <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> said that we should only do this if it were
                        combined with other strong measures. It should not be the major step that we
                        take. He thought that we could control participation through our control of
                        passports since the Olympics was a private matter. He also suggested that we
                        organize alternative games so that participants would have an opportunity to
                        still compete.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State disagreed with the latter point. He said we should
                        decide as a country whether we are going to participate and not get involved
                        with the work of the Olympic committees. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> thought we needed to publicly call on our allies to
                        participate. If we wait to fight toward a broader consensus, the allies
                        won’t be with us.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said
                        that he thought a boycott of the Olympics would take us too far down the
                        road. Taking that one non-political contact and using it in this way would
                        be destructive of international communication and sense of community. And we
                        should consider the athletes who reach their peak every four years and for
                        whom this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. He said he thought boycotting
                        the Olympics would be a very harsh move which the American people will not
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State stated that it depended on our decision on grain
                        sales. If we do that we would not need to take the step in regard to the
                        Olympics.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> took a contrary view. He
                        felt we could only boycott the Olympics if we took strong economic
                        sanctions; otherwise we would trivialize our actions by only focussing on
                        the Olympics.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said our position does
                        depend on the others. If we go ahead it will be interpreted as business as
                        usual. But with others we could join them in underscoring the seriousness
                        with which the world community regards the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that a move like this could capture the imagination
                        of the American people.</p>
                    <p><pb n="382" facs="0427" xml:id="pg_382"/>The President said it sent cold
                        chills down his spine.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> said we could, as an
                        alternative, organize some alternative games here.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said if thirty
                        countries stay out of the Olympics then we will have accomplished something.
                        If only three stay out, we should not do it. The President noted that the
                        winter Olympics will take place here and that they might organize a boycott
                        against us.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> repeated that we must
                        not boycott the Olympics without also taking action on grain. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> agreed. He said, however,
                        that the Soviets are more concerned about the Olympics than grain. It was
                        designed to show them as acceptable. But he agreed we could not do the
                        Olympic boycott without a restrictive decision on grain sales.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded by saying that we should take the position that our
                        participation was raised by European countries and we will assess and review
                        this position. He said we should be prepared to make it our public posture
                        that others have advanced the idea of non-participation in the Olympic games
                        and that we are considering it, taking into account the position of other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of travel control, the President said it irritated
                        him that the United States was subject to travel controls that they were
                        not. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said it was not
                        a question of control. We both have controls. It was a question of
                        enforcement and permissiveness on our part.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>
                        suggested that their proposals on the level of representation also ought to
                        include recommendations concerning travel restrictions and enforcement. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> added that these
                        recommendations point towards more reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>Turning to military measures, it was agreed that a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military alert was inappropriate. As far as increasing the
                        United States permanent military presence in the Indian Ocean and Persian
                        Gulf, that was already underway.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the economic actions, it was agreed that we would not do anything
                        about the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>. There was concern
                        expressed by the Vice President and the Secretary of State that the Soviets
                        could retaliate by cutting Jewish immigration.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of credits, the Secretary of Defense asked how much
                        help we might expect from our allies on curbing trade and credit. Deputy
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> replied that
                        that depends on what we do about grain. He said that the allies have major
                        credit agreements coming up for renewal and he was of the opinion that they
                        were prepared not to renew them if we were similarly going to take strong
                        action.</p>
                    <p><pb n="383" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_383"/>The President said that he hoped
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> was correct
                        and that the French and Japanese would not run in and take advantage of our
                        restraint. He said that we ought to make a maximum effort to get our allies
                        behind us. He suggested that a message be prepared right after the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting giving the allies a rundown on
                        what we had decided to do.</p>
                    <p>The planned joint commercial meeting and business facilitation talks were
                        discussed and it was agreed that they should be postponed indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>It was also agreed to postpone the Civil Aviation Talks. The President also
                        agreed that for the time being Aeroflot would be strictly restricted to two
                        flights weekly as authorized by our existing agreement.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of export controls and possible tightening, the
                        Secretary of State asked what we were talking about in specific terms. The
                        President said that he favored tightening our export controls on a
                        case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that this gets into the problem that we will have
                        with the farmers if we have a grain embargo. They will feel that the
                        businessmen are left off the hook if we do not make a similar tightening in
                        trade in industrial goods.</p>
                    <p>The President noted under <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> we would
                        tighten our restrictions together with the allies. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName> pointed out, however, that
                        this only dealt with sensitive exports and technology and did not deal with
                        lots of other trade.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that we send someone to <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> and to talk with our allies about tightening up on trade
                        with the Soviet Union. He said he was in favor of tightening our trade even
                        more than the allies so long as it did not disadvantage the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> businessmen in comparison with our allies.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that he would
                        instruct Commerce and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> accordingly.</p>
                    <p>On the issue of limiting Soviet commercial expansion in the United States,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that he thought
                        this subject needed additional study. The President agreed but said that on
                        a case-by-case basis he would favor limiting Soviet commercial expansion.
                        However, he agreed that we need a detailed proposal.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of Soviet fishing in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        zones, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> was opposed
                        to suspending such fishing because we also benefitted from the fishing
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> thought that if we do
                        not do something in grain we should do something on fishing. The Secretary
                        of State said we could handle this through the allocation and not cancel the
                        agreement itself.</p>
                    <p><pb n="384" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_384"/>The President agreed that we should
                        not cancel the fishing agreement but tighten allocations. He said this
                        should be done irrespective of the decision to be taken on grain.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> cautioned that it would
                        depend on the type of fishing and on the agreement concerned. He said we
                        needed Soviet cooperation on salmon. The President responded that this
                        should be done on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> also pointed out that he
                        felt he should point out to the group that the power existed for the
                        President to freeze Soviet assets.</p>
                    <p>The Council then turned to the question of multilateral actions. The Council
                        approved the suggestion that we urge the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and France to increase broadcasts
                        to Muslim countries in Soviet Central Asia.</p>
                    <p>On the proposal to provide a daily circular to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and others in the status of the Soviet occupation of
                        Afghanistan, the President asked whether this could be done in coordination
                        with others. He also questioned whether we should do it daily but rather
                        periodically. He thought that the circulars should also go to all the media
                        and that we should coordinate with the BBC.</p>
                    <p>The group also confirmed that we should continue worldwide demarches urging
                        others to take actions complementing our unilateral initiatives.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the United Nations, the Secretary of State said that <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">Don McHenry</persName> was checking whether the
                        General Assembly has the jurisdiction for peace and security without
                        Security Council action or consideration. He said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> would call back shortly.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the issue of multilateral economic actions and the question of
                            <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> restraints, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we were prepared to
                        pursue the “Belgian formula” in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> and
                        this would involve liberalizing sensitive exports to China on a case-by-case
                        basis thereby creating a de facto differential. However, we would not
                        announce formally that <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> had created
                        such a differential. The President approved this approach.</p>
                    <p>On the question of consultations with others to reinforce <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> economic actions, the President said that
                        we should consult particularly on credits. That we should deny Soviet Union
                        credits and urge others to do the same. The Secretary of State pointed out
                        that we do not provide credits to the Soviet Union. The President responded
                        by saying we should nonetheless urge others not to provide further
                        credit.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> issue, the Vice
                        President suggested to the Secretary of Defense that he use the fact of the
                        China differential in the discussions with the Chinese next week. The
                        President asked <pb n="385" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_385"/>what the allied
                        reaction was to the concept of a China differential. Deputy Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said the reaction
                        was good. The Secretary of State said that on a case-by-case basis we would
                        look at China differently. The Secretary of Defense added that he would not
                        explain to China how we would do this but only the fact that we would do
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> summarized by saying
                        that we accept the idea of a differential in practice but do not establish a
                        public principle. Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> thought that the allies would be prepared to go
                        even further and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said
                        that this would be fine, but that he would proceed as indicated with the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>On the issue of increased economic assistance to countries in the region, it
                        was agreed that we should seek additional economic support for Pakistan. It
                        was also agreed that we will urge the international financial institutions
                        in countries with assistance programs to Afghanistan to terminate such
                        assistance. Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said that the allies will go along with
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Turning to arms control, it was noted that the arms control negotiations
                        should generally be left alone to proceed as they can. In particular, it was
                        agreed that <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> would go forward and that
                        the <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> ball was in the Soviet court. It
                        was also noted that <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> was moving ahead
                        but slowly and that the chemical warfare negotiations were in our
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of other concerned countries, the President asked
                        whether Yugoslavia would join us in protesting the Soviet action. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> pointed out that the
                        Yugoslavs had recently issued strong statements and that our embassy had
                        noted that they had acted with unprecedented speed in doing so.<note n="10" xml:id="d135fn10">The Yugoslav message denouncing the Soviet

                        they should have high on their list an offer to the Yugoslavs in the way of

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> asked about the legal
                        problem of providing aid to Pakistan. The President asked what the
                        impediments to our assistance to Pakistan are.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State explained that under the Symington Amendment we are
                        precluded from providing <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits to the
                        Pakistanis. He then proceeded to read the law. Thus he concluded we cannot
                        give money under the foreign assistance act.</p>
                    <p><pb n="386" facs="0431" xml:id="pg_386"/>The President said he thought
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had given us assurance that
                        he would not test nuclear weapons but that he could not bind his successor.
                        The Secretary of State replied that the Pakistanis have pulled back from
                        that commitment to saying only that they would not test a nuclear weapon in
                        the next six months and that was inadequate to provide the President a
                        waiver under the Symington Amendment. He said our choices were to either
                        change it to make it like the Glenn Amendment (changing and to or) but added
                        that if we take this approach we also confront the whole non-proliferation
                        issue head on.<note n="12" xml:id="d135fn12">See <ref target="#d99fn5">footnote 5, Document 99</ref>.</note> Another way under the
                        circumstances would be to have a special provision that simply said that
                        notwithstanding any other provision of law we will go ahead with assistance
                        to Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked what our treaty with Pakistan provided.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State then read it.<note n="13" xml:id="d135fn13">See <ref target="#d21fn6">footnote 6, Document 21</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that if we had a
                        one-time supplemental to provide <gloss target="#t_ESF_1">ESF</gloss> the
                        Congress might support the idea of the “notwithstanding and other provision
                        of law” approach. The Secretary of State then read such a proposed
                        amendment.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether this could be put on the appropriations bill. The
                        Secretary of State said yes or in the defense supplemental. The Secretary of
                        Defense noted that the latter would take a long time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> suggested that it could be put
                        through separately.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that we could consult with the Congress on the
                        best way to do it. Lloyd Culter noted that the provision should not be a
                        one-time lifting of the Symington Amendment but should be country specific.
                        The President noted that putting it in the foreign assistance bill might be
                        one way to get that bill out of committee.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State then [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] indicated that the Paks do not want to have any
                        mission to Pakistan until they see what the United States is prepared to do
                        in the way of commitments.<note n="14" xml:id="d135fn14">For an overview of

                        President noted this carefully and acknowledged that the Pakistanis want to
                        know first what we will do before committing themselves.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked that before
                        moving to a smaller meeting whether we should try to promulgate publicly the
                        decisions that have been reached in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting. The President and the Secretary of State said that they didn’t
                        believe that that could be done today. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> suggested that it would, however, be important
                        for the President to play a prominent role and to make a brief
                        statement.</p>
                    <p><pb n="387" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_387"/><persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Jody
                            Powell</persName> said that it depends on how we come out on the tough
                        issues of grain and the Olympics. The issues that had been decided thus far
                        will sound “mighty iffy.” He then reviewed the sum of them. He said that
                        restricting further and case-by-case limitations does not sound like much.
                        He personally was inclined to have the President play a role and go to the
                        people on this issue. He thought that the decision to provide additional
                        assistance to Pakistan and lift the Symington Amendment would be a high
                        profile item and would be an opportunity for newspapers to focus on it
                        today. He did not know how much we could do in substance but he thought we
                        should try to make a statement by tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President agreed that the list was not too impressive. He said the
                        addition of our decisions on Pakistan would help. He said that the grain
                        embargo would be a major step but he hoped that we would not do it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Jody Powell</persName> noted that we would
                        have to tighten up other trade or the farmers will say that big business
                        benefits and then we will have trouble politically.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that trying to curtail food is a loaded dynamite. If
                        the longshoremen go on strike, the Republicans will say we are so pro-union
                        that we will hurt the farmers in the midwest just to go along with the
                        unions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> asked whether the
                        government would have to buy the grain if we impose an embargo. The
                        President replied that <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Stu Eizenstat</persName>
                        was trying to find out the answer to that question. <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> said we might want a
                        legislative package to ease the burden on the farmers. In this connection,
                        the Vice President said that if the grain is in storage it is the same as if
                        it is on the market as far as the effect on price is concerned.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that if we go
                        forward with the grain embargo, we should try to make it a bipartisan effort
                        and get others to endorse it.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President thought the idea of the longshoremen taking foreign policy
                        into their own hands was outrageous. If we can talk them out of it before
                        they start it might work. But later there will be ego involved in the
                        embargo.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said it was a question
                        of sacrifice. We could introduce the sacrifices elsewhere. Such as gas
                        rationing or a plan for resuming the draft, which the Secretary favors. The
                        Vice President said that we had decided not to do things that hurt us. He
                        said that selling the grain was in our interest. It requires the Soviet
                        Union to spend hard currency. It helps the dollar in our balance of
                        payments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that if we cannot
                        do things that hurt us, we cannot get our allies to do things that hurt
                        them. <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Stu Eizenstat</persName> then joined the
                        meeting and explained what our obligations were under the <pb n="388" facs="0433" xml:id="pg_388"/>law. He said our obligation is not to use
                        the authority of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government to
                        interfere with the 8 million tons to which we are committed to sell the
                        Soviet Union under the agreement. The President asked what were our
                        obligations if there were a suit against the longshoremen. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> asked what were our
                        obligations in regard to the 13 million tons additional which we had
                        approved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName> said he did
                        not know. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that
                        there was no obligation not to interfere above the 8 million. That means
                        that there should be no control. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName> questioned that interpretation.</p>
                    <p>The President said we could wait until we hear from the allies before
                        deciding our own position of law. <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd
                            Cutler</persName> noted there are limits in our ability to control
                        food.</p>
                    <p>The President said that we ought to explore with our allies the possible
                        curtailment of both grain and industrial shipments. He asked that the Vice
                        President, <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Stu Eizenstat</persName> put together a
                        paper for him on this issue. The Vice President suggested that we might turn
                        down the Soviets on the 10 million tons that we were negotiating about
                            now.<note n="15" xml:id="d135fn15"><persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> a memorandum the next day, January 3, urging him
                            not to reduce grain sales to the Soviet Union, due to the beneficial
                            impact of the sales on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> economy.
                            The memorandum is printed in <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d253"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. VI, Soviet

                    <p>The President reiterated that he wanted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName> and the Vice President to get involved in
                        examining the legislation. He also wanted to explore the Congressional
                        leaders—their attitudes. He noted that Robert Dole will shoot at us either
                        way we decide.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> noted that we will also
                        need to consult on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> because others may
                        beat us to the punch. He was not sure that all of these items and in
                        particular <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> could be held for a few
                        days for a package announcement. The President hoped that we could make our
                        announcement within 24 hours. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that the allies would be able to respond in
                        that time. The President responded that the allies hope we will get out in
                        front and they will not be involved in it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we will be
                        ready to go tomorrow on the issues that had been decided. The question was
                        whether we defer the grain decision.</p>
                    <p>The President said we can decide on how to deliver the package later. The
                        Secretary of Defense said that without grain and the Olympics it won’t be
                        much of a package.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the allies are shipping grain to the Soviet
                        Union. The Secretary of State said yes the Canadians, the Austra<pb n="389" facs="0434" xml:id="pg_389"/>lians are shipping it and possibly the
                        Argentines. The President said, however, we are the only ones with corn. The
                        Vice President said there are 17 million tons of corn in the sales to the
                        Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName> said he
                        wished we might announce it after the Iowa caucuses.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName> said that the Soviet
                        reaction to this package of action should be assessed. The Secretary of
                        State said we have a list of possible Soviet reactions which we have
                        considered. The President asked that they be reviewed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName> asked whether it
                        included the possibility that the Soviets would terminate or curtail oil and
                        gas shipments to Western Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> noted that there was not all that much oil and gas
                        being shipped to Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that the worst thing would be if the Soviets went
                        ahead and tested 14 RVs on the SS–18 and did not abide by <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Soviets might do something on Berlin as a
                        signal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that
                        this would provide a big security confrontation he thought they would wish
                        to avoid. The President noted that the Federal Republic had been very
                        courageous on this issue.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked whether we had gone over the list of crucial imports
                        from the Soviet Union: chrome, platinum and so forth. He asked whether we
                        were still importing titanium. The President said no, that the Soviets were
                        not shipping titanium since they are now building titanium submarines.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Jody Powell</persName> asked what would be said
                        about this meeting. The President said the general line should be to say
                        that things are being considered; that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> is coming; that we are consulting
                        with our allies; and that an announcement might be made tomorrow.<note n="16" xml:id="d135fn16"><persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName>
                            read a statement at 5:04 p.m. that day, January 2, after the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting, outlining the President’s
                            decisions, including the recall of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>. See <hi rend="italic">Public

                    <p>The meeting was then restricted to the statutory members plus Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> reviewed the alternatives to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName>’s instructions in regard to
                        his China trip. He noted in particular that we had added the idea that we
                        would be prepared to provide China with an over-the-horizon radar.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that he had not heard of this issue until this
                        morning. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that
                        that was true of him as well. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that it was the Vice President’s idea which
                        had been staffed by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and which appeared
                        to be an extremely interesting one.</p>
                    <p><pb n="390" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_390"/>The Secretary of Defense said that
                        we could provide them with something to track and give them an indication of
                        specific actions by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that if we do this without Congressional
                        approval, we will have a very bad reaction. He said he was against it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense said that he does not need it in his instructions.
                        He felt he had a good package already. The fact that he is going and able to
                        assure the Chinese of our interests in their security and that we were
                        prepared to help the Pakistanis would be adequate.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said the Secretary of
                        State was correct in that heretofore we would not do something like this
                        either for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>S.R. or for China, but
                        that was before we had an invasion and we now have an increased sense of
                        vulnerability in Asia and China is an important deterrent to Soviet
                        activity.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked whether it was
                        in our interest to stand aside. He thought there was a difference between
                        offensive and defensive military equipment, and with Soviet tanks moving
                        towards the Indian Ocean, our unwillingness to provide anti-tank weapons was
                        not a contribution to regional stability.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that this is not a decision that the President
                        had to make now and that he should first consult with the Congress. The
                        President said that he did not have to consult <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Bob Byrd</persName>: that we should sell weapons to China, including
                        F–16’s.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> thought that the
                        public would not understand why we were unwilling to be helpful to the
                        Chinese in this kind of a situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that this issue did not have to be decided before
                        he left. He could raise the question of intelligence equipment and our
                        willingness to give them early warning capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he did not look upon over-the-horizon radar as
                        violating what we have said previously concerning providing arms to China.
                        He thought it was the sort of thing that should be explored. Our policy is
                        not to sell weapons. We approve of the ally sale of defensive arms.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State intervened to say that that was not precisely it. We
                        do not take the position of approving the sale of defensive arms. We simply
                        say that is our allies’ own concern.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the situation in Afghanistan and Iran does add a new
                        dimension. He thought that we should be prepared to modify our position but
                        how to modify it should be further explored. Something along the lines of
                        the over-the-horizon radar he thought should also be explored. In addition,
                        we ought to reexamine <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> and our
                        restrictions on sensitive equipment. The most important thing he concluded
                        is that we give a strong signal of support to the Chinese and of displeasure
                        to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p><pb n="391" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_391"/>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said, however, that we also need to
                        leave some room on the ladder of escalation, otherwise there is no need for
                        Soviet restraint. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        added that we do need to give enough of a signal so the Soviets know we are
                        serious.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said we are facing as
                        acute a dilemma as when the British came to us to say that Greece and Turkey
                        were our problem.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was not sure that what we had decided today will
                        deter the Soviets from going into Pakistan and into Iran. Both the Secretary
                        of State and the Secretary of Defense agreed that it would not, but that it
                        would provide a signal. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that our response must make the Soviets wonder
                        whether the next step will be worth it.</p>
                    <p>Turning back to China, the President said that the basic memo from <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName> on his instructions for China
                        was good.<note n="17" xml:id="d135fn17">See <ref target="frus1977-80v13#d286"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,

                        Secretary of State agreed.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that before Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> leaves, he would like to sit down and review his
                        instructions. He suggested that this be done at the Friday breakfast in
                        order to confirm the Secretary’s instructions. The Secretary of State noted
                        that there were two other items suggested to be added to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>’s list and two others that he could
                        not agree with. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>’s instructions
                        were generally agreed among the three of them along the lines indicated by
                        the Secretary of State. He summarized by saying that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>’s memo was generally acceptable, but
                        that the final signoff would await the Friday breakfast. The President
                        agreed. He said that we should continue to explore what further might be
                        done for the Chinese.<note n="18" xml:id="d135fn18">The President approved
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>’s memorandum, as well

                    <p>He then commented that since discussing the issue of the kinds of signals
                        that need to be sent to the Soviet Union in this crisis, he was inclined to
                        go ahead on a grain embargo in order to give the Soviets a signal on their
                        behavior. The President asked that there be a further discussion of the
                        grain issue tomorrow morning. He said that we need to get broad-based
                        support for a grain embargo which is what he was inclined to go with at this
                        stage.</p>

                        to publicize the Soviet role in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>7) Our posture toward the Afghan Government will be not to conduct any formal
                        business for the time being. The number of American personnel at the Embassy
                        will be reduced to ten. The question of recognition of the Babrak regime
                        does not arise.</p>
                    <p>8) The Consular Review Talks which are now in a state of suspension will not
                        be resumed.</p>
                    <p>9) On a case-by-case basis, The Department of State will reject and delay
                        visas for official visits to the United States.</p>
                    <p>10) Soviet media representation in the United States will be reduced to the
                        same level as <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> media representation in
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>11) Shipment by C5A aircraft of the MHD channel will be deferred
                        indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>12) Negotiations with the Soviet Union on the General Exchange Agreement will
                        not be resumed.</p>
                    <p>13) We will cancel the following:</p>

                        11–18.</p></quote>
                    <p>14) Any meetings at the level of Assistant Secretary or above will be
                        reviewed on a case-by-case basis with the presumption that they will be
                        cancelled unless there are overriding reasons not to do so.</p>
                    <p>15) On the Olympics, we will take the following position which may be used
                        publicly: “Our European Allies have questioned whether we should proceed to
                        participate in the Olympic games in Moscow. We will assess this question and
                        review the position taken by other countries in reaching our decision.”</p>
                    <p>16) <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> travel controls on Soviet officials
                        and the enforcement of these controls will be reviewed to ensure greater
                        reciprocity with the treatment accorded our officials in the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p><pb n="394" facs="0439" xml:id="pg_394"/>17) We should postpone the following
                        meetings: the Joint Commercial Committee Meeting scheduled for April 14–15
                        in Washington; the Business Facilitation Talks scheduled for January 9 in
                        Moscow; and the Civil Aviation Talks scheduled for February 13. In addition,
                        Aeroflot’s scheduled service will be limited to the two weekly flights
                        currently authorized.</p>
                    <p>18) The United States export controls on exports to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will be tightened up on a case-by-case
                        basis. The United States should be prepared to restrict export licenses to
                        an even greater degree than our allies if it does not disadvantage <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> business in comparison with our
                            allies.<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">A <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> intelligence assessment, FR 80–10037, January 1980,

                    <p>19) There should be an examination of Soviet commercial expansion in the
                        United States with a view to restricting it. The Department of State should
                        forward proposals to this effect within one week.</p>
                    <p>20) Allocations to the Soviet Union under our Fishing Agreements should be
                        restricted.</p>
                    <p>21) The United States should continue to urge our allies to increase
                        broadcasts to Muslim countries and Soviet Central Asia on developments in
                        Afghanistan. There should also be prepared in conjunction with our allies a
                        periodic circular to be distributed at the United Nations on the status of
                        the Soviet invasion and occupation in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>22) The United States will join in a letter to the President of the Security
                        Council urging that the Afghanistan situation be placed on the agenda.
                        Unless it would be a violation of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Charter, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> will be
                        instructed to tell other nations that it is our preference to also raise
                        this issue at the current General Assembly.<note n="6" xml:id="d136fn6">At
                            the request of 52 states, including the United States, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council convened January 5–9
                            but, due to a Soviet veto, failed to adopt a resolution calling for the
                            withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. An emergency special
                            session of the General Assembly held January 10–14 adopted Resolution
                            ES–6/2 denouncing foreign armed intervention in Afghanistan. See <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations, 1980</hi>, pp.

                    <p>23) We will proceed on a case-by-case basis to implement the “Belgian
                        Formula” for creating a de facto differential in <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> favoring China in comparison to the Soviet Union. There
                        will be no public statement of this policy.</p>
                    <p>24) We will consult with other countries to urge them to deny the Soviet
                        Union further credit.</p>
                    <p>25) We will work with our allies to urge the <gloss target="#t_IFI_1">IFI</gloss>’s and countries with assistance programs to Afghanistan to
                        terminate such assistance.</p>
                    <p><pb n="395" facs="0440" xml:id="pg_395"/>26) We will seek an amendment in the

                    <p>The Department of State should immediately inform our allies of our intention

                    </list>
                    <p>The events in Afghanistan are a major historical turning point. The Soviet
                        invasion measurably raises the chances of US armed involvement in an
                        entirely new region of the world. At one stroke, the chances of such
                        involvement have now become far greater in Southwest Asia than they are, for
                        example, in Korea, another possible flashpoint. In this regard we should
                        firmly keep in mind that the two wars we have fought since the Second World
                        War, both of them against Communist nations advised by the Kremlin, resulted
                        from fundamental miscalculations by the other side as to our intentions.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>—North Korea would not have attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, if
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADG_1">Acheson</persName> had not specifically
                        placed Korea outside the US <pb n="396" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_396"/>defense
                        perimeter and thereby reinforced the Kremlin’s belief that we would not
                        become directly involved on the Korean Peninsula. (S)</p>
                    <p>—The North Vietnamese would not have introduced the 320th and 324th divisions
                        into South Vietnam during the fall of 1964 if they had anticipated a US
                        introduction of 500,000 American troops to meet the challenge. It should not
                        be lost sight of that in the autumn of 1964 we were engaged in a political
                        campaign during which Johnson was tarring Goldwater as a warmonger and was
                        stating repeatedly that American soldiers would not be involved in a land
                        war in Asia. The Vietnamese took Johnson at his word—unfortunately. (S)</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan points like a dagger at both Iran and Pakistan. Nobody at this
                        point can predict with certitude that the United States would not at some
                        future point get drawn into a war which involved either country. (S)</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the Soviets and their Afghan puppets are going to be extremely
                        unpopular in Afghanistan for years to come. They will consequently be
                        looking for a means to consolidate the regime and increase the popularity of
                        Babrak or his successors. One way of doing this, which will certainly occur
                        to them, is the promotion of Afghan national aspirations vis-a-vis both
                        Pakistan and Iran. The impetus to the Kremlin for adopting a high-risk
                        policy will be very great. (S)</p>
                    <p>The challenge to the United States by the Soviet invasion is a long-range
                        one. It will be something which we will be facing over at least the next
                        decade. It is essential in dealing with this challenge, that we think of it
                        in global terms. We should respond to it by:</p>
                    <p>a. increasing defense cooperation with the Chinese up to, and including,
                        supply of defensive weapons, training, and intelligence exchanges;</p>
                    <p>b. making life as difficult as we can for the Soviets and their Cuban and
                        Vietnamese surrogates in such places as Angola, Ethiopia, and Cambodia;</p>

                    <p>f. establishing a firm security commitment to the Pakistanis;</p>

                    <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>] discussed the Soviet
                        invasion of Afghanistan. During the conversation he referred vaguely to the
                        number of Soviet divisions involved, but when pressed on the number, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] stated that the
                        exact number of troops is not now important because the Soviets will use
                        whatever force is necessary to crush the resistance and establish complete
                        control. According to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] the Soviet forces will then withdraw. (Source
                        comment: [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] gave the
                        impression that this will be done quickly, and will not involve protracted
                        military involvement.)</p>
                    <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] wished to
                        discuss the possible political and economic losses to the Soviet Union as a
                        result of the invasion. He responded to comments on possible economic
                        reprisals by saying the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is not
                        concerned about the possibility of trade sanctions nor of a grain embargo.
                        He stated that there are people in the Soviet Union who feel a return to the
                        Cold War is better for the Soviet Union in the long run and Western economic
                        pressures will strengthen that group. He said that some people in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> feel détente was a mistake and the
                        invasion was a decisive way to end détente. He pointed to the failure of the
                        efforts to halt the arms race, which had led to more defense spending
                        instead of less. He noted that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had
                        refused to work with the Soviets on any level and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had boxed in the Soviets. (Source comment:
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] never stated
                        which people felt boxed in, nor which people wished to end détente.)</p>
                    <p><pb n="399" facs="0444" xml:id="pg_399"/>3. He said there are some people in
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> who wish to act the role of a
                        super power, which means to be “unpunishable”. According to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the Afganistan
                        invasion is allowing that group in the Soviet leadership to prove to the
                        world that the Soviet Union is now truly a super power as the West is
                        powerless to interfere.</p>
                    <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] stated he hoped
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would recognize the new government
                        and work with it, as the new government would bring stability to the
                        region.</p>

                    <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] from 1963–1965.
                        Those were the years we started increasing our support to the Meo tribesmen
                        loyal to Vang Pao.<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Major General Vang Pao, Royal
                            Lao Army, was the leader of the Hmong (Meo) forces in Laos and
                            Vietnam.</note> Better armed, the Meo did increase their harassment of
                        the Viet Cong. The increase in activities brought more casualties. We were
                        able to justify the loss of life on the basis that we were contributing to
                        the efforts of our allies in Vietnam. By 1975 several generations of Meo
                        tribesmen in Laos were dead and a substantial part of the tribe had to go
                        into exile.</p>
                    <p>2. I do not believe any responsible person in the Intelligence Community
                        believes the Afghan guerrillas can oust the Soviets from Afghanistan or even
                        make their stay in the country untenable. At the most the guerrillas will
                        serve as pin pricks in an elephant’s hide. The repercussions for them,
                        however, are probably going to be fierce. Providing them more arms will
                        merely increase the number of casualties the guerrillas will suffer. Can we
                        justify this to ourselves?</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is the first time since 1945 that the
                        Soviet Union used its military forces directly to expand its power. This
                        took place even though we warned the Soviet Union of adverse consequences.
                        Moreover, Afghanistan is the seventh state since 1975 in which communist
                        parties have come to power with Soviet guns and tanks, with Soviet military
                        power and assistance (Vietnam, Angola, Laos, South Yemen, Cambodia,
                        Ethiopia, and now probably Afghanistan). Four of these takeovers occurred
                        since January 1977.</p>
                    <p>I think it is clear that the Soviets have discounted our likely reaction and
                        that they have concluded that our previous expressions of concern need not
                        be heeded. In effect, because we did not overreact to their previous acts of
                        assertiveness, they have discounted the likelihood of a genuinely punitive
                        reaction on our part to this extraordinary application of Soviet military
                        power.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the foregoing, I would like to urge you to consider altering
                        our formula on arms for China from “we will not sell arms to China” to “we
                        will not sell offensive arms to China.” This shift in formulation would
                        enable you to provide the Chinese with the over-the-horizon radar and
                        perhaps later with anti-tank weaponry. Given the scale and the boldness of
                        the Soviet move, these reactions are both needed and hardly excessive.
                        Moreover, they would communicate tangibly our willingness to support those
                        who are prepared to stand up to the Soviets, and the Chinese are certainly
                        in that category.</p>
                    <p>More broadly, we have to move deliberately to fashion a wider security
                        arrangement for the region, lest Soviet influence spread rapidly from
                        Afghanistan to Pakistan and Iran. I cannot emphasize strongly enough the
                        strategic consequences of such a development. It would place in direct
                        jeopardy our most vital interests in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p><pb n="401" facs="0446" xml:id="pg_401"/>The recommended subtle change in
                        terminology, initiating a limited defense arrangement with China, could be
                        the point of departure for a wider security effort in the region. You are
                        already moving firmly on Pakistan, and I believe the Congress will support
                        you. We should implement rapidly your decisions on new bases in the Indian
                        Ocean/Gulf of Oman area, and survey teams will now be going out.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the above, we will need an aid package for Pakistan, and that could be
                        expensive, though it might be shared with Saudi Arabia. Also, if we can
                        stiffen Pakistan’s back, we should be in a position to extend some aid to
                        the Afghani rebels, in order to keep the Soviets bogged down.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we need to do something to reassure the Egyptians, the Saudis, and
                        others on the Arabian peninsula that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is prepared to assert its power, and that requires a
                        visible military presence in the area now. You might consider consulting
                        with Sadat about military deployment to an Egyptian base of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> brigade for joint maneuvers. This would be
                        an impressive demonstration of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        determination to contest, if necessary, Soviet military preeminence in the
                        region.</p>
                    <p>The above recommendations require major decisions by you, but I believe that
                        a major historical turning point has been reached. You have the opportunity
                        to do what President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> did on
                        Greece and Turkey, and I believe that this is desirable both for domestic
                        and international reasons.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">See <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>.</note> The country will respond
                        to a firm call for measured but also sustained action, and I am sure the
                        Congressional leadership will support you.</p>
                    <p>I would recommend that you raise the above issues at the breakfast, and
                        provide Harold with whatever guidance you think is appropriate for his
                            trip.<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">No record was found of the January 4

                            consultations in London. See <ref target="#d107fn2">footnote 2, Document

                    <p>Summary</p>
                    <p>At the personal request of the Deputy Secretary, <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">George
                            Vest</persName> and <gloss target="#t_EA_1">EA</gloss> Assistant
                        Secretary Dick Holbrooke called in Chinese Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai Zemin</persName> Jan 3 afternoon for a detailed
                        briefing on the results of our consultations with our allies on actions to
                        be taken in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> outlined options for actions
                        affecting <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations currently being considered by the President.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> and Holbrooke stressed that
                        we consider this meeting only the beginning of a process by which we will
                        keep the Chinese closely informed of our actions, and said that <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName> would be prepared to go
                        into even greater detail during his visit to Beijing.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">See <ref target="#d149">Documents 149</ref> and <ref target="#d150">150</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> condemned the Soviet Union’s
                        “naked aggression” in stronger language and with more emotion than we have
                        heard him use before. He emphasized: the urgent need to awaken Third World
                        and non-aligned countries to the dangers of close relationships with the
                        Soviets; stressed the essentiality of a campaign to mobilize world opinion
                        to condemn Soviet aggression against Afghanistan; and underscored the
                        importance of taking concrete steps to strengthen Afghanistan’s neighbors.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> also expressed the hope that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would not do anything vis-à-vis
                        Iran that might detract from world attention to the gravity of the
                        Afghanistan situation. He said that the Chinese were consulting closely with
                        Pakistan on efforts by Islamabad to persuade Iran to release the American
                        hostages as soon as possible, so as to lower <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iran tensions and deprive the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> of a possible target of opportunity. End summary.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> opened the meeting with an
                        exposition of the information on the Deputy Secretary’s consultations with
                        his British, French, Italian, German and Canadian counterparts at London
                        contained <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>
                        <pb n="403" facs="0448" xml:id="pg_403"/>(repeated to Beijing Jan. 3). He
                        also gave <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> a copy of the joint
                        statement to the press issued at the meeting’s conclusion.<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">See <ref target="#d107fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                107</ref>, and <ref target="#d141fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above.
                            According to telegram 8988 from <gloss target="#t_USNATO_1">USNATO</gloss>, the joint statement was “rather bland at French
                            insistence.” The text of the statement and <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s remarks to the press was transmitted in
                            telegram 25696 from London, December 31, 1979. (National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D800004–0385)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> stressed that all present had
                        agreed that the Soviet actions in Afghanistan could not be regarded as a
                        localized incident, and that they had serious implications for the interests
                        of each country. As such, they justified both special efforts to assist
                        countries on the perimeter of Afghanistan and adjustments in bilateral
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to bring home to
                        the Soviets the penalties that must attach to such conduct and to deter
                        further Soviet military adventurism. This sense of urgency, coupled with
                        resolve to display displeasure in bilateral relationships with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and to maintain and enhance our common
                        defense capabilities had been even more greatly in evidence at the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Council meeting held in Brussels on New
                        Year’s Day. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> noted that eight of
                        the Ambassadors out of fifteen had cut short vacations to return to Brussels
                        for this important discussion, rather than leave the matter to their
                        Chargés. At both the London and Brussels meetings there had been a sense
                        that the long term behavior of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        would be decisively affected by a serious response to the immediate problem
                        of the events in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> said that at the London
                        meeting, after an initial exchange of intelligence on the Afghan situation,
                        the participants had moved quickly to the conclusion that none of their
                        Missions at Kabul should maintain political contact of any kind with the new
                        puppet regime. There was a consensus that the new regime was a puppet
                        government, without any claim to legitimacy. The Italians had already
                        withdrawn their Ambassador for consultations; the Germans planned to do so.
                        Both would reduce the size of their Missions at Kabul. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,
                        Canada and Italy were considering reducing or freezing all bilateral aid
                        activities; the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> and Canada were
                        reevaluating aid to Afghanistan through multilateral agencies as well. At
                        the same time, there was much discussion of the implications of the events
                        in Afghanistan for Pakistan, and the participants considered now to
                        coordinate their respective economic and security programs to reassure
                        Pakistan in face of the highly destabilizing situation in its neighboring
                        states.</p>
                    <p>4. With respect to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, all
                        participants agreed on the need for strong public condemnation. (All had in
                        fact already issued statements of condemnation, which were exchanged.) All
                        considered it important to encourage attention to and condemnation of the
                        Soviet <pb n="404" facs="0449" xml:id="pg_404"/>aggression by other
                        countries, especially Islamic, non-aligned and Third World nations. This
                        would be especially important in bringing the matter before the United
                        Nations, which all agreed should be done urgently, whether before the
                        Security Council or General Assembly. All agreed on the importance of
                        informing China of their deliberations; and actions; and, <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> said, he was pleased to be able to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> said that a wide range of
                        actions in each country’s relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had been thrown out for discussion. In no particular order
                        of priority or sequence of implementation, these included:</p>
                    <p>—cancelling all high level visits of political or military significance;</p>
                    <p>—cancelling many of the extensive social and cultural activities that have
                        become extensive in West European relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>;</p>
                    <p>—increasing the level of restrictions on trade of certain items, especially
                        those embodying advanced technology;</p>
                    <p>—reconsidering the extension or renewal of credit arrangements (a common
                        element of WE-<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> relations);</p>
                    <p>—considering cancelling or restricting grain sales, or limiting them to
                        certain levels (a matter primarily concerning the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>No firm decisions had been made. Rather each country would consider what it
                        could and should do, and continue the process of consultation. Détente
                        activities between Western and Eastern Europe were being revised and the
                        general feeling was to go slow on these, while not cancelling them.
                            (<persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> cited the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Review Conference at Madrid as an
                        example.) The <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision on
                        modernization of theater nuclear forces of December had been confirmed, as
                        had the firm intention of all to maintain and build-up military forces in
                        the European area.</p>
                    <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had taken these consultations
                        into account in developing its own actions, said <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName>. He noted that Afghanistan had
                        already been brought to the United Nations, while our Ambassador to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> had been recalled for consultations. The President
                        has asked for delay in consideration of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty on the Senate floor in light of the Afghan
                        situation so that he and the Congress could further assess Soviet actions
                        and intentions. The treaty had not, however been withdrawn. As decided by
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting in December,
                        we would go forward with plans to modernize theater nuclear forces in
                        Europe, while continuing to make preparations for the arms control
                        discussions that were integral to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        decision. Holbrooke added that <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> would brief the Chinese in
                        detail on this <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> said he wished to outline a
                        series of actions now being considered by the President on which decisions
                        might be made as early as Jan. 4, these included (again in no particular
                        order):</p>
                    <p><pb n="405" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_405"/>[Omitted here is a list of specific
                        actions; see <ref target="#d136">Document 136</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>8. Some marginal mention had also been made of cancelling participation in
                        the Olympic Games. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> personally
                        believed that for sound reasons this, which he wished to mention only
                        because of the wide press attention the idea had received, was most unlikely
                        to come about.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> pointed out that food imports
                        were crucial to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, which imports 20
                        million tons of grain per year from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        He asked whether we would be able to reduce this amount or cancel existing
                        contracts? <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> replied that this
                        was something at which we were looking but pointed to the need for agreement
                        of other grain exporters, such as Canada, France, Australia and Argentina.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> agreed the matter was very
                        complicated.</p>
                    <p>10. In summary, <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> and Holbrooke
                        emphasized the attention that Afghanistan was receiving from the very
                        highest officials of West European governments, and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> desire to keep China informed of these
                        deliberations and their results. <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> would wish to continue the
                        discussion and exchange of views begun with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> in this meeting.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> and Holbrooke for the detailed
                        briefing and expressed appreciation for the efforts Western countries were
                        considering taking to boycott the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        The Soviet Union’s naked aggression in Afghanistan needed to receive the
                        very strongest condemnation from all countries, he said. What had happened
                        in Afghanistan was part of a pattern of repeated aggression carried out
                        directly or indirectly by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> through
                        mercenaries or subversion. If this pattern of behavior is not condemned and
                        halted now, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would continue it and
                        do to other countries what it had done to Afghanistan. “The world will then
                        know no peace.” <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> said that
                        unfortunately there were still some countries who looked on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as a “benefactor, their best friend” and
                        a “natural ally” and had not yet seen the true features of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, which was an aggressor nation with
                        hegemonic ambitions. Instead of condemning the Soviets “criminal acts of
                        suppression” in Afghanistan, they tried to whitewash them. Some countries
                        still rested their hopes for peace and security on the signing of “peace and
                        friendship treaties in exchange for Soviet protection.” Some still place
                        their hopes of preventing Soviet expansionism in the maintenance of friendly
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the pursuit of
                        détente. The Soviet invasion of a sovereign neighboring state shows its true
                        features. Such behavior could never be justified. No one could possibly
                        imagine that a small country such as Afghanistan (that had had rather close
                        relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> after Daoud’s coup
                        d’état) could possibly threaten Soviet security. But, not content with what
                        was after all a rather favorable position in Afghanistan, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had instigated coup after coup to bring
                        the country fully within its control. Afghanistan <pb n="406" facs="0451" xml:id="pg_406"/>had signed a peace and friendship treaty in hopes of
                        securing peaceful relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                        It had been surprised when the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        nevertheless invaded it and began carrying out its massacres of the Afghan
                        population.</p>
                    <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> said that he agreed
                        completely with <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> on the need to
                        mobilize world opinion to condemn the Soviet action as much as possible, to
                        discredit the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and to cause all to
                        recognize that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was no one’s
                        natural ally but rather an international gangster; not peace loving but
                        hegemonist and expansionist. It was of equal importance to drive home the
                        point that signing peace and friendship treaties did not bring the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to treat the signatory state in a
                        friendly way. Rather, to do so was similar to “going to bed with a tiger or
                        a wolf” and to run a constant risk of being swallowed.</p>
                    <p>13. Beyond this, however, <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> said it
                        was important to mobilize all countries to take measures to boycott the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. And it was vitally important to
                        support the nations around Afghanistan and to reinforce their confidence.
                        For its part, China was taking appropriate measures. It had issued a strong
                        statement of condemnation and Chinese newspapers and publications were
                        keeping up a steady barrage of criticism. China was consulting with
                        Afghanistan’s neighbors, with the non-aligned and with the members of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> on a worldwide campaign to alert the
                        world to the Soviets southward drive to the Indian Ocean. The Soviet
                        objective was to encircle the Middle East and eventually Europe. <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> agreed with Holbrooke that the Afghan
                        situation and its implications would be a principal issue for discussion
                        during <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>’s visit to Beijing. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName>’s analysis and comments on the meaning
                        of the Soviet move into Afghanistan were almost identical with ours and
                        those of the five other countries at the London meeting. All were in
                        agreement that what we did now would decisively influence the rapidity with
                        which the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would move on to its longer
                        range goals of encirclement, and reaching the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> said that some Third World
                        countries and members of the Non-Aligned Movement depended on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for money and foreign aid and so “toed
                        the Soviet line,” but that Afghan developments will make them see part of
                        the truth. China believed therefore that while the invasion of Afghanistan
                        was a bad thing, it would also have some positive effects. By this act, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has “exposed itself” for all to
                        see, and become, in Chairman Mao’s words, a “teacher by negative
                        example.”</p>
                    <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> said that, as he had stressed
                        to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> at dinner the
                        previous evening, he hoped the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would
                        continue to adjust its policies toward Pakistan and Turkey in order to
                        strengthen, support and assist them, boost their confidence and their
                        capability for resistance. He said the Iranian situation warranted special
                        attention in this <pb n="407" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_407"/>context. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> sought to take advantage of the
                        turmoil in Iran. Should that country fall into Soviet hands, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s drive to the south and push to the
                        Indian Ocean would have succeeded. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> commented that we hoped that Iran’s leaders would now
                        realize who their main enemy was and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was not their enemy. We hoped a gradual restoration of
                        dialog might take place as a result of what the Soviets had done in
                        Afghanistan. But, he stressed it was important that other countries remind
                        Iran of the perils of having the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        rather than the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> as a neighbor.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> said that China was
                        consulting closely with Pakistan in the hope that Pakistan could work on
                        Iran to release its American hostages as soon as possible. He expressed the
                        hope that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations with Iran would not
                        be made “too tense” and that current tensions would, in fact, ease. It was
                        important that nothing be done to distract world attention from the gravity
                        of the Afghan situation. China hoped that Iran’s attention could be diverted
                        to Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>16. In closing, <persName corresp="#p_CZ_1">Chai</persName> stressed that
                        what had occurred in Afghanistan was of major strategic importance. It could
                        not be regarded as a localized incident. He hoped the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China could cooperate effectively on
                        this issue. <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> responded that we
                        would stay in close contact. Holbrooke added that Sec Def <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> would have additional information on
                        what the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China should consider
                        doing to achieve our mutual objectives in this matter, which he would be
                        discussing in detail with China’s leaders in Beijing the following week.</p>

                    <p>65. Subject: (U) Afghanistan, Pakistan, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and the United States.</p>
                    <p>1. (C) Summary: The Soviet rape of Afghanistan during the last week of
                        December 1979 has qualitatively changed the geo-political situation in South
                        Asia. It has made Pakistan’s worst-case analysis come true and produced a
                        profound sense of unease in a nation already wanting in sense of purpose and
                        security. Differences in perceptions in South Asia, fanned by reports of
                        outside military aid for Pakistan, may exacerbate relations between India
                        and Pakistan as well.</p>
                    <p>2. (C) South Asia can be a fertile area through which to channel our regional
                        response to the Soviet grab; Pakistan, in particular, needs help, and if it
                        is perceived to be adequate, to be funded, and to be carefully
                        orchestrated—with full consultations—such help as we may provide should be
                        welcome here. But the regional and world situation is much more complicated
                        than the environment in which the 1959 bilateral agreement was formulated,
                        and we can be sure that actions meant to reassure Pakistan are in fact
                        reassuring in Islamabad (and salutary in Kabul and Moscow) only if we
                        consult closely, fully, and continuously with Pakistan. Beyond South Asia,
                        the Soviet actions in Afghanistan pose a critical juncture in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations, and it is in arenas
                        other than South Asia that the main <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        response should be registered. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. (U) Background: During all of the last century of the British Raj in South
                        Asia, a dominant theme in British geo-political policy was to make safe the
                        Empire’s Indian realm by ensuring that at no time was a power inimical to
                        British interests permitted to determine the destinies of the Kingdom of
                        Kabul at the head of the best land route into South Asia from the west and
                        north. As Czarist Russian influence filled out the vast Central Asian
                        reaches—epitomized by sweeps of swashbuckling Cossacks—the British fought
                        numerous small and several major campaigns in the harsh topography of
                        Afghanistan to underline their determination. In 1880, the issues were
                        significant enough to play a role in the return to power in England of
                        Gladstone.</p>
                    <p><pb n="409" facs="0454" xml:id="pg_409"/>4. (U) The British aim was to keep
                        Afghanistan a buffer, in the classic sense, and so it remained through the
                        end of April 1978 when a Communist-led, armed forces-mounted coup d’état in
                        Kabul swept aside the traditional power structure and imposed, for the first
                        time, a government subservient to the rulers of Moscow. The buffer was gone,
                        and the heirs to the British Raj in South Asia—Pakistan in particular, India
                        slightly removed—reflected in varying ways their concern over its
                        demise.</p>
                    <p>5. (C) Still there was hope that Afghan nationalism would temper the Marxism
                        of the new Afghan rulers. The growing strength of a home-grown Afghan
                        insurgency against the rulers of Kabul gave hope that in the short run those
                        rulers would be too preoccupied to meddle farther afield, while in the long
                        run they might even be replaced.</p>
                    <p>6. (U) All of that has changed with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on
                        25–27 December and the subsequent installation in Kabul of a puppet
                        government whose power rests exclusively on gun barrels of Soviet armor—the
                        latter-day Cossacks. For Afghanistan, and for the nations of South Asia
                        generally, the Cossacks have finally arrived, and nothing will ever be the
                        same again.</p>
                    <p>7. (C) Implications: For Pakistan, Soviet actions at end of December 1979 are
                        a worst-case analysis come true. Much has been written, in official and
                        academic circles, about Pakistan’s inherent sense of insecurity and
                        inferiority. Born of a negative—a desire to carve out an area for Muslims to
                        live their lives free of Hindu dominance—Pakistan has been dominated by the
                        quest through the 32 years of its existence to preserve its independence
                        through the manipulation of outside forces.</p>
                    <p>8. (C) Pakistan has successively chosen patrons in hopes of creating a
                        constituency outside South Asia which would remain interested in and
                        committed to Pakistan’s integrity and independence. The relationship with
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, dating back to 1954, had the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as its focus; this remains the
                        core of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan relationship
                        despite the disappointments of the Pakistan side about <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> “failure” to defend Pakistan against
                        India. The post-1962 Pakistani relationship with China had India, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> as its focus; it remains a shared <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Chinese perception vis-à-vis both India and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and has weathered successfully the
                        transformation of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Chinese
                        relationship from hostility to friendship.</p>
                    <p>9. (C) Later Pakistani fascination with the Islamic and non-aligned worlds
                        reflects both a further effort to diversify support for Pakistan from beyond
                        its borders and a distrust of a seemingly unreliable <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. Playing a role on the international
                        Islamic stage gave <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName>—during a
                        period of national reconstruction following the 1971 Bangladesh debacle—an
                        opportunity to court Arab and Persian oil money as a way of compensating for
                        the decline in American assistance levels. The end <pb n="410" facs="0455" xml:id="pg_410"/>of the Nehru-Nasser relationship enabled Pakistan to
                        crack through India’s long blockage of Pakistani efforts to use its Islamic
                        heritage to forge bonds with the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>10. (C) The decline into irrelevance, and finally collapse, of <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> in 1979 enabled Pakistan to shed the
                        only substantial block against its entry into the Non-Aligned Movement
                            (<gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>), a Third World forum valuable in
                        Pakistan eyes, however lame (and pro-Communist) its recent deliberations in
                        comparison with the great <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> days of the
                        early 1960s. A determined multilateralist, with a strong anti-Western bent,
                        Foreign Advisor <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> has given
                        these multilateral impulses renewed vitality during the present martial law
                        government’s 30 months at the helm, adopting for himself the international
                        role—albeit diminished—that <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName>
                        had sought and expanding Pakistan’s influence in the Group of 77, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, the Islamic Conference, and the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>11. (C) Pakistan’s role in the non-proliferation field since the explosion of
                        an Indian device ended South Asia’s nuclear virginity in 1974 has also been
                        an important element of its quest for security. This has featured regular
                        promotion of a South Asia nuclear free zone—opposed by India but supported
                        by a growing number of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members, including
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> In later years, it has also
                        included a decision to develop Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities to the
                        threshold of a nuclear device—and consequent nuclear parity with India—as an
                        additional pressure on India to come to terms on a nuclear-free regime for
                        the region. This last has brought Pakistan directly into conflict with
                        American non-proliferation objectives, straining the Pakistan-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> tie and depriving Pakistan of most <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance.</p>
                    <p>12. (C) Pakistani isolation and weakness: As Pakistan enters the 1980s, it
                        feels weak, threatened, and isolated, notwithstanding its persistent efforts
                        to enhance its security. Its patrons appear unreliable or stretched to their
                        maximum utility. The United States seems less interested in playing a role
                        in the region than it once did, and its energies seem sapped by a failure of
                        consensus within, by its non-proliferation concerns, and by the Iranian
                        distraction. The prospect of an <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira
                            Gandhi</persName> government or alternatively continued instability in
                        India is worrying. Whatever comfort <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>
                        may derive from solidarity with the Iranian revolution, the Ayatollah is no
                        substitute for a strong and friendly Shahinshah in Tehran. And to the north,
                        the Russian bear gets nastier, more aggressive, and less restrained. In
                        Islamabad, meanwhile, the Soviet Embassy seems bent on a new activist
                        campaign to sow dissent and discord.</p>
                    <p>13. (C) Domestically, Pakistan’s political fabric is fragile, having once
                        again backed away from popular elections which, without <gloss target="#t_PPP_1">PPP</gloss> participation, would doubtless have
                        produced Janata-like instability in the classic Pakistan pattern. The
                        country has failed to evolve a viable <pb n="411" facs="0456" xml:id="pg_411"/>compact for the self-government of its disparate and
                        dissimilar regions. And despite a renewed commitment by this leadership to
                        the language and spirit of traditional Islam, it has failed to evolve a
                        national ethic to transform the negativism of its founding impulse into a
                        viable and enduring nationalism in positive terms.</p>
                    <p>14. (C) All of this is made worse by the knowledge that Pakistan’s Armed
                        Forces are not what they ought to be. Weakened by obsolescence and financial
                        constraints, haunted by a losing record on the battlefield, and distracted
                        from its military pursuits by its direct involvement in running the country
                        for nearly half its 32 years, the Pakistan Armed Forces have lost
                        considerable effectiveness. They march smartly but appear increasingly
                        afflicted with inefficiency in performing their military duties. While it
                        would be perhaps dangerous to over-generalize, the American Mission’s
                        experience on 21 Nov. in awaiting ‘rescue’ by a Pakistan Army whose ability
                        to move and to communicate any more efficiently than Napoleon’s is
                        instructive, and worrying.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">See <ref target="#d102fn10">footnote 10, Document 102</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>15. (C) A further complication for Pakistan in even responding to likely
                        Western offers of assistance and support is the variegated nature of the
                        interests Pakistan pursues abroad in search of security. Asked on 31 Dec. by
                        a Western journalist how best the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could
                        help Pakistan in the present time, <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName> unhesitatingly replied, “settle its differences with
                        Iran.” This would uncomplicate the situation for Pakistan. On the one hand,
                        Pakistan doubtless welcomes the possible new Western embrace events in Kabul
                        may produce; on the other, it finds the prospect of too public an embrace
                        embarrassing and counter to its pursuit of acceptability and support in and
                        from other quarters and sources. Some indeed fear such an embrace will
                        increase Soviet bellicosity.</p>
                    <p>16. (C) Pakistan’s options are limited, however, all talk of accommodation
                        with the Soviet Union notwithstanding. Only the United States, and to a
                        lesser degree, China can provide the hardware Pakistan needs and the
                        international support it yearns for at the present time. But the
                        conservative Islamics—especially the staunchly anti-Communist Saudis—can
                        provide Islamic legitimacy and the bankroll to fund the military purchases
                        and the development projects Pakistan so desperately needs.</p>
                    <p>17. (C) The heart of Pakistan’s problem of insecurity, however, lies deep at
                        home, not abroad. Thoughtful Pakistanis, even in the immediate wake of
                        Soviet actions in Kabul, do not really expect Soviet armored columns to
                        proceed through the Torkham and Chaman checkpoints, down the Khyber and
                        Bolan Passes and onto the Indus Plain. However, <pb n="412" facs="0457" xml:id="pg_412"/>the presence of these latter-day Cossacks in Kabul, the
                        ruthless determination with which they were deployed to topple a government,
                        and the expectation that they will in fact fan out through the country, are
                        a source of unease whose full impact has yet to be felt on Pakistan’s
                        internal divisions and unresolved domestic pressures. It will haunt the
                        leadership, and it will dominate public attention, forcing much of
                        Pakistan’s international and policy focus through a one-issue prism.</p>
                    <p>18. (C) Sense of purpose: Pakistanis as a whole do not have much faith in
                        their nation or in its rulers. They routinely assume that Pakistan has
                        little control over its destiny as a nation, and there is wide-spread
                        acceptance that everything that happens in Pakistan is the result of
                        maneuvers by forces engaged in a larger game outside the country. They are
                        prepared to credit or blame the United States for almost every development,
                        from the rise of the Islamic Jamaat-i-Islami to the fall of <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName> and the postponement of elections.
                        Some of this is standard Third World fare, a legacy of anti-Western
                        independence movements in which all flaws were blamed on the former ruling
                        power; independence in this case simply removed the former ruler and
                        replaced his pressures with diversified pressures associated with regional
                        intrigue or super power politics. Some of it is simply a mirror of a South
                        Asian Islamic sense of insecurity in a hostile Hindu world. Some of it is
                        obviously a flight from responsibility, a “cop-out.” But a large part of it
                        simply reflects Pakistan’s pre-occupation with the search for outside
                        support and a tacit acknowledgement—correctly—that Pakistan cannot go it
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>19. (C) <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response: In our response to the
                        events in Afghanistan, we need to be aware of the limits of the Pakistan
                        ability to stand up to the Soviet threat and even to accept our offers of
                        support. The reserved Pakistani response to our public reaffirmation of the
                        1959 bilateral agreement and the public hints—unconfirmed by any official
                        notifications or consultations—that we are prepared to do things in the arms
                        aid area which would assist Pakistan is illustrative. Most editorials in the
                        government and the independent press have come out against acceptance of
                        “unreliable” <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military aid, counselling
                        a cautious approach to any embrace of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, and principal reliance on multilateral organizations
                        including the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic groupings. <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> response thus far has been cautious—and
                        skeptical. Pakistan is not the same place it was in 1959, when it would have
                        welcomed warmly such public posturing by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> In 1980, such <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        pronouncements, without the benefit of full consultations with the
                        Pakistanis, mis-judge this Pakistani sensitivity as well as the new
                        situation in the region.</p>
                    <p>20. (C) Pakistan is, of course, a useful channel through which to demonstrate
                        our concern for the situation in the region and our <pb n="413" facs="0458" xml:id="pg_413"/>determination to stand with our friends, but our
                        actions must be substantive—they must go beyond what we might have been
                        willing to do in 1978 or earlier in 1979. Moreover, they must be the result
                        not of unilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> decisions, broadcast
                        to the world, but rather of close consultation with the Pakistanis. The 1959
                        bilateral rests on a shared perception of the threat from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, which continues. But we and Pakistan
                        have drifted far apart on our perceptions of other aspects of the world
                        situation, notably (but not exclusively) the Iran situation, nuclear
                        non-proliferation, etc. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> actions aimed
                        at reassuring Pakistan can achieve this purpose only if they are perceived
                        to be reassuring in both Islamabad and Washington. They are not apt to be
                        reassuring if they cause alarm in Pakistan or create false expectations here
                        and false fears in India. Confidence in our efforts to reassure can be
                        guaranteed only by close and meaningful and continuous consultations, if not
                        by special emissaries, then by quiet diplomatic exchange.</p>
                    <p>21. (C) Pakistan and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>: As for steps
                        remaining to be done, the agenda is potentially rich.</p>
                    <p>—We have already reaffirmed the applicability of the 1959 bilateral in
                        public; we need to do it formally, either by diplomatic note or, better, by
                        inclusion of this subject in a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">The
                            proposed letter is <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> We
                        need quickly to engage in substantive discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                        needs, and I would add, we must be prepared to go much further than we have
                        so far indicated if our will is not to be challenged and our aid discounted.
                        Cash sales do not aid make. What we have said in public thus far has
                        confused, rather than clarified, and it raises the prospect of our being
                        wrongly blamed for one thing in Islamabad and for the reverse in New
                        Delhi—to no one’s advantage except Moscow’s.</p>
                    <p>—We probably need to consider <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> appeals to
                        support the Afghan exiles in their continued fight against the Soviet-backed
                        Government of Afghanistan. We should be mindful, however, that the exile
                        community in Pakistan increasingly represents little more than itself and
                        controls or is involved in activities only along the border. They have
                        little relationship with or responsibility for the success of anti-regime
                        insurgents operating deep inside Afghanistan. Aid to refugees—now nearing
                        400,000—is another matter.</p>
                    <p>—We need also to consider the whole of our support relationship with
                        Pakistan, not just arms sales, however dramatic, symbolic, and relevant they
                        may be. Our focus should be on arms and the means to pay for them, on
                        economic assistance and debt rescheduling, as well as on <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>–480 and other non-FAA disbursements. And
                        we should not under-estimate the value of political support through
                        consultations <pb n="414" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_414"/>and agreed gestures.
                        But we should, more importantly, look beyond the region to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relationship which it seems to me
                        is brought into a critical juncture by the Soviet rape of Afghanistan and
                        should be the principal forum in which the American reaction should be
                        played out.</p>

                        Shaikh and <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> sat in. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> opened with an expression of gratitude for
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s public
                        reaffirmation of the 1959 agreement. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> noted that this had
                        been done at the instruction of the President. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi>
                        went on to stress Pakistan’s sense of isolation and the questions that
                        Pakistan had about whether the level of interest now visible in Washington
                        will be durable. (S)</p>

                        confirmed our view of the Soviet action in Afghanistan as one of major and
                        lasting importance, carrying with it a threat to Iran and Pakistan. He
                        emphasized that the Soviet action should not be cost-free and that the
                        Afghan resistance should get widespread support. He reassured Sultan that we
                        will act, preferably in concert with other countries, to meet Pakistan’s
                        security needs and we will consult with Congress to reduce impediments to
                        security assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>
                        will be discussing the situation fully in Beijing. (S)</p>

                        stressed that continuation of Pakistani “ambiguity” about its nuclear
                        intentions poses a difficult problem. While we are not making any specific
                        linkage at this point, the Pakistanis must understand that cooperation,
                        especially for the long haul, once the drama of the moment subsides, will be
                        much easier if the “ambiguity” is resolved. The situation has changed in
                        South Asia, and Pakistan should rethink its position just as we have
                        rethought ours. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> reiterated <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> posi<pb n="416" facs="0461" xml:id="pg_416"/>tions and said that Pakistan could not abandon its
                        nuclear efforts. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> responded that we are not asking
                        abandonment, but a greater Pakistani realization that we must minimize all
                        problems between us. (S)</p>
                    <p>On the problem of assistance to the Afghan insurgents, which <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> again emphasized, <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> said that Pakistani actions would depend on
                        their perceptions of US assistance and reliability. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> said that
                        we are considering what we can do in military and economic terms, in
                        addition to public statements. He said that the President would be stating
                        our initial reaction soon. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> recalled that the Pakistanis had asked
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> whether the US was
                        prepared to talk in specifics, and what the extent and nature of US aid
                        would be. Pakistan needs an answer. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> agreed that the US and
                        Pakistan should discuss this as well as the multilateral support that could
                        be generated, and what could jointly be done for the Afghan rebels. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would also continue to consult with
                        other governments and with Congress, and would fashion a tangible response
                        to Pakistan’s needs. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Both</hi> sides noted that each seemed to be waiting for
                        the other to take the next step. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName></hi> stressed that in order
                        to make a realistic presentation, we need a better general idea of what
                        Pakistan thinks it needs, even if Pakistan is not ready to make specific
                        requests. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> agreed that a US response that fell
                        far short of Pakistani hopes would be counterproductive. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> pointed out
                        that we cannot generate a massive package instantly, and we will need to
                        talk to others. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> hoped that this process would
                        not take months. (S)</p>

                        to his residence at 1730 on 5 January for a chat; with him were Foreign

                        me.</p>
                    <p>3. Subject was Afghanistan, which <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        said he and his advisors had been discussing and would be examining further
                        in next few days when <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> Ambs in Moscow
                        and Kabul would be back in town for meetings. Events of 27 January [<hi rend="italic">December</hi>], he said, constitute a fateful “moment in
                        history as far as Pakistan is concerned.” And Pakistan faces “decision which
                        direction to take.” He recapped other major decisions Pakistan had taken
                        during last 32 years, touching on decision to sign 1954 agreement with
                            us,<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">The United States-Pakistan Mutual

                            850–851)</note> to enter Baghdad Pact/<gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>, to join SEATO, then to leave those alliances, and to
                        join with the Non-Aligned Movement. Most of these decisions related to
                        Pakistan security considerations, and Pakistan took its decisions to suit
                        its perception of what circumstances and its best security interests
                        required.</p>
                    <p>4. Now, he said, Pakistan “stands at threshold of decision with only two
                        options: it can either toe the Soviet line, or it can again line up with the
                        Free World. And if the latter, the question is who will support Pakistan and
                        in what magnitude?”</p>
                    <p>5. He said he “had been pleasantly surprised” by President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s very timely telephone call.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">See <ref target="#d111">Document
                            111</ref>.</note> He said he had told <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that Pakistan had come to feel that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not “care for this region . . . that
                        you’d written us off.” He appreciated President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s assessment that a <pb n="418" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_418"/>“qualitative change” had taken place in the region with
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and said he told <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> he would be discussing with <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> how to approach Pakistani
                        requirements and how best to proceed from here in light of events in
                        Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said he was
                        especially encouraged by <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        assurance that he would do his best “to keep our differences away from this
                        important issue.”</p>
                    <p>6. He then reviewed recent Afghan-Pakistan events, noting that short of
                        involving itself physically, all concerned had said the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would go to any lengths to protect the
                        existence of the regime that overthrew Daoud in April 1978. “But in the end,
                        the Russians have become involved physically” in massive numbers, with three
                        divisions in Afghanistan already and 5–7 divisions poised to enter. He had
                        reports that Soviet troops have been seen no more than ten miles from
                        Parachinar, on <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan border; they
                        already occupy Ghazni, Jalalabad, and Kandahar. “We will confront them, no
                        doubt,” he said, “but we must know where we stand.”</p>
                    <p>7. He recapitulated his discussion with Soviet <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> last week in which Soviet <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> asked for “understanding” of Soviet position. “What
                        understanding?” <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> says he asked;
                        “You have committed aggression against my neighbor. You say the regime
                        invited you in. Who invited you?” When <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                        said Babrak, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> replied that Babrak
                        was not in power when troops descended on Kabul. Soviet <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> fudged, stressing Soviet friendliness for
                        Pakistan and emphasizing gains which could accrue from cooperation between
                        the two countries. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> says he
                        demurred, citing Pakistan principles and the presence of Soviet troops in
                        Afghanistan. “Will you get someone to call you into Pakistan too?” he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>8. Soviets have not issued “threats against us,” <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said, but the line “is clear. If they can enter
                        Afghanistan, they can enter Pakistan too.” He added his concerns about India
                        to this mix as well, concerns based on presence of <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> as either “king-maker or
                        queen herself.”<note n="4" xml:id="d145fn4"><persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> became Prime Minister of India on January
                            14.</note> He noted Soviet relationship with India and Indian noises
                        about possible arms for Pakistan from Pakistan friends. “India,” he said,
                        “can forget that we will ever look east after what has happened in
                        Afghanistan. It would be in India’s interest to share our concern about
                        that.” But, he concluded, Pakistan must know where it stands with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> statement says <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will stand by 1959 agreement, even to
                        “defending Pakistan, if necessary.” President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s statement of 4 January “gives impression that

                        concrete evidences of seriousness with which <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> views Soviet actions in Afghanistan. I described for him
                        meetings which have been taking place in Washington and my expectation that
                        I would shortly have the kind of information he sought. I also told him of
                        our conversations, in Delhi and in Washington, with Indian officials in
                        which we told them flatly we do not accept Indian views on the subject of
                        arms for Pakistan.</p>

                        seen and heard of response from other friendly countries in Europe and

                        expressed hope that proposed meeting of Islamic Conference would condemn
                        Afghanistan and possibly aid in easing Iran-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> dispute. I stressed to him our view—as already expressed
                        to <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> FonAdvisor and <gloss target="#t_FonSec_1">FonSec</gloss>—that <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> policy was providing opportunity for Soviets to
                        meddle. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> chimed in to say he had
                        made this point to both Gotabzadeh and members of the Revolutionary Council,
                        including <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName>, but was not sure
                        what effect he had had.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> reverted to his original
                        point, after a brief discussion of various theories to explain Soviet
                        actions in Afghanistan. He said he hoped to hear from Washington “very
                        soon.” He said he did not wish “to create the impression that we are scared
                        or going down the drain” . . . but there is an urgent need to “know who is
                        standing by us.” We need “clear-cut assurances and an idea specifically what
                        will be provided. If taken literally, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s statement could mean everything,” he said; “we need
                        to know for sure.”</p>
                    <p>12. I said I would convey his message immediately to Washington and expressed
                        the hope that my instructions would not be long in coming.</p>

                        did <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> seem fully conversant with
                        extent of my continuing conversations with <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>
                        this week, or even this noon. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        made no mention of <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> proposal
                        (septel) re making 1959 executive agreement into a treaty—a proposal which
                        gives me concern because it could be a <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> creation designed to produce a negative <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> reaction which he might then use in
                        arguments against us.</p>
                    <p>14. There can be no doubt, however, of seriousness of <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s interest in what we will have to say
                        and what we will propose to do [garble—across] the whole range of
                        assistance—military, economic, and political. There should be no doubt in
                        Washington that in order to remain credible with the Pakistanis and to
                        overcome their resistance to too close a re-identification with us, what we
                        will propose will have to be substantial in volume and composition.</p>
                    <p>15. I want to reiterate forcefully my recommendation that in our own
                        interests we should find ways to lay aside for the time being the crippling
                        strictures of the Symington Amendment in order to produce an effective local
                        response to Soviet aggression. Now is the time to reorder our priorities,
                        and to decide which of our objectives is most important during the next few
                        months. We obviously cannot pursue all of our objectives simultaneously
                        because they conflict, and in my strong view our longer-range
                        nonproliferation actions should be temporarily subordinated to the more
                        immediate necessity of making an effective response to Soviet
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>16. I should add that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> gave sharp
                        warning—as <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> had
                        earlier—against any leaks with Western datelines on plans regarding proposed
                        meeting of Islamic Conference. In order to have any chance of success, he
                        said, conference must not be accused of being Western inspired.</p>
                    <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> was in good form, dressed in
                        uniform for the first time in a long time—at least during my visits with

                    <p>2. The following is a catalog of the steps which have been decided upon
                        affecting relations with the Soviet Union. Separate implementing
                        instructions will be provided to Embassy Moscow and other posts as
                        appropriate. This message provides a list which can be used in discussion
                        with host governments of the range of actions decided upon so far. Some
                        additional steps are still under review and may be decided upon at a later
                        date. These measures are being taken in light of President’s statement that
                        business as usual with the Soviet Union is impossible in light of their
                        invasion of Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">In his January 4

                        give the impression that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is primarily a

                        Rather, it is a subject of deep concern for the entire international
                        community as evidenced by the fact that 50 nations have signed a letter
                        calling for Security Council action.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">See <ref target="#d136fn6">footnote 6, Document 136</ref>.</note> Steps which

                        other nations are taking in their bilateral relations with the Soviet Union.
                        If the international community is to succeed in its aims of seeking a Soviet
                        withdrawal from Afghanistan and preventing similar Soviet moves in the
                        future against small independent nations, the Soviet leadership must be
                        fully aware of the costs of action such as the invasion of Afghanistan in
                        multilateral and bilateral terms. Equally important, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies are continuing plans to improve defense
                        capabilities so that they can provide a more effective deterrent to Soviet
                        military moves throughout the world.</p>

                        Interim Appraisal ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>The growing insurgency that threatened to topple a pro-Soviet Marxist regime
                        and create further instability on Soviet borders was the major factor behind
                        Moscow’s invasion of Afghanistan and elimination of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. The Soviets thought the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime was incapable of arresting the
                        disintegration and calculated that Soviet troops were necessary both to
                        change the Afghan leadership and to ensure that the new regime held onto
                        power.</p>
                    <p>The fall of a pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan would have dealt a major
                        blow to Soviet prestige, slowing the momentum behind the broad extension of
                        Soviet influence in the Third World. Moscow probably also thought that
                        dramatic, forceful action would enhance its role as a major regional actor
                        in the Middle East and South Asia and that a Soviet military presence in
                        Afghanistan would place pressure on Iran and Pakistan to accommodate.</p>
                    <p>From Moscow’s perspective, the time probably seemed propitious for the
                        invasion. US-Soviet relations were already at an ebb, and Moscow probably
                        discounted adverse political effects on its international position.</p>
                    <p>Once they decided to remove <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, the
                        Soviets acted decisively to ensure that the new regime would retain control
                        in the face of opposition from dissident Afghan military and insurgent
                        elements. On 27 December, Soviet airborne troops moved quickly to seize
                        control of Kabul. Simultaneously, Moscow moved two Ground Forces divisions
                        into Afghanistan to seize key cities and communication routes.</p>
                    <p><pb n="424" facs="0469" xml:id="pg_424"/>So far, there is no reliable
                        evidence that the Soviet forces now in Afghanistan have launched a
                        large-scale offensive against the insurgents. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> may first want to see if the new regime can command the
                        loyalty of the Afghan Army.</p>
                    <p>The 50,000 or so Soviet troops now there are considerably below the number
                        that would be needed to conduct countrywide anti-insurgent operations.
                        Moscow would need a force upwards of three times that number and would have
                        to tailor it to the difficult Afghan environment.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents are likely to conduct continual harassment of the Soviets, but
                        in view of overwhelming Soviet military superiority, they will not stand and
                        fight against large units. The insurgents are not well organized, equipped
                        or led, but they know the country and have a long history of resistance to
                        foreign domination.</p>
                    <p>There is little prospect that the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> regime can end the insurgency on its own. Faced with
                        continual guerrilla harassment, the Soviets will be under pressure to engage
                        in aggressive military operations and to commit more troops. It is unlikely
                        that Moscow will be dissuaded from this by the prospect of even more damage
                        to its international position.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets probably can eventually suppress the insurgency with more troops
                        and ruthless military action. But political costs to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are likely to mount as Soviet forces
                        engage in prolonged combat operations in an Islamic, Third World
                        country.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Almost from the beginning of the Cold War, detente has been a powerful
                        aspiration for the Europeans. They pursued it earlier and more intensely
                        than did the US—because of their proximity to the Soviets; their individual
                        weakness and hence vulnerability to Soviet threats; their sense of shared
                        social and cultural destiny with Eastern Europe, hence hopes for political
                        reconciliation; their uncertainty that US security guarantees would prove
                        effective in a real crisis; their discomfiture at the dominant role assumed
                        by the US in the West as a result of the Cold War.</p>
                    <p>All these concerns remain alive in Western Europe. The European stake in
                        detente has grown even larger over time. In particular, since the Soviet
                        Union achieved strategic parity with the US, the Europeans have viewed
                        detente not as a product of assured security but rather as an essential
                        ingredient of it. Chief among the benefits of detente for Europe have been
                        the relaxation of political tensions on the Continent and the framework for
                        arms control negotiations that has been established. Detente has also become
                        an important condition for the effective management of domestic politics in
                        European countries where parties of the left play important roles, because
                        with East-West detente, sharp polarization between left and right is easier
                        to avoid. Europeans count on preserving and extending the trade gains and
                        the freedom of movement between East and West that have accompanied detente.
                        (European Community exports to the Soviet Union grew five-fold from 1970 to
                        1978; and the number of immigrants to West Germany from the East was over
                        57,000 in 1978 alone.) The Europeans also hope that in a climate reasonably
                        free of tension, the Soviets will exercise restraint <pb n="426" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_426"/>not only on the Continent but in the Third World, where
                        the Europeans must preserve their access to raw materials.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the prospect of heightened tension between the US and the Soviet
                        Union creates deep apprehension among the Europeans. They would necessarily
                        share in that tension and in the uncertainties it would create. They would
                        see the interests they have pursued through detente put in jeopardy—their
                        security first of all. The adequacy of means they have to defend themselves
                        against Soviet pressure would be again in doubt. At the same time, a clash
                        between the superpowers would threaten the Europeans’ own freedom of action
                        in relation to both the US and the Soviets, and compel them again to rely on
                        US management of the East-West crisis at a time when their doubts about the
                        adequacy and steadfastness of US leadership are grave.</p>
                    <p>Because they have so large a stake in East-West harmony, the Europeans have
                        often been reluctant to support the US when they believed the issues in
                        question were peripheral rather than central to the East-West relationship
                        from their particular perspective. This view was most dramatically reflected
                        in the Europeans’ attitudes toward the Vietnam and even Korean wars. It was
                        also evident in the European reservations about the US alert during the 1973
                        Middle East war.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">A reference to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>

                            suggested the Soviets were prepared to take unilateral action to halt
                            the Israeli military from advancing to Cairo. See <ref target="frus1969-76v25#d269"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations,</hi> 1969–1976, vol. XXV, Arab-Israeli Crisis and
                                War, 1973, Document 269</ref>.</note> It is reflected in Europe’s
                        heavily nuanced approach to Africa—the argument that although the West
                        should oppose Soviet or Soviet-sponsored incursions there, it should do so
                        more by means of economic and technical aid to the Africans than by
                        challenging the Soviets or the Cubans directly. Yet the Europeans have
                        firmly stood with the US in cases where they believed the East-West balance
                        was directly attacked—in Berlin, for example, or during the Cuban missile
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>How the Europeans interpret the events in Afghanistan will strongly influence
                        their response to the measures the US takes against the Soviet Union. They
                        are likely to view the Soviets’ actions as prompted in part by the need to
                        maintain control over the Moslem population within the Soviet Union, by
                        concerns arising from threats to the Soviet role in Eastern Europe, and by
                        obscure internal struggles related to the coming succession. On such an
                        explanation, the Soviet move into Afghanistan might be thought to have
                        rather limited significance in the long run, and to call for only quite
                        restrained reactions on the part of the West.</p>
                    <p><pb n="427" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_427"/>Yet the Europeans also appreciate
                        that Soviet behavior may have major strategic implications, requiring
                        certain kinds of firm resistance on the part of the West in order to ward
                        off any further expansion of Soviet influence in the Third World, to prevent
                        in particular eventual Soviet dominance in the Middle East oil producing
                        region, to deter the Soviets from similar behavior in Europe itself
                        (possibly Yugoslavia), and to discourage Soviet efforts to exert political
                        pressure on the Europeans based on Soviet “successes” elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>European responses to Soviet behavior in Afghanistan will also be affected by
                        the course the Soviet intervention takes in the longer term, and by the
                        threats and inducements the Soviets pose in the European theater as
                        US-Soviet relations chill. Public opinion will be important too—it may
                        surprise European governments by pressing for a firm reaction to the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>At this stage of the crisis, however, the Europeans emphasize that the Afghan
                        crisis is primarily a confrontation between the Soviet Union and the Third
                        World—especially the Moslem nations—and that any response to the Soviets
                        must include the participation of such countries. They have stressed that
                        the Western reaction should be directed specifically to the region of
                        Afghanistan, that it should be restrained in any case, and that major
                        elements of detente such as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> should be
                        preserved as far as possible.</p>
                    <p>However the Europeans eventually assess the Afghan crisis, the extent to
                        which they will support US actions depends crucially on their own special
                        interests and vulnerabilities in relation to the Soviet Union. The British
                        will probably be most forthcoming. The government of Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName>, which is uniquely
                        sensitive to Soviet abuses of power and to ideological differences that
                        persist between the East and the West, has already shown a willingness to
                        undertake firm defense policy measures at considerable cost. Moreover, the
                        British are less vulnerable to the Soviets than the Continental countries;
                        they are still protected to a certain extent by a special relationship with
                        the US; and they have rather less to lose economically by trade
                        restrictions. The British also have traditional links to South Asia that
                        allow them to influence events in that region independently of actions the
                        US may take.</p>
                    <p>The countries on the Continent, however, are highly dependent on continuing
                        oil supplies from the Middle East and would find the prospect of growing
                        Soviet influence on those supplies profoundly alarming. France, in
                        particular, has championed the idea of a special link between Europe, the
                        Middle East, and Africa, and has been willing to intervene in Africa—even
                        militarily—to quell disturbances that might create opportunities from which
                        the Soviets could profit. Yet President <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>, whose government is already under pressure from <pb n="428" facs="0473" xml:id="pg_428"/>the Gaullists in view of next
                        year’s presidential elections, cannot afford to provoke their criticism by
                        taking measures against the Soviets in obvious deference to US wishes; he
                        must maintain a certain distance from US policies. Apart from such domestic
                        considerations, the French government believes that it retains a “special
                        relationship” with the Soviet Union which it would be extremely reluctant to
                        jeopardize. The French have worked especially hard to win Soviet support for
                        the French proposal for a Conference on European Disarmament, and they are
                        most unlikely to take actions that would undermine that effort.</p>
                    <p>Italy has an interest in supporting US measures against the Soviet Union in
                        order to preserve the status it has lately won in the Alliance for backing
                        theater nuclear force modernization and to enhance its role as <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> President and Venice Summit host in the
                        coming months. But the government is especially vulnerable to Soviet
                        economic pressures and inducements—in particular the Soviets are an
                        important natural gas supplier for Italy—and the Italians would press hard
                        for compensation for any costs it might incur in supporting US actions.
                        Domestically, a climate of hostility between the superpowers places the
                        Italian government in an awkward position because of its need for some
                        degree of political cooperation from the Italian Communist Party. Thus, some
                        Italians would be tempted to minimize the crisis, but many others would view
                        it as an opportunity to push the PCI back into a quasi-illegitimate
                        status.</p>
                    <p>West Germany clearly has the most to fear from revived US-Soviet tension. It
                        is most directly vulnerable to Soviet pressures—for example in Berlin—and it
                        has won, correspondingly, the greatest direct benefits from detente.
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>’s own Social
                        Democratic Party initiated West Germany’s reconciliation with the
                        Soviets—the <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>—and has pursued and defended
                        it for more than a decade. The Chancellor must demonstrate enough firmness
                        against the Soviets in crisis to escape unfavorable comparison with his
                        rival in this fall’s elections, the conservative Franz Josef Strauss. But at
                        the same time he cannot afford to abandon detente in Europe—and thus the
                        prospects for some continuing improvement in inner-German relations in
                        particular—unless he has no other option. To do so would risk splitting his
                        party, whose vocal left wing prizes detente especially highly. It could also
                        severely strain his close relationship with French President <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>. The West Germans might well
                        contribute to a stronger Western position in Southwest Asia but they will
                        try to protect their hard-won reconciliation with the Soviets and Eastern
                        Europe—especially East Germany.</p>
                    <p>Under these conditions, most Europeans will certainly hesitate to reinforce
                        East-West tension. They will try instead to limit and confine it, to ensure
                        that detente in Europe is not damaged at the core. They may be tempted to
                        view their proper role as that of mediator between <pb n="429" facs="0474" xml:id="pg_429"/>the superpowers, as often in the past. While
                        recognizing that they must stand with the US to the extent that broad
                        strategic interests are involved, they will also be tempted both
                        collectively and individually to stand apart a certain distance—to preserve
                        and enhance their own influence over how the crisis evolves.</p>
                    <p>In any event, their support for US actions against the Soviet Union following
                        the Afghan invasion will depend especially on their confidence that</p>
                    <quote><p>—their relations with Eastern Europe, and especially inner-German
                            relations, can be insulated to some degree from the US-Soviet
                            confrontation;</p>
                        <p>—the US intends to preserve the framework of detente in Europe to the
                            greatest possible extent, and in particular to pursue ratification of
                            the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement and negotiation of
                            further arms control agreements focused on Europe;</p>
                        <p>—the US will not play the China card so strongly as to encourage an
                            uncontrolled Soviet backlash in Europe or elsewhere;</p>
                        <p>—the US itself is acting in response to an objectively perceived and
                            substantial external threat rather than to domestic political
                            imperatives, and can maintain firm control and steady management of its
                            policy toward the Soviet Union despite the pressures of an election
                            year;</p>
                        <p>—such measures will impose real costs on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, outside the European framework, of a kind that will
                            dissuade it from future such actions and that will limit the gains it
                            can derive from its Afghan move (rather than merely signalling the
                            West’s displeasure);</p>
                        <p>—while some costs may be incurred in their own relationships with the
                            Soviets, the position of the West in the Middle East may be improved (by
                            wider base rights, for example) and relations with the Third World
                            generally will at least not be impaired;</p>
                        <p>—they will not be asked to take actions that will clearly not command the
                            necessary domestic political support;</p>
                        <p>—they will be consulted fully on the implementation of US actions;</p>
                        <p>—the US will help compensate for any economic costs the Europeans may
                            incur by supporting US actions;</p>
                        <p>—to the maximum extent possible they can individually avoid the risk of
                            Soviet reprisals by acting collectively in some multilateral
                            context;</p>
                        <p>—US-European cooperation in the current crisis might lead to a larger
                            European voice in the broad range of East-West issues.</p></quote>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">BROWN</persName>:</hi> Thank you for this information. It is certainly
                        true that what happened to the Muslims in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will not be attractive to the Afghans. However, it is true
                        that over the last ten <pb n="431" facs="0476" xml:id="pg_431"/>years, the
                        Soviets were able to suppress the religious sentiment among the Uzbeks, the
                        Tadzucs, and so on. That is because they obtained little help from the
                        outside. I, myself, visited the area for a few days five years ago—such
                        places as Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bokhara. It was clear to me that the
                        Soviets have been successful in “pacification” and Russification of these
                        Muslim nationalities in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pakistan</p>
                    <p>Let me follow up on Pakistan. We must also work with others to provide
                        additional support for Pakistan. One of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s first moves was to call <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and reassure him of our support. We
                        offered to send <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName>
                        to Islamabad, but the Pakistanis preferred to postpone this.<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">See <ref target="#d111">Document 111</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>—The Pakistanis’ main concern is what might happen to them if the Soviets do
                        gain control in Afghanistan—especially if the Soviets believe that they have
                        grounds for “punishing” the Pakistanis for helping the insurgents. We will
                        do what we can to stiffen the Pakistanis’ resolve to support Afghanistan.
                        What arguments do you think would be most useful for us to use? What do you
                        think you can say to reinforce our representations?</p>
                    <p>—We are in the process of working out the dimensions of our own assistance to
                        Pakistan. We have decided to seek an amendment in our Foreign Assistance
                        Bill to exempt Pakistan from current restrictions in our law which currently
                        prevent us from extending <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits and
                        Economic Support Fund assistance to Pakistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> We have already
                        approached Congressional leaders on the subject. While plans are as always
                        subject to Congressional concurrence, what we have heard from Congress is
                        encouraging. We are thinking in terms of providing very substantial amounts
                        of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ESF_1">ESF</gloss> over the next five years to the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>’s. We are also seeking additional support for [<hi rend="italic">from</hi>?] Western and Moslem countries.</p>
                    <p>—While we are planning to resume economic and military assistance to Pakistan
                        despite the nuclear problem, it would obviously be easier for us to secure
                        Congressional support for a large program if the Paks reassessed their
                        nuclear activities. We don’t want to let this stand in the way. But what we
                        can do will be influenced by Pakistan’s nuclear program.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">India</p>
                    <p>—India remains a critical element. A strategy that preserves Pakistan but
                        propels India into greater dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is unwise. <pb n="432" facs="0477" xml:id="pg_432"/>The
                        key is to get India to recognize that the new situation in Afghanistan poses
                        a security problem for the <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> subcontinent. It is
                        unfortunate that there has been no effectively functioning Indian government
                        during recent weeks.</p>
                    <p>—It is important that the most favorable context be created for an Indian
                        policy reassessment. In particular, the Indians must be brought to realize
                        that there is no longer a concern about a threat from China. We think it is
                        important that you renew a dialogue with the new Indian government and seek
                        a compromise understanding on the border issue that would permit India to
                        turn its attention elsewhere. We believe this deserves your serious
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>—The events in Afghanistan are a major historical turning point which
                        increases the likelihood of a major US military presence in an entirely new
                        region of the world. Nobody at this point can predict with certitude what
                        the outcome of these events will be, although the Soviet reaction to various
                        protests and denunciations, including those of both the US and China, is
                        completely predictable. These prospects were taken into consideration by the
                        Soviets before they made their move in Afghanistan. It is therefore
                        incumbent on both of us to exceed the Soviet expectation as to what our
                        response would be.<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">In a message to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, January 4, <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> noted that in preparatory

                            to, would improve the chance that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> will join in or, at a minimum, tell us more about what

                            have been providing modest levels of humanitarian assistance to the
                            Afghan insurgents. This has taken the form principally of medicines,
                            food and clothing. Contrary to Soviet allegations, we have not provided
                            any training to the Afghan insurgents. After the Soviet invasion, our
                            assistance has taken on an increased urgency and now includes small
                            arms, ammunition, anti-tank and anti-helicopter weapons, and other
                            military items appropriate to this kind of insurgency. Some of this
                            military equipment is probably already in the hands of the insurgents,
                            if not, it will be soon. We would welcome Chinese participation in the
                            support of the insurgency and offer to coordinate what we are doing with

                            participation were made known without their knowledge, it could
                            jeopardize both the current program and our credibility.” (Message 90

                    <p>The domestic situation in Pakistan is rather difficult. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> faces a number of difficulties. If the
                        Soviets’ barbarous aggression goes unchecked, the next target is Pakistan.
                        Now Pakistan also thinks along this line. Now Pakistan’s leaders are very
                        worried about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>If the new Indian Government should keep on opposing Pakistan, even in a more
                        fierce way, Pakistan will be sandwiched between Afghanistan and India with
                        even more problems on its hands. After studying this question, we have
                        concluded we must boost <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> determination
                        to resist the Soviet Union. Now, after the event in Afghanistan, the US has
                        made a decision to extend military aid to Pakistan. We think that you have
                        made the right decision. We hope your aid will arrive in a timely fashion
                        and that there will be plenty of assistance and that we will not see the
                        restrictions to aid you have placed in the past.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>As for Afghanistan, the Soviet’s massive invasion warrants attention and
                        concern on our part. In this respect, the Soviet Union’s own troops are
                        directly involved in undisguised invasion, like the invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now the Soviet Union has extended its so-called
                        theory of limited sovereignty from socialist countries to a non-aligned,
                        Muslim country of the Third World. If the Soviet Union can <pb n="434" facs="0479" xml:id="pg_434"/>do this in Afghanistan today, the
                        likelihood is that they can do it to Pakistan, or some other country,
                        tomorrow—the first targets would be Iran and Pakistan. While Afghanistan is
                        the first country, the Soviet Union mainly has its eyes on Asia, and the
                        action poses a threat to South Asia and the Gulf area as well. It occurred
                        at a time the US experienced a tense situation vis-a-vis Iran.<note n="6" xml:id="d149fn6">A memorandum from Holbrooke to <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, January 31, included the
                            following expanded exchange on Afghanistan between <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> and Geng: “Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName>: I believe we must take action to
                            provide political and material support to the insurgent forces in
                            Afghanistan. And in this regard, I have a couple of questions for you:
                            What support is China currently providing the Afghan insurgents? Do you
                            have plans to expand that support? Vice Premier Geng: We are very
                            pleased to hear the US Government has made the decision to provide
                            assistance to the anti-government forces in Afghanistan and to Pakistan.
                            You know that we have been giving aid to the Pakistanis and they are
                            satisfied with what we have done. As to Afghanistan, we plan to give
                            assistance to various organizations, groups, and peoples in Afghanistan
                            in resistance to the Soviet invasion. We plan to give them assistance
                            via Pakistan. However, our assistance has to be in limited quantity.
                            While Afghanistan is the first country, the Soviet Union mainly has its
                            eyes on Asia, and the action poses a threat to South Asia and the Gulf
                            area as well. It occurred at a time the US experienced a tense situation
                            vis-à-vis Iran.” (Briefing Memorandum, January 31; Department of State,

                    <p>—The Soviet Union may gain something temporarily, but in the longer term they
                        will gain the opposite of what they set out to do. Now a new situation has
                        been created. All the Muslim countries and peace-loving countries have risen
                        up in opposition to Soviet hegemonism. Even Iran has registered its protest
                        to the Soviet Union over its invasion. And these factors may help to bring
                        an early resolution to the crisis between the US and Iran. It seems to me to
                        a large extent we should talk to other countries about the matter and do a
                        good job of it.</p>

                        Chinese defense capability will help maintain peace and resist Soviet
                        hegemony. I even went to the point of saying <pb n="436" facs="0481" xml:id="pg_436"/>to one American friend there are one million Soviet
                        troops in the east which we don’t think are directed solely against China.
                        But, if they were solely directed against China and if we could pin down two
                        million Soviet troops, what harm would that do? You must be aware of my
                        thoughts.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">DR. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">BROWN</persName>:</hi> Yes.
                        The question you have raised is in the midst of being implemented. The
                        United States and Europe are each improving their strengths and increasing
                        their cooperation. Japan is increasing its defense expenditure and closely
                        cooperating with the United States. US/Chinese cooperation is also
                        increasing.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_DXH_1">DENG</persName>:</hi> We, on
                        our part, are satisfied with what Japan, Europe, and the United States have
                        done—that this is the correct line of action. If I may say, it would have
                        been better if this could have been done even earlier. If so, some events
                        could have been avoided. Please don’t regard this as a critical comment; it
                        is just my analysis.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">DR. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">BROWN</persName>:</hi> We
                        just should learn from the past to coordinate our actions now and take
                        visible parallel actions. Regarding Afghanistan, we have agreed to follow-on
                        talks and parallel actions. For example, we’ve agreed to aid the Afghanistan
                        rebels whom the Soviets hope to crush because of their religion and we are
                        also going to help Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_DXH_1">DENG</persName>:</hi> As far
                        as Afghanistan is concerned, the only correct approach to Afghanistan is to
                        give aid to the resistance forces, and we should work together on this. But,
                        I’d emphasize that this kind of aid must be more than symbolic. I must note
                        the fact that Soviet aggression involves the fate of the whole nation. Facts
                        in Afghanistan prove that most of the Afghan troops have leaned toward the
                        resistance forces, although some have been disarmed. The Afghan people have
                        been fighting fiercely against Soviet aggression. We must turn Afghanistan
                        into a quagmire in which the Soviet Union is bogged down for a long time in
                        a guerrilla warfare.</p>
                    <p>Vice Premier Geng earlier assured me that provided aid to Pakistan was more
                        than symbolic, there would be no difficulty in using Chinese overflight as
                        one way of delivering supplies.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">See <ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> It is also important that
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> supply the Afghanistan freedom

                        With regard to question of South Asia, there is no other way except giving
                        aid to Pakistan. As you know, it has always been our view that the US policy
                        giving more attention to India than Pakistan is not an appropriate policy.
                        Regarding India, we have always felt that the United States should try to
                        cultivate good relations, and this has had a good effect. But India is not a
                        stabilizing factor. Perhaps you already know the general election
                        results.</p>

                        not know, but in any case, if no Party gains a majority, it will take some
                        time to settle. Perhaps you can say how that will come out.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> has gotten 70% of the
                        vote. It is very difficult to judge at this time how India will go. Even if
                            <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> should follow
                        India’s previous policy; still India is not the most reliable and
                        stabilizing factor in southern Asia. Let’s not talk about <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName>. The present government is
                        thinking of recognizing the Heng Samrin Regime. Perhaps after Pakistan has
                        been strengthened, India will become a more stabilizing factor. What one
                        should try to achieve is to make Pakistan a genuine stabilizing factor in
                        South Asia. We hope the United States will give earnest and sincere thought
                        to this question. If one does not keep this clear in one’s mind, then one’s
                        attitude toward India will make one vacillate in one’s position toward
                        Pakistan. In the past the United States has refrained from aiding Pakistan.
                        I think in part this is the work of India, probably because of a fear of
                        offending India. Since you now have decided to aid Pakistan, I am sure India
                        will send you one note after another, strongly objecting.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">DR. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">BROWN</persName>:</hi>
                        There are limits on our ability to aid Pakistan because of their nuclear
                        explosive program. Although we still object to their doing so, we will now
                        set that aside for the time being, to facilitate strengthening Pakistan
                        against potential Soviet action.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_DXH_1">DENG</persName>:</hi> That is
                        a very good approach. Pakistan has its own reasons for developing a nuclear
                        program. We ourselves oppose the Pakistan effort on nuclear weapons because
                        we believe it meaningless to spend money on such a program. Pakistan has its
                        own arguments, i.e., India has exploded a nuclear device but the world has
                        not seemed to complain about this. So now you have decided to put this aside
                        and solve the question of military and economic aid to Pakistan. We applaud
                            <pb n="438" facs="0483" xml:id="pg_438"/>this decision. We give large
                        amounts of assistance to Pakistan. One can say that great amounts of
                        military equipment now in the hands of Pakistani troops come from China. In
                        order to strengthen our links with Pakistan, we have built a highway in the
                        most difficult terrain through the mountains. The question of continuing
                        Chinese aid to Pakistan does not exist. Moreover, Chinese armaments are
                        rather poor in quality. While the United States has decided to give aid to
                        Pakistan, you must now convince Pakistan this is a sincere and genuine US
                        effort and make them believe that they will benefit from modern US weapons.
                        I know that the Pakistanis have many grievances against the United States.
                        This developed to the point that Pakistan withdrew from <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>. Have you approached Pakistan on the

                        formula should be used, Pakistan will be in an increasingly inferior
                        position. We hope that since the United States decided to give aid to
                        Pakistan, it will really satisfy Pakistan’s requirements. We hope your aid
                        to Pakistan will not be affected too much by India’s reaction. This is
                        especially important since <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira

                        must also remember that Soviet actions are directed not only at Pakistan but
                        also at Iran. The United States is in <pb n="439" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_439"/>a very difficult position vis-a-vis Iran. Iran is a
                        very complicated question. So long as the hostages are held, we cannot have
                        good relations. We need Chinese support on the United Nations sanctions
                        because if there is no vote for sanctions there will be increasing pressure
                        on the United States to take unilateral action against Iran. That could be
                        damaging but necessary. In that event US-Sino relations would be strained.

                        Foreign Military Sales credit, about which <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted: “All agencies agree that this is
                        required.” <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> approved the
                        sub-item. Next was $100 million in Economic Support Funds. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted: “All agencies agree in
                        this sum,” and the only question was if the aid should be conditional.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> concurred with the
                        Department of State that the aid package would not be as effective if it was
                        tied to ongoing Pakistani financial reform measures, and that the United
                        States should pledge to rejoin the international aid consortium for Pakistan
                        but not “attach additional strings” to the economic package. At the end of
                        the sub-item, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> handwrote:
                        “This is really important.” <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        neither approved nor disapproved the sub-item, but wrote in the right
                        margin: “$100 mil ok—I prefer auth. to waive reform requirement if necessary
                        Paks must be under constraint to behave economically.”</p>
                    <p>The next sub-item offered a choice on the level of specificity for the aid
                        package. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted the
                        Department of State “argues strongly” that the United States should present
                        a $400 million aid package, composed of $100 million in both economic and
                        military aid per annum over two years. <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted, advocated a
                        looser approach “both for reasons of impact and to concretely demonstrate
                        the enduring nature of our commitment.” <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> concurred with the Department of State, and
                        handwrote: “because it indicates a longer-term political commitment.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> approved the <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> approach, but wrote in the right margin:
                        “I may change. Let me see what <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName> says.” <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        also approved the following sub-items: 1) a $10–20 million increase in
                            <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>–480 aid; 2) $600,000 for military
                        training; 3) $6 million in additional aid for Afghan refugees; and 4)
                        whether humanitarian aid should be sent through the United Nations High
                        Commissioner for Refugees (<gloss target="#t_UNHCR_1">UNHCR</gloss>).
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> wrote: “it should be
                        bilateral with Pakistan” to which <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> responded: “bilateral, at least as option.”</p>
                    <p>The third item laid out what <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> identified as a “key issue”: the kind of military
                        hardware the United States should sell to Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that $100 million “will
                        not go far,” and that a “critical question” was whether or not <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> was prepared to sell Pakistan
                        advanced aircraft such as the F–16. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> did not recommend one or the other, but counseled
                        that if <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> disapproved of
                        selling the F–16 to Pakistan “we should let the Paks know soon so that India
                        does <pb n="441" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_441"/>not mount a campaign against
                        it and Pakistan does not make it a litmus test of our relationship.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> rejected selling the F–16
                        to Pakistan. He expounded on his decision in a handwritten note on an
                        undated memorandum from the Department of Defense with an attached itemized
                        list of military hardware for possible transfer to Pakistan. Both the list
                        and the memorandum were attached at Tab C to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s January 8 memorandum. The Department of Defense
                        stated: “we need to keep India in mind as we make military supply decisions
                        for Pakistan. India will be concerned in principle about the resumption of a
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan supply relationship, and
                        in this sense whatever we supply will be troublesome for India; none of the
                        items proposed for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> funding, however,
                        would in themselves pose a significant threat to India.” In the left margin,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “I agree,” and at
                        the bottom of the page he wrote: “we should approve quickly: weapons which
                        can be used to defend both Afghan &amp; Paks as soon as possible—in general,
                        however, not to attack India. J.”</p>
                    <p>On the evening of January 8, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        briefed Members of Congress on Iran and on the actions his administration
                        had taken and planned to take after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,

                        <item>A Long-Term Strategy for Coping with the Consequences of the Soviet
                            Action in Afghanistan</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You have stressed—rightly so—that the Soviet action has created consequences
                        which cannot be dealt with in only a few weeks or with a series of
                        short-term measures. The Soviet action poses a test involving <pb n="442" facs="0487" xml:id="pg_442"/>ultimately the balance of power between
                        East and West. Our response will determine how several key states will
                        adjust their foreign policy and particularly whether they will accommodate
                        themselves to the projection of Soviet military power.</p>
                    <p>Before outlining for you an agenda of possible responses, let me put the
                        foregoing in a brief historical context, which may also be useful to you
                        when you comment on the subject. We have, in effect, entered the fifth
                        decade in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet competition. Each
                        of the decades has had a specific historical character:</p>
                    <p>1. The 1940’s: consolidation of Soviet gains in the context of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> disarmament after World War II and probes
                        for Western weakness;</p>
                    <p>2. The 1950’s: lines drawn sharply in the West and in the East (the Iron
                        Curtain, the Korean buffer);</p>
                    <p>3. The 1960’s: premature Soviet global challenge; increasing competition in
                        other areas: economic (we will bury you); space (Sputnik); with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> then becoming bogged down in Vietnam after
                        the respite won in Cuba, with massive Soviet investments in defense.</p>
                    <p>4. The 1970’s: detente and continued buildup of Soviet strength;</p>
                    <p>5. The 1980’s: the danger of conflict in the context of wider global
                        turbulence.</p>
                    <p>It is both symbolic and significant that Soviet action in Afghanistan
                        occurred in the first week of the new decade of the 1980’s. To respond to
                        that initiative, we need to generate a wider domestic consensus behind
                        legislative and budgetary matters. Anything less will cause vacillation and
                        accommodation by our allies and by states within the Persian Gulf
                        region.</p>
                    <p>The context for a major response is provided by the three interdependent
                        central strategic zones of our concern: Western Europe, the Far East, and
                        the Persian Gulf. We have an alliance system and military deployments in two
                        of these regions. We are only beginning to create a significant military
                        posture in the third, the Persian Gulf. Accordingly, our response to the
                        Soviet Union action ought to deal with the following aspects:</p>
                    <p>I. Regional Security</p>
                    <p>A. Unilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Actions</p>
                    <p>1. Covert Assistance. We have in recent months authorized a number of new

                        Context</p>
                    <p>—Soviet actions in Afghanistan, regardless of their motives, have changed the
                        strategic situation in the region; and we must take steps which will restore
                        a balance. The steps outlined under Regional Security began to address this
                        balance.</p>
                    <p>—This development requires two classes of response on our part.</p>
                    <p>• First, the actions which you have already taken vis-a-vis the Soviets in
                        the economic and other areas have clearly demonstrated to the Soviets that
                        their behavior will not be cost-free. I think the Soviets were surprised by
                        your actions. Thus, further bilateral steps are not necessary; however, we
                        must follow through with full implementation of the steps which have already
                        been taken.<note n="12" xml:id="d152fn12"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> underlined “must follow through,” and in the left
                            margin wrote: “I agree.”</note></p>
                    <p>• Second, to counter growing Soviet aggressiveness, a long-term commitment is
                        required. There are no easy solutions to an increased willingness on the
                        part of the Soviets to use the military power which they have built over the
                        past decade at great domestic cost. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        strategic modernization, increased defense spending, improvements in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_RDF_1">RDF</gloss> are all steps which will in time work to deter the Soviets,
                        if pursued diligently.</p>
                    <p>—Because the Soviets underestimated the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        response as well as that of the international community, especially the
                        third world, to their invasion, we should expect that as soon as
                        possible—within several months—the Soviets will embark on a peace offensive
                        designed to separate us from our allies and to improve the Soviet image in
                        the <pb n="445" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_445"/>third world. We should
                        anticipate this event and be prepared to counter efforts to deter us from
                        our required course.<note n="13" xml:id="d152fn13">In the left margin,

                    <p>These are preliminary thoughts. In effect, they add up to three key
                        propositions:</p>
                    <p>1. Our response has to be a <hi rend="italic">sustained one and a regional
                            one</hi>. Success or failure will depend on what we do in terms of the
                        longer run in Southwest Asia. You might want to think of a “<persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> doctrine.”<note n="14" xml:id="d152fn14"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>

                            wrote in the left margin: “No name.”</note></p>
                    <p>2. There is <hi rend="italic">no need</hi> to freeze the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relationship any further, but by
                        the same token we should have no illusions about an early improvement—nor
                        should we strive for one. Any alteration, of course, would look like a zig
                        zag, and it would make the attainment of our first objective more difficult,
                        while undercutting your domestic support.<note n="15" xml:id="d152fn15">In

                    <p>3. Whatever we do in the region, <hi rend="italic">it will be costly</hi>.
                        The more we can do with our allies, the better, but the major initiative
                        will have to come from us.</p>
                    <p>These are painful and difficult issues. We will never know whether any of
                        this could have been averted, but we do know one thing: if we do not respond
                        in a timely fashion, the consequences of an inadequate response will be even
                        more horrendous because our vital interest in the Middle East will soon be
                        directly affected.</p>

                    <p>Peshawar, on the Pakistani side of the Khyber Pass, has for a century been
                        the most important safehaven for Afghans who oppose whatever regime may be
                        in power in Kabul. Following the Marxist coup in April 1978, the number of
                        Peshawar-based dissidents grew and there was a proliferation of marginal and
                        essentially ineffective “liberation groups”. Lacking meaningful financial
                        support, the exile groups have had at best a modest impact on the course of
                        the insurgency. Fragmentary reporting suggests they have provided insurgent
                        groups in eastern Afghanistan with some material assistance, but the rebels’
                        main source of arms has been stocks captured from Afghan Army units or
                        turned over by deserting Afghan troops and bought from arms dealers in
                        Pakistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling
                            restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The numerous fragmented and feuding organizations acknowledge no single
                        leader and have made numerous unsuccessful efforts to unify the Afghan exile
                        opposition. An exile leader’s claim to the press after a recent meeting to
                        have united exile organizations to counter the new Soviet threat is probably
                        as insubstantial as earlier similar claims.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">A
                            likely reference to a statement made by Ali Tabib, spokesman for the
                            Afghan National Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>), who promised that major Afghan opposition groups,
                            including the <gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>, the Islamic
                            Society, the Islamic Party, and the Islamic Revolutionary Movement
                            planned to announce their “organizational unification” against Soviet
                            forces. Tabib also stated: “the key will be for us to make this war as
                            costly for the Russians as Vietnam was for the Americans.” Tabib was

                            1980, p. 7.</note> Among its leaders there is no figure with religious

                        Soviet-installed Kabul regime or serve as the leader of a new government.
                        The exile groups probably do not have a sufficient number of technically
                        qualified members who could form a new government. It is possible exile
                        organizations could, however, contribute a few cabinet-level officials to a
                        national front government made up of officials from former governments who
                        might have survived Communist purges since April 1978. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p><pb n="447" facs="0492" xml:id="pg_447"/>With the exception of one or
                        possibly two groups that have a small guerrilla capability, the exile
                        organizations do not command forces that have been active in the Afghan
                        insurgency. One organization, the Islamic Party operates a clandestine radio
                        in the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan border area that has
                        probably made some impact in whipping up sentiment against the “godless”
                        Kabul regime. Some exile religious leaders, moreover, are reported to cross
                        the border into Afghanistan occasionally to buoy the morale of insurgent
                        tribes responsive to their religious leadership. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The exile groups are likely to continue their infighting and probably will
                        have no more than a marginal effect on the course of the insurgency unless
                        Pakistan takes the lead in trying to unite or at minimum increase the
                        coordination among the diverse groups. Without the assistance of Pakistan,
                        moreover, the establishment of an exile command and control structure that
                        could coordinate insurgent military action on a national scale would be
                        beyond the capability of the Afghan exiles. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The exile groups could become a more effective conduit for channeling arms,
                        food and funds to insurgent groups if Pakistan took charge of overseeing
                        logistical arrangements. The Saudis have withheld more substantial financial
                        aid to the exile groups—their payments probably total no more than $5
                        million—because they regard their disorganized, and uncoordinated efforts as
                        ineffectual in supporting the insurgency. Some of the Saudi money reportedly
                        has lined the pockets of some exile leaders. If the Saudis suspect that
                        their funds are being misused—and they probably do—this would inhibit them
                        from making further contributions to support the insurgency. They might be
                        encouraged to reopen their coffers if Pakistan took responsibility for
                        overseeing the expenditure of funds by the exile groups. A key factor in any
                        Saudi decision would be their perception of US intentions regarding possible
                        support of the insurgents.</p>
                    <p>The exile groups are the source of numerous misleading if not false stories
                        that have appeared in the press on various aspects of the insurgency. Some
                        of these stories allege the exiles exert command and control over guerrilla
                        groups operating in Afghanistan. Other accounts have made exaggerated claims
                        of rebel “victories” and, since Soviet intervention, of Soviet offensives
                        against rebel strongholds.<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">See <ref target="#d143fn2">footnote 2, Document 143</ref>.</note> ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>

                            government. Gul Buddin’s group probably has conducted a few raids in
                            Afghanistan since the Marxists took power in 1978 and it may pass some
                            arms to insurgent groups operating in Afghanistan. It reportedly
                            continues to receive some support from Pakistan. The Islamic Party is
                            somewhat more secular in outlook than other exile groups and Gul
                            Buddin’s rejection of the monarchy as a possible alternative to the
                            present regime has tended to isolate him from other exile leaders. The
                            Islamic Party was represented at the recent meeting at which the groups
                            in attendance claimed to have succeeded in their effort to unite their
                            organizations. Gul Buddin’s group has roots in the area between Ghazni
                            and Qandahar and is most active there. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                        Afghan incursion into Pakistani areas along the border where Afghan refugees
                        are concentrated, but they have a much greater fear of attempts to assist

                        letter personally from the President concerning coordinated Western response

                    <p>3. In delivering letter, you may draw as appropriate on following points:</p>
                    <p>—President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> asked that I
                        request this appointment with you to deliver a personal message from him
                        concerning the situation in Afghanistan and to convey to you his views
                        regarding the Western response to that crisis.</p>
                    <p>—We completely share your view of the Soviet invasion as a serious threat to
                        peace, and we intend to follow through vigorously on the measures announced
                        by the President on January 4.</p>
                    <p>—The President has asked that I pass on to you his very great appreciation
                        for the public support you have given to our position.</p>
                    <p>—We have valued our close consultations with you, both at the London and
                        Brussels meetings last week, and in our discussions together, and we look
                        forward to continued close cooperation. We have been particularly grateful
                        for your vigorous démarches in Third World capitals, urging those countries
                        to join in condemnation of Soviet actions.</p>

                        East-West relations. If we fail to do so, the Soviets may only be encouraged
                        to take similar moves elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>—The President looks forward to staying in the closest possible communication
                        with you, as our two governments further develop their positions, and he has
                        asked me to be available to you and your government to assist in any way
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>4. Begin text of letter:</p>
                    <p>Dear Margaret:</p>
                    <p>As I know you will agree, the Soviet Union’s invasion and occupation of
                        Afghanistan are matters of the gravest concern. In my view, the Soviet
                        action represents one of the most serious security challenges which our
                        countries have faced in the post-war era. This naked aggression has
                        implications in Southwest Asia and the Middle East, as well as globally, in
                        the bilateral relationship between each of our countries and the Soviet
                        Union, and in the multilateral relationships which have developed among the
                        countries of the West and the Warsaw Pact involving European matters in the
                        past decade. A failure on our part to respond adequately to the Soviet
                        challenge in Afghanistan can only encourage Moscow to move in the future
                        even more aggressively. Pakistan, Iran, the Gulf, Yugoslavia, and even
                        Turkey come immediately to mind. By the same token, a strong united Western
                        response can correct Soviet perceptions, restrain Soviet behavior and
                        ultimately advance the cause of détente to which both our countries are
                        dedicated over the longer term. I know that you share my view that in these
                        circumstances, it is imperative that you and I and our representatives in
                        Washington and London maintain close and continuous consultations and
                            coordination.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">An article in the President’s
                            Daily Brief, January 10, noted that the British had taken the most
                            “aggressive stance” among the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            Allies, who so far had been “unable to agree on a strong response to the
                            Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.” The article also noted that France
                            opposed the British call for the Alliance to apply sanctions against the
                            Soviet Union, advocating instead that nations should respond to the
                            invasion bilaterally. Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_PDB_1">PDB</gloss> noted, the West Germans were caught in a “dilemma”
                            because “<persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> realizes that a
                            weak response would give his political opponents a good election issue,
                            but fears that a vigorous reaction would undermine Ostpolitik, the
                            keystone of 12 years of Social Democratic foreign policy.” (Central

                    <p>You are already familiar with the measures which I announced on January 4
                        involving our bilateral relations with the Soviet Union, and I appreciate
                        your support for these actions.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">See <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>. For <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s January 4 address, see <ref target="#d145fn5">footnote 5, Document 145</ref>.</note> I had previously announced
                        my decision that the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty not be
                        called up for <pb n="454" facs="0499" xml:id="pg_454"/>Senate action in
                        light of the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. I did not
                        withdraw the treaty because I believe its ratification would be in the
                        interest of the West, and I hope that circumstances will, in time, make it
                        possible for me to request that the Senate proceed with action on the
                        treaty. Further, I believe that it is important to continue our efforts in
                            <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> to reach agreement with the East
                        which will lower military forces and tensions in Europe and to pursue
                        vigorously our <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> arms control proposal.
                        In my judgment we should also continue to participate in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> process which if carefully managed
                        promotes Western interests.</p>
                    <p>However, I feel strongly that we would be making a grave error should we, in
                        the interest of preserving an atmosphere of détente, attempt to separate
                        developments in Southwest Asia involving the Soviet Union from the bilateral
                        or multilateral relations which we have with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The process of détente can continue only if we,
                        collectively and individually, make clear to the Soviet Union that actions
                        such as its invasion and occupation of Afghanistan must have serious
                        consequences for the Soviet Union in other areas of the world, including
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan is simply not consistent with
                        détente in Europe, and this must be made clear to the Soviet leadership. If
                        Moscow does wish to pursue détente, then in the wake of Afghanistan it must
                        give us evidence of such a desire. The most convincing confirmation of
                        Moscow’s desire to retrace its steps back to policies consistent with the
                        principles of détente would be an early and total withdrawal of Soviet
                        troops from Afghanistan. To this point, I regret to say that we have seen no
                        evidence that that is Moscow’s intention and the continually growing <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> deployment in Afghanistan appears to us
                        to suggest that the Soviet Army went to that small and defenseless country
                        to stay. And in the light of other Soviet activities in the
                        region—especially in Ethiopia and the Yemens—we would have to regard a
                        prolonged Soviet occupation of Afghanistan as part of a calculated strategic
                        thrust against the West’s vital interests.</p>
                    <p>We have already noted a predictable tendency in the Soviet Union’s propaganda
                        to try to divide the United States and Western Europe over the matter of
                        Afghanistan. Indeed, I think we can expect the Soviets to launch a “peace
                        offensive” in Europe in the near future. Moscow will undoubtedly hope that
                        by offering various inducements to West European countries they can secure a
                        “business-as-usual” approach by these countries, a tacit agreement to let
                        concern about the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan fade away. I know that
                        you will be particularly sensitive to this Soviet objective and will work
                        with me and our colleagues from the other Western European countries to
                        ensure that this Soviet aim is not realized.</p>
                    <p><pb n="455" facs="0500" xml:id="pg_455"/>Finally, I want to assure you that I
                        am prepared to commit the United States to take the necessary steps to
                        enhance security in Southwest Asia and the Middle East, not just because of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests, but because of the broad
                        stakes the West in general has in this region’s stability and the flow of
                        oil. In this effort, it will be important for the United States to have the
                        support—and in some cases the direct involvement of our European allies. The
                        challenge to our common and crucial interests in this area is unprecedented;
                        it calls for an unprecedented and coordinated Western response. This
                        includes support for Pakistan, intensified political involvement with
                        specific nations stretching from Southwest Asia to the Eastern
                        Mediterranean, increased security involvement and military presence,
                        increased economic assistance, as appropriate, and arms support to friendly
                        nations. The United Kingdom’s role in this effort will be particularly
                        important and I look forward to learning of Peter <persName corresp="#p_CLAC_1">Carrington</persName>’s impressions after his visit
                        to the region.<note n="4" xml:id="d156fn4">See <ref target="#d145fn6">footnote 6, Document 145</ref>. Subsequently, <persName corresp="#p_CLAC_1">Carrington</persName> visited the region in
                            February. Telegram 3930 from Bonn, February 29, reported on a meeting
                            between <persName corresp="#p_CLAC_1">Carrington</persName> and

                            that the European Community should attempt to determine the likelihood
                            of Moscow’s intention to withdraw, but they were under no illusions that
                            in fact, “the Soviets are digging themselves deeper every day.”

                        Pakistanis it was “not too late” to respond to Afghanistan’s appeal for
                        better relations. Pakistan’s condemnation of Soviet actions in the Security
                        Council debate, coupled with its dialogue with the US over security
                        reassurances, have since appeared to prompt Moscow to toughen its treatment
                        of the Pakistanis.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">Pakistan was one of 52

                        Policy ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>Soviet decisions on the scope and timing of the intervention in Afghanistan
                        were dictated largely by the situation in that country, but—once Moscow
                        decided to invade—it presumably anticipated geopolitical gains that extended
                        beyond Afghanistan. The naked display of Soviet military strength, moreover,
                        will generate opportunities and costs that will affect Soviet foreign policy
                        on a global basis.</p>
                    <p>In moving into Afghanistan, Moscow probably calculated that, in view of the
                        decline in Soviet-American relations in recent years, it did not have much
                        to lose in its relations with the United States. The Soviet leaders knew
                        that they would have to pay a price in their relations with the West and
                        that their actions would create deep suspicions about Soviet policy within
                        the Third World. Past precedents, however, probably gave the Soviet
                        leaders—most of whom participated in the decision to invade
                        Czechoslovakia—ample reason to believe that, over time, their willingness to
                        use military force in Afghanistan would enhance their efforts to extend
                        their worldwide influence.</p>
                    <p>Moscow will attempt to show that it can wait out any US retaliation by
                        turning to third country suppliers of embargoed or restricted goods. It may
                        also undertake some retaliatory steps of its own, such as increased
                        pressures on dissidents, harassment of US citizens in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and efforts to isolate the US
                        politically from its allies and from the Third World on the issue of
                        Afghanistan. In the face of increasing US pressures, it might take further
                        steps—in Cuba, Berlin, or on arms control—to exacerbate relations with the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p><pb n="458" facs="0503" xml:id="pg_458"/>In the near term, Moscow will seek
                        to consolidate its gains in southwest Asia and attempt to minimize the costs
                        elsewhere. To date the Soviets appear surprised by the forcefulness of the
                        US response which, together with the general outrage expressed by most
                        non-Communist nations, may be giving Moscow reason to believe it
                        underestimated the wider effects of its actions in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason to believe that foreknowledge of these responses would
                        have altered the Soviet decision to intervene, but Moscow may have to give
                        more attention than it had thought necessary to its relations with the world
                        community. In Europe, for example, we would expect the Soviets to appear to
                        be more accommodating on disarmament issues while portraying the United
                        States as the principal obstacle to progress. In the Middle East, Moscow
                        will attempt to divert Arab attention away from the Soviet attempt to crush
                        a Muslem insurgency and back toward American support of the Egyptian-Israeli
                        peace process. Elsewhere in the Third World, the Soviets will try to counter
                        the damage to their image among the nonaligned states. The Afghan invasion
                        has already embarrassed Moscow’s Cuban surrogates and caused Havana’s
                        withdrawal from consideration for a seat on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">According to a
                            news report, January 6, Cuba concluded “the Soviet intervention of
                            Afghanistan has started a landslide of votes for Havana’s opponent,
                            Colombia.” (“Cuba Ends Fight for Seat on Council,” <hi rend="italic">New
                                York Times</hi>, January 7, 1980, p. A2)</note></p>
                    <p>From Moscow’s point of view, the most worrisome potential consequence of its
                        Afghanistan adventure is the prospect of closer Sino-American security
                        cooperation. Soviet actions in Afghanistan will make the soon-to-resume
                        Sino-Soviet talks even more difficult. Moscow will also be watching for
                        signs of a more aggressive Chinese stance toward Vietnam now that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has, for the first time, invaded a
                        country that borders China.</p>
                    <p>The foreign policy fallout of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan will be
                        mixed. A long-term Soviet presence in Afghanistan and continued involvement
                        in the conflict will probably lead to increasingly unfavorable
                        reverberations for Moscow’s standing throughout the Islamic world,
                        particularly among Afghanistan’s neighbors who are opposed to a change in
                        the balance of power in the area and are apprehensive about the dangers
                        inherent in Soviet-American rivalry being played out in their region.
                        Indeed, the longer the Soviets remain in Afghanistan, the greater the
                        temptation will be for Moscow to take more active steps to influence the
                        behavior of Iran and Pakistan. Similarly, a long involvement in Afghanistan
                        might alter the terms of detente in a way that could tempt the Soviets to
                        challenge US interests in the Middle East and the Caribbean more
                        aggressively.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>The overthrow of the Afghan Government and occupation of that country by
                        Soviet military forces represents a profoundly disturbing threat to the
                        stability of the region and, most directly, to the security of Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, it is essential that there be no misunderstanding as
                        to the commitment of the United States to the security and territorial
                        integrity of Pakistan. The 1959 Agreement for Cooperation between the United
                        States and Pakistan represents a firm commitment between our two governments
                        which remains fully valid. Its provisions are directly relevant to a Soviet
                        threat via Afghanistan. I want you to know that the United States intends to
                        stand by its commitments under this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly concerned with the crescendo of charges and threats
                        emanating from certain quarters regarding the presence in your country of
                        hundreds of thousands of unfortunate refugees fleeing oppression and
                        violence in Afghanistan. In these circumstances, the United States
                        reiterates that it considers the Durand Line to be the international
                        frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan and that our actions under the
                        1959 Agreement will reflect that fact.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">On the

                        the various retributive measures announced by the President have been
                        twofold. First, military operations in Afghanistan have continued with
                        increasing evidence that the force buildup has not abated. Second, Moscow
                        has launched a propaganda blitz, accusing the US, with Chinese and Egyptian
                        complicity, of meddling in Afghan internal affairs, arming and training the
                        insurgents, and supporting Pakistan in its assistance to rebel factions.
                        Presumably the Soviets will take steps to ameliorate any shortfall in grain,
                        fish, and technology requirements by finding alternative sources of supply
                        or buying through a third country “cutout.” There are retaliatory actions
                        against the US and allies available to the Soviets in such areas as Berlin,
                        Cuba and elsewhere; however, these do not appear too likely in the near term
                        given the operational success of their occupation of Afghanistan.</p>

                        into Kabul on 25 December. When completed on the 27th, the airhead consisted
                        of an airborne force equivalent to two regiments. Another proximate airborne
                        regiment had previously been deployed to Bagram airbase north of Kabul in
                        early December. The airborne forces in Kabul initiated the coup d’etat in
                        the capital on the night of the 27th while some Bagram elements may have
                        deployed north to secure the major road leading from the Soviet border.</p>

                        government facilities, the Radio Afghanistan compound, and Darulaman Palace

                        after brief firefights succeeded in securing and disarming the troops. In
                        addition, airborne forces moved to secure Afghan army garrisons ringing the
                        capital. <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and his entourage were
                        reportedly executed that night.</p>

                        rifle divisions poised on the border apparently invaded on two axes. One
                        division moved south to Kabul along the road previously secured by the
                        Bagram forces and arrived in the city on 29 December. The other division
                        crossed into western Afghanistan and occupied the key Afghan cities of Herat
                        and Shindand. These are the only confirmed ground force divisions in
                        Afghanistan. However, elements of two additional divisions may now have
                        entered the country—one along each of the previously used axes of
                        advance.</p>

                            declassified</hi>]. It appears that both divisions conducted a tactical
                        road march south to their respective objectives with the western division
                        reportedly encountering some resistance in Herat. The rise [<hi rend="italic">use</hi>] of reconnaissance aircraft in support of ground
                        formations’ advance along major routes has been confirmed as has the use of
                        helicopters for medical evacuation missions. As yet, there is no reliable
                        evidence of heliborne assaults or air strikes in conjunction with the Soviet
                        campaign and, indeed, no indications of active Soviet counterinsurgency
                        operations have been noted to date. As a footnote, despite the lack of hard
                        evidence, it is believed some airborne elements may have been flown into key
                        outlying cities during the 25–27 December airlift to secure important
                        airfields prior to the subsequent arrival of regular combat units.</p>

                        more numerous AN–12/CUB fleet. These aircraft were drawn primarily from the

                        Far East. The actual airlift was conducted in two phases. The first phase
                        conducted on 24–25 December represented an airlift of 150–200 VTA sorties
                        into bases in the border region from the western <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. This was the relocation of major elements of an airborne
                        division. The second phase consisted of the movement of these airborne
                        forces into Kabul and possibly other key cities by an <pb n="462" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_462"/>estimated 250 VTA sorties from 25/27
                        December. During this airlift, at least two airborne regiments were
                        introduced.</p>

                        information on Soviet or Afghan casualties incurred during the coup. One
                        report cited as many as 250 Soviet casualties incident to the takeover but
                        this is unsubstantiated. Similarly, there are various reports of conflict
                        between Soviet units and dissident Afghan army troops and insurgents—all of
                        these suffer from imprecise casualty figures. All that can be responsibly
                        stated is that Soviet casualty levels are expected now to be low, resulting
                        primarily from terrorist attacks and various hit-and-run attacks by the
                        rebels. These figures should increase as the Soviet units become more
                        actively engaged in combat operations.</p>

                        disloyal troops and intense rebel pressure. Airborne and commando battalions
                        attached from Kabul since November are also threatening to refuse to

                        police forces in the city are refusing to work, and the town has been
                        virtually shut down for 3 days. Herat and other large cities have been
                        placed under a strict night curfew to avert the danger of civil disorder.
                        Herat is of particular concern because it was the scene of a bloody
                        anti-Soviet military and civilian uprising last March. East of Kabul, both
                        the 11th Division at Jalalabad and the 9th Mountain Division at Asadabad
                        have experienced severe desertion problems. In each division at least one

                    <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> opened by welcoming <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> and noting that he had had a good
                        series of communications with President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> noted that the Soviet invasion is a major adverse
                        development, an ominous change in Soviet practice. He was pleased at the
                        support that he had received from the American people for his responses, and
                        from nations all around the world. The President recalled that we had again
                        reaffirmed the validity of the 1959 agreement, and our recognition of the
                        Durand line as the international boundary between Pakistan and <pb n="466" facs="0511" xml:id="pg_466"/>Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">See <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> He pointed out that
                        we had put together with great care a strong military and economic aid
                        package, and that some of our top officials will be going to Europe in the

                            visited Brussels, Bonn, Paris, London, and Rome January 14–16. After he
                            met with the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on January 15, he noted
                            that he was “encouraged” by the progress made toward agreeing on the
                            response to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. (Flora Lewis, “Gains

                            A10)</note> He said that he believed the European leaders were already
                        positively inclined and he would appreciate <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName>’s guidance on the degree to which our efforts in all of
                        these regards should be made public. He noted, of course, that the
                        dimensions of our aid program will have to become public as soon as we
                        present it to Congress. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> reviewed various measures that we have
                        taken to increase our strength on a permanent basis, including the
                        revitalization of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the establishment
                        of important relations with China, and measured development of Diego Garcia,
                        where the British are now more willing to be forthcoming on expansion. He
                        noted, however, that our relations with India have become difficult
                        following the elections. He told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> that he had had a nonsubstantive telephone
                        conversation with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> and
                        that he was disconcerted, although not especially surprised by the speech
                        which the Indian Permanent Representative had made on Afghanistan in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly.<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s phone
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> took
                            place earlier that day. The January 11 statement by the Indian Permanent
                            Representative was relayed in telegram 714 from New Delhi, January 12.
                            The major points of the statement, as reported in the telegram, included
                            the assertion that the Soviet Union was in Afghanistan “at the
                            invitation of the previous Afghan Government and with the agreement of
                            the present government,” that “India has had assurances from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that Soviets will withdraw on
                            request by Afghan Government,” and “discussion in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> of an issue involving the sovereign
                            rights of the Afghan people would not be helpful.” (National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D800020–0906)</note> The speech sounded as if it had come from East
                        Germany, Czechoslovakia, or North Vietnam. He told <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> that we plan to send an emissary to
                        India to attempt to convince Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> of our attitude towards her country, and to point out
                        that we will be making commitments to Pakistan. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said we trust that Pakistan is
                        determined to defend its territory. We will report back on matters of
                        concern to you after we have talked to India and our European allies. The
                        Chinese Foreign Minister will soon be visiting Pakistan and I hope you will
                        share with us, to the proper extent, the results of that visit. (S)</p>
                    <p><pb n="467" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_467"/>We are talking not about a transient
                        commitment. We value our relations and are aware of our interest in
                        Southwest Asia. Our position on nuclear explosives is clear and I hope you
                        will relay our concern to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. Movement on this is not a prerequisite for cooperation,
                        but our long-term relations will be substantially affected by the question
                        of nuclear explosives. We hope that you could promise not to test during the
                        administration of President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. Such
                        a pledge could be kept confidential; we would share it only with a few
                        Congressmen. It could, however, be a prerequisite to the granting of aid. A
                        future explosion by Pakistan would be a matter of deep concern to the United
                        States. The nuclear question, then, is no longer an insurmountable obstacle,
                        but it remains important. (S)</p>

                        thanked the President for taking time to see him, and for reaffirming the
                        American commitment under the 1959 Agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> said that no matter how difficult the
                        situation might be, it was always a pleasure to deal with Secretary

                        agreed that there was a need to continue the discussion between the two
                        sides. He referred to an Army-Air Force-Navy team which would meet with
                        American counterparts to review the threat to Pakistan and discuss its
                            requirements.<note n="6" xml:id="d163fn6">A meeting on this topic
                            between senior officials of the Pakistani military and the Department of
                            Defense took place earlier in the Department of State. A cable

                        the Pakistani requirements were large because their Western Frontier is
                        nearly undefended. All the troops are in the East because Indian forces are
                        massed along that border. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName></hi> said
                        he had received fairly explicit and satisfactory reassurances about our
                        security guarantee. He noted that in the past there had been some question
                        of the applicability of these guarantees, and wondered if an executive
                        agreement would be as effective as a treaty. He said that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had given him the benefit
                        of his views and that he was glad to hear from the President that the
                        American commitment to the region is permanent. He stressed that if Pakistan
                        does face up to the Soviet threat, and once again is left high and dry by
                        the United States, this would pose a great danger to the very existence of
                        Pakistan. Pakistan is now a front-line state; its concerns are legitimate
                        and its demands are not exaggerated. He hoped for some possible
                        strengthening of the 1959 Agreement, particularly one that would be binding
                        on future administrations. (S)</p>

                        impossible to put any treaty to the Senate before the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Agreement was considered, and that

                    <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName></hi> observed that a move of Pakistani forces to the

                        will be helpful in getting support for Pakistan from other countries and
                        asked that <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> give <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> exactly the same message that had been
                        given to him. We will stand with Pakistan. Pakistan is vital to United
                        States’ security, and the 1959 Agreement is permanent. It is a pleasure to
                        have Pakistan as a friend. We both now have an opportunity to repair the
                        doubtful relations of the past. Please take to heart the American people’s
                        concern about the spread of nuclear weapons; this concern is not directed
                        particularly at Pakistan, but also a series of other countries who are at
                        the nuclear threshold. (S)</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Leaving ancillary events aside, there are basically only two results possible
                        in Afghanistan:</p>
                    <p>—Either the Soviets mop up the insurgents in short order, control the passes,
                        and exert sufficient force to seal the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan border; or</p>
                    <p>—Moscow runs into more difficulties than I presently anticipate and becomes
                        enmeshed in a long-range counter-insurgency war in Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                    <p>In either case, unless the Pakistanis can be prevailed upon by Moscow to
                        close the Afghan border to the insurgents, it is almost a certainty that at
                        some point the Soviets will feel compelled to conduct cross-border
                        operations into Pakistan aimed at wiping out the military value of the
                        refugee camps. In such an event, the pressures on us to react forcefully
                        will be enormous. (S)</p>
                    <p>In fact, the Soviets now seem to be laying the propaganda groundwork for
                        future attacks against Afghan rebel bases. As I pointed out in my Evening
                        Report of January 9, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] analysts are convinced that the Soviets will be
                        attacking such bases in the near future.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">Not
                            found.</note> Certainly Soviet military commanders in Afghanistan will
                        be pointing out to Moscow that allowing the refugee camps to remain
                        untouched would mean that the insurgency could go on, fueled by outside
                        forces, perhaps for decades. There is no country within the Soviet orbit
                        where Moscow has allowed an insurgency to continue. It is extremely doubtful
                        that Afghanistan will be an exception to this rule. (S)</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, a cross-border operation into Pakistan is only one, and not the
                        most serious, of the contingencies which we will be facing in the next
                        several months. Neither a Soviet move into Northern Iran nor a Vietnamese
                        thrust into Thailand can be ruled out with any degree of certainty. (S)</p>
                    <p><pb n="470" facs="0515" xml:id="pg_470"/>Even without further provocations by
                        the Soviets, the President has called the invasion of Afghanistan the worst
                        crisis we have faced since the Second World War. But—to deal with just one
                        of the post-WW II crises—after construction of the Berlin Wall to provide
                        needed manpower draft calls were doubled and tripled, enlistments were
                        extended, and the Congress promptly and unanimously authorized the
                        mobilization of up to 250,000 men in the ready Reserves and National Guard,
                        including the activation of two full divisions and fifty-four Air Force and
                        Naval air squadrons. Some 158,000 men, Reservists and Guardsmen, mostly for
                        the Army, were actually called up; and altogether the strength of our armed
                        forces was increased by 300,000 men. Some 40,000 were sent to Europe, and
                        others were prepared for swift deployment. Six “priority divisions” in the
                        Reserves were made ready for quick mobilization, and three Regular Army
                        divisions engaged in training were converted to full combat readiness.
                        (U)</p>
                    <p>Along with the manpower, the Berlin build-up provided enough equipment and
                        ammunition to supply the new troops, enough sealift and airlift to transport
                        them, and enough airpower to cover ground combat. Some three hundred
                        tactical fighter aircraft, more than 100,000 tons of equipment, and several
                        thousand tanks, jeeps, armored personnel carriers and other vehicles were
                        placed in position on the European continent, and still more on “floating
                        depot” ships. (U)</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets carried on with further objectionable actions in Afghanistan
                        and adjacent regions, unless we reacted with the same kind of vigor that
                        President Kennedy did, i.e., actions stronger than anything so far being
                        contemplated, the press would almost certainly begin to make unfavorable
                        comparisons between our reactions to Berlin and Afghanistan and try to paint
                        the President as weak and ineffectual. (S)</p>
                    <p>I believe we should be staffing-out the pros and cons of the following
                        specific options which the President could use at some later date, in the
                        face of almost inevitable further Soviet objectionable action:</p>
                    <p>—Calling up the Reserves.</p>

                    <p>—Providing a meaningful military and economic assistance package to Pakistan
                        (the current package is entirely inadequate).</p>
                    <p>—Boycotting, partially boycotting, or moving the venue of the Olympics (no

                        attention in the United States—it was a crumb <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and Nixon threw the Soviets—but it has language
                        supporting our position in this instance, and is very important to the
                        Soviets. They cite it frequently and have used it internally to convince the
                        Soviet public that relations with the US are under control.)<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">No renunciation of the Declaration of Principles

                    <p>Whether the disparate Afghan insurgent groups can stand up to the Soviet
                        military occupation forces depends on the degree of Soviet commitment.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets appear to have three options:</p>
                    <quote><p>(1) To use Soviet forces primarily to secure urban areas and major
                            roads and to rebuild the Afghan Army for the role of pacification in the
                            countryside.</p>
                        <p>(2) To use Soviet forces directly in counter-insurgency operations in the
                            countryside as a supplement to the Afghan Army wherever most needed.</p>
                        <p>(3) To use Soviet forces as the primary element in crushing the
                            insurgents throughout the country.</p></quote>
                    <p>We believe that the Soviets already have sufficient forces (80,000 troops) in
                        Afghanistan to fulfill option 1, and in fact now control the urban areas and
                        key roads. The longer task of rebuilding the Afghan Army to the point where
                        it can challenge the insurgents in the countryside will be much more
                        difficult. Even before the Babrak coup, the Afghan Army was well below
                        strength due to desertions and low morale. If the Afghan Army cannot regain
                        more of the initiative against the insurgents soon, the Army may continue to
                        disintegrate and rural territory continue to fall to the insurgents.</p>
                    <p>We believe, then, that the Soviets will be drawn into an active
                        counterinsurgency role as in option 2. <hi rend="italic">The recent
                            establishment of General <persName corresp="#p_SMS_1">Sokolov</persName>’s headquarters in Kabul and of a tactical air
                            headquarters at Bagram airfield would seem to point in this
                            direction.</hi> The introduction of more airpower, especially transport
                        and gunship helicopters and close air support aircraft, or the availability
                        of the latter from nearby airfields in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, would presage such intentions.</p>
                    <p>A key question is whether limited Soviet counterinsurgency operations under
                        this option would intimidate the insurgents into at least quiescence. The
                        insurgents have probably not faced the ruthlessness with which the Soviets
                        will destroy their villages, mosques, and farm<pb n="473" facs="0518" xml:id="pg_473"/>lands, and have not been subjected to the massive
                        firepower of helicopter gunships, jet bombers, and tactical missiles that
                        the Soviets have on hand and will use.</p>
                    <p>We tend to believe that the insurgents are sufficiently mobile, elusive, and
                        determined not to be cowed by such Soviet tactics, at least in the central,
                        northern, and eastern portions of Afghanistan. In most of this area, the
                        base altitude is about 15,000 feet. Helicopter performance is poor and
                        aircraft are inhibited.</p>
                    <p>In the southern and southwestern areas, however, the terrain is generally
                        flat and accessible. Here even the existing levels of Soviet forces are
                        probably adequate to overpower the insurgents and establish firm control.
                        Thus the insurgency is not likely to prevent the Soviets from establishing a
                        secure base area from which they could conduct covert operations,
                        infiltration, or military operations against either Iranian or Pakistani
                        Baluchistan or both.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets and the Afghan Army cannot establish adequate control over the
                        mountainous countryside, the Soviets will be faced with the decision as to
                        introducing substantially larger ground forces. <hi rend="italic">The
                            Soviets have few troops left in the border area and would have to bring
                            in units from other parts of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</hi> Once these forces were in place, the Soviets could
                        move against the insurgent strongholds countrywide, relying heavily on
                        airstrikes against rebel concentrations but sending in units on foot against
                        remote rebel bases.</p>
                    <p>Such actions would probably push tens of thousands of refugees, including
                        insurgents, across the border into Pakistan and Iran and force many others
                        to give up the fight. They would allow the Soviets to reduce the insurgency
                        to nuisance levels, but at a very high cost. Still, we would expect the
                        rebels to return to Afghanistan and renew the fight whenever the Soviets
                        decided to wind down their involvement.</p>

                            provided an opportunity for the United States to challenge the Kremlin’s

                            intervention in Afghanistan was the right decision. This endeavor would
                            include demonstrating that the Soviet Union had not acted in a way
                            befitting a “responsible superpower and a fit partner for negotiating
                            major arms issues and for mutually advantageous cooperation;” that the
                            intervention “gravely damaged” Soviet efforts to stymie <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Chinese cooperation, to “pacify”
                            Western Europe, and to continue “neutralizing” regional powers such as

                        been especially prominent since the Afghan crisis erupted. In alleging that
                        the US has shown itself to be “an absolutely unreliable partner” and in
                        assuring the West European governments of Moscow’s desire to continue

                        Soviet security; his failure to repeat earlier descriptions of the
                        intervention as “limited” suggests a decision to prepare the Soviet public
                        for a long, hard campaign. This impression is reinforced by his reference to
                        “tens of thousands of insurgents” in Afghanistan as well as by his claim
                        that the White House has announced “its decision to expand” aid to the
                        Afghan rebels. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                        measures. He claimed “plans for providing bread to the population will not
                        be affected by US actions,” an assertion that will be read by his audience
                        as confirmation that meat supplies will be hurt.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">In telegram 708 from Moscow, January 14, the Embassy reported “the

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>Through a carefully prepared, massively staged military intervention, the
                        Soviets have imposed a new Communist puppet government in Afghanistan and
                        have occupied the key government and population centers and the main
                        communications facilities with Soviet troops. By early January, the Soviets
                        had six divisions and over 75,000 troops inside Afghanistan—with more
                        apparently on the way—and were rapidly consolidating their control. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>We have no direct evidence of the Soviets’ expectations for the eventual
                        size, nature, and duration of their military adventure in Afghanistan, but
                        we believe that substantial Soviet forces will remain there for the
                        foreseeable future. The most likely commitment would appear to be a force of
                        some six to 10 divisions and as many as 150,000 men. Such a force could have
                        been made available within a few weeks of the beginning of the invasion, but
                        the deliberate pace of the buildup suggests that it will not be fully
                        deployed until spring, when operations can resume at full intensity. A force
                        of this size could ensure the survival of the Babrak regime, retain control
                        over major population centers and lines of communication, and conduct
                        limited pacification operations. Meanwhile, the Soviets are likely to make
                        efforts to reconstitute the Afghan Army over the next one to three years
                        with the object of making it effective enough to undertake a long-term
                        pacification effort. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In the unlikely event that the Afghan insurgency increases beyond the
                        capacity of the force described above to contain it, or if the Soviets <pb n="477" facs="0522" xml:id="pg_477"/>thought they could do the job
                        quickly, they might decide on a major pacification effort. The manpower
                        requirement for such an effort would be open-ended, probably taking far more
                        than 150,000 men. The buildup of such a force could only be accomplished
                        over a period of months. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Soviet operations, which almost certainly will combine carrot with stick, may
                        be able to intimidate or placate the insurgency to quiescence, and they can
                        certainly remove it as a potent threat to the Babrak regime. Indeed, it is
                        unlikely that even a much stronger insurgency could seriously threaten
                        either the Soviets or Babrak’s government as long as the Soviets retain
                        substantial forces in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the traditional
                        militancy and fierce independence of the rebels, coupled with the severe
                        difficulties that the mountainous Afghan countryside poses for military
                        pacification operations, probably will make it impossible for the Soviets to
                        eradicate the insurgency. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Thus, the long-term outlook for the Soviets in Afghanistan is for a continued
                        military presence with both Soviet and government forces harassed by at
                        least low-level insurgent operations. The Soviet presence could provoke the
                        insurgency to greater determination and closer cooperation. The rebels could
                        continue harassing operations for the foreseeable future, withdrawing into
                        high-mountain redoubts or to sanctuaries across the border to evade
                        search-and-destroy operations. We can foresee almost no circumstance in
                        which the Soviets will be able to eradicate the insurgency and permanently
                        pacify the countryside, but, with a force of 150,000 men, they probably
                        could reduce the insurgency to an acceptable level of annoyance. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan is likely to be of long
                        duration. The Babrak regime is not likely to be either politically or
                        militarily secure without the Soviet presence, and rebuilding the Afghan
                        Army probably will take from one to three years. Eradication of the
                        insurgency—if it can be accomplished at all—could take some years after
                        that. In the short term, there is the threat of spillover into adjacent
                        areas of Pakistan and Iran resulting from a Soviet decision to attack or
                        pursue insurgents operating out of those countries. Given the dislocation of
                        so many Afghan refugees, the refugee camps’ potential as a source of
                        recruitment and supplies for the insurgents, and the Soviets’ publicly
                        stated rationalization of the invasion as a response to external threats,
                        the potential for spillover is high. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                        <p>1. It is unlikely that the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan constitutes
                            the preplanned first step in the implementation of a highly articulated
                            grand design for the rapid establishment of hegemonic control over all
                            of Southwest Asia. Rather than signaling the carefully timed beginning
                            of a premeditated strategic offensive, the occupation may have been a
                            reluctantly authorized response to what was perceived by the Kremlin as
                            an imminent and otherwise irreversible deterioration of its already
                            established position in a country which fell well within the <pb n="479" facs="0524" xml:id="pg_479"/>Soviet Union’s legitimate sphere of
                            influence. However, there is no reason to doubt that the Soviets covet a
                            larger sphere of influence in Southwest Asia or to suppose that their
                            decision to occupy Afghanistan was made without reference to broader
                            regional objectives. On the contrary, their willingness to incur what
                            they almost certainly anticipated would be serious costs strongly
                            suggests a belief that their occupation of Afghanistan would improve
                            their access to a number of extremely lucrative targets of opportunity
                            and might eventually lead to a highly favorable and enduring shift in
                            the regional and perhaps even global balance of power.</p>
                        <p>2. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was probably predicated on a
                            belief that Afghan resistance would prove relatively short lived. Among
                            other things, their historical experience in their own Central Asian
                            republics may have persuaded the Soviets that a strategy combining
                            military intimidation, political conciliation, and economic enticement
                            would quickly reduce resistance and enable their puppet regime to
                            acquire at least a modicum of grassroots political authority and
                            administrative control. If this turns out to be a miscalculation and
                            Afghan resistance becomes or remains persistent and widespread, the
                            Soviets could become so bogged down in guerrilla warfare that they
                            abandon any hopes of further near-term expansion. However, they are
                            unlikely to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan and might well try to
                            alleviate their problems there by intensifying pressure on or expanding
                            the conflict to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>3. In the face of intractable Afghan resistance, the Soviets are likely
                            to attribute much of the blame to direct or indirect Pakistani
                            involvement and to take what they deem to be essential deterrent and
                            retaliatory measures. These measures could include not only cross-border
                            raids by loyal Afghan and/or Soviet forces, but also extensive Soviet
                            support for anti-Pakistani tribal insurgents and intimidating demarches
                            on Islamabad by the Soviets’ Indian allies.<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">Intelligence cable 5264, prepared in the Department of Defense,
                                January 16, reported that “the Pakistanis are concerned the Soviets
                                may soon initiate military action against Afghan refugee camps
                                located along their common border with Afghanistan. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> claimed Soviet intervention in
                                Afghanistan is warranted because of the continuing Pakistani
                                training and support of Afghan insurgents.” The cable also reported
                                that the number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan had risen to 400,000
                                over the past year and could “easily” reach one million in response
                                to Soviet military action. (Carter Library, National Security
                                Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Cables File, Box 4, Afghanistan:
                                1/15/80)</note> In extremis, moreover, the Soviets might press a
                            not-too-reluctant India to join them in an all-out campaign of political
                            subversion or even in a concerted invasion. Although the inevitable
                            costs of such a drastic action might give the Soviets pause, their
                            behavior in Afghanistan (as well as the earlier escalatory behavior of
                            the United States in Vietnam-Laos-Cambodia) <pb n="480" facs="0525" xml:id="pg_480"/>suggests that they might be undeterred by anything
                            short of a credible threat of direct US military retaliation.</p>
                        <p>4. Unless their position in Afghanistan impels them to take a harsh
                            anti-Pakistani line, the Soviets are likely to give Islamabad time to
                            adjust to the “realities” of its new situation and adopt a more
                            conciliatory approach to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In
                            this case, the Soviets are more likely to let their presence in and
                            growing control over Afghanistan speak for themselves than they are to
                            underscore Pakistani vulnerabilities by issuing explicit threats. While
                            exercising such self-restraint, moreover, the Soviets are likely to
                            offer the Pakistanis substantial inducements to distance themselves from
                            the United States and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. Although
                            they will have to guard against jeopardizing their close relations with
                            India in the process, the Soviets are likely to try to woo the
                            Pakistanis not only with pledges of noninterference and offers of
                            economic aid but also with offers of at least limited military
                            assistance and promises to use their good offices to keep
                            Pakistani-Indian relations on an even keel. Should India take serious
                            umbrage at such initiatives, the Soviets might temporarily take a less
                            forthcoming line. But they would also be mindful of the extreme
                            improbability of a markedly anti-Soviet realignment of Indian policy and
                            might be willing to expend a substantial amount of the capital they have
                            accumulated in Delhi in order to secure Pakistani acceptance of the
                            Soviet Union’s growing regional influence.</p>
                        <p>5. If Islamabad were to prove insufficiently responsive to their
                            blandishments, the Soviets would probably use less subtle means to try
                            to encourage greater “realism.” As already indicated, the means at their
                            disposal would include military intimidation, political subversion, and
                            tribal insurrection, as well as the activation of longstanding Afghan
                            and Indian claims on Pakistani territory. If these tactics also fail to
                            produce the desired results, the Soviets might eventually conclude that
                            it was advisable to allow Pakistan an interlude in which to work out its
                            own destiny. A decision to this effect would seem particularly
                            appropriate if attempts to escalate the pressure on Islamabad seemed
                            likely to increase US involvement in Pakistan and to limit Soviet
                            opportunities elsewhere in the region. Such an interlude would not
                            necessarily be long lasting, however, and could come to an abrupt halt
                            if subsequent developments expose additional Pakistani
                            vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>6. Of all of the objectives that their occupation of Afghanistan may have
                            placed within easier Soviet reach, a pro-Soviet Iran is almost surely
                            the most tantalizing. Although the Soviet occupation of an Islamic
                            country has undoubtedly confirmed and strengthened the anti-Communist
                            sentiments of Iran’s fervently religious ruling elite, it has also
                            emplaced Soviet forces on Iran’s eastern as well as its northern border
                            and has created possibilities for direct large-scale Soviet aid <pb n="481" facs="0526" xml:id="pg_481"/>to Baluchi as well as to Azari
                            and Kurdish separatist movements. Furthermore, it has done so at a time
                            when Iran is going through a paroxysm of anti-American hysteria and may
                            be on the brink of political, social, and economic chaos. Since this is
                            also a time when the Soviets are about to encounter significant
                            shortfalls in domestic energy production, it seems probable that the
                            expansion of its influence over Iran will rank at or near the top of the
                            Kremlin’s hierarchy of regional priorities.</p>
                        <p>7. Although the possibility cannot be excluded, it does not seem likely
                            that the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan will turn out to have been a
                            dress rehearsal for an impending gala performance in Iran. Unlike
                            Afghanistan, Iran is clearly too important to the West to make the risk
                            of a counterintervention seem negligible, and the exercised American
                            reaction to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan has probably convinced
                            even the Kremlin’s most unreconstructed hawks that a frontal attack on
                            Iran could lead to a full-fledged military showdown with the United
                            States. However, fear of such a showdown will not lead the Kremlin to
                            forsake its ambitions or prevent it from pursuing them by more
                            circuitous means. At the margin, apprehension that any important Soviet
                            breakthrough in Iran would elicit a determined US military reaction may
                            exercise a restraining influence, but the Soviets will probably still
                            have extensive room for maneuver in a situation in which American
                            options are severely circumscribed and Iranian vulnerabilities are very
                            large.</p>
                        <p>8. At least for the immediate future, the Soviets are likely to make
                            assiduous efforts to improve their relations with the <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> regime. Among other things,
                            they will probably signal their willingness to be supportive
                            diplomatically and to provide Tehran with economic and military aid.
                            Such overtures will not prevent the Soviets from entrenching themselves
                            on Iran’s Afghan border, cultivating their contacts with anti-Persian
                            nationalist movements, and supporting the <gloss target="#t_Tudeh_1">Tudeh</gloss>’s efforts to build up its organizational
                            infrastructure and penetrate the country’s governing elites. Instead of
                            flaunting these activities, however, the Kremlin will probably try to
                            keep them inconspicuous and take special precautions to neutralize their
                            potentially provocative effects.</p>
                        <p>9. Although the Soviets can have few illusions about the possibility of
                            altering the fundamentally anti-Communist ideological tenets of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> regime, they
                            probably do foresee a possibility of growing <gloss target="#t_Tudeh_1">Tudeh</gloss> influence over current governmental policy and of a
                            significant <gloss target="#t_Tudeh_1">Tudeh</gloss> role in a more
                            secular and “progressive” post-<persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> regime. The early emergence and smooth
                            stabilization of such a non-Communist but Communist-tinged regime
                            probably represents the Soviets’ preferred outcome to the <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> succession, since they could
                            then <pb n="482" facs="0527" xml:id="pg_482"/>look forward to the
                            establishment of much more intimate Soviet-Iranian relations which it
                            would be extremely difficult for the United States or other foreign
                            countries to disrupt. Outside powers would be hard pressed for an excuse
                            to interfere with a legitimate and viable Iranian regime, and any
                            credible threat of hostile action on their part could provide the
                            Soviets with a welcome opportunity to extend protection to a friendly
                            neighboring country which also shared a common border with the Soviets’
                            Afghan allies. While the experience of President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, et al., would doubtless make many
                            Iranian leaders question the wisdom of signing a Treaty of Friendship
                            and Mutual Assistance with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                            the external (and/or internal) pressures upon them might make their
                            position seem too precarious to allow them any choice.</p>
                        <p>10. Given the extremely remote prospect of an early pro-American
                            reorientation of Iranian policy, the Soviets would probably not attempt
                            to overthrow or subvert a post-<persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> regime which denied the <gloss target="#t_Tudeh_1">Tudeh</gloss> access to position of influence
                            power. However, if they were persuaded that such a regime was developing
                            real durability and becoming so anti-Communist that their potential
                            leverage in Tehran was in jeopardy (e.g., as a result of a credible
                            threat to crush the <gloss target="#t_Tudeh_1">Tudeh</gloss>), the
                            Soviets would probably not hesitate to take strong counteraction. Unless
                            it were firmly convinced that such behavior would boomerang, the Kremlin
                            might well resort not only to stern diplomatic protests but also to
                            military intimidation and even, if necessary, to the encouragement and
                            support of intense centrifugal pressure on Tehran by anti-Persian
                            nationalist forces. So long as they themselves stopped short of direct
                            military intervention, the Soviets would probably discount the
                            possibility of US military action to save the incumbent regime. If, as
                            also seems probable, they were highly skeptical about the likelihood
                            and/or efficacy of US nonmilitary responses to a possible request by
                            Tehran for help, the Soviets might well risk the possibility that Tehran
                            could successfully resist their pressure and become militantly
                            anti-Soviet for the sake of the probability that it would bow to their
                            pressure or be replaced by a more accommodating successor.</p>
                        <p>11. Unless they become convinced that Iran was otherwise almost certain
                            to become a US client or was caught in the throes of an irreversible
                            process of fragmentation and disintegration, the Soviets are not likely
                            to become wholehearted supporters of any of the country’s
                            ethnonationalist secessionist or independence movements. If they were so
                            convinced, however, the Soviets would probably jettison Tehran with
                            alacrity and encourage the formation of Soviet-backed provisional
                            governments in Iranian Azarbayjan, Kordestan, Baluchestan, Khuzestan,
                            etc. Although the Kremlin would recognize that such a patent effort to
                            establish Soviet controlled mini-states could precipitate a US military
                            intervention (presumably to try to preserve the integrity of Iran but
                                <pb n="483" facs="0528" xml:id="pg_483"/>possibly—and in a possible
                            de facto and ad hoc alliance with a severely chastened Iraq—to simply
                            occupy Khuzestan), it might well try to deter such an intervention by a
                            preemptive intervention of its own. Moreover, if they felt that their
                            only other real choice was acquiescence in what they would almost
                            certainly envision as a more or less permanent US military presence on
                            or close to their southern border, the Soviets might not be averse to
                            confronting the United States in an area in which the local population
                            was strongly anti-American and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could benefit from many logistical advantages.<note n="5" xml:id="d168fn5">In a January 18 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OWE_1">Odom</persName> laid out three strategies for

                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary. Kabul remains quiet but tense as the Soviet profile, while
                        lowered, remains visible. The ruling Parcham faction is trying to broaden
                        its bases of support through a Fatherland Front. There are indications that
                        even the Parchamists are splitting among pro- and anti-Soviet presence
                        elements. The government-controlled media continue to attack the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and President <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> has made a strong pitch for Afghan-Iranian
                        solidarity against American “imperialism.” He pledged that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> would not permit Afghanistan to be used as
                        a base of operations against Iran (ignoring the presence of over 25,000
                        Soviet troops near the Afghan side of the two nations’ border) and expected
                        Iran to assume a “reciprocal” stance. The Afghan economy appears to have
                        come to a standstill, at least in regard to development activity and
                        commerce. Although foreign exchange reserves are <pb n="484" facs="0529" xml:id="pg_484"/>high, wheat, the staff of life, is in short supply and
                        is becoming dearer in Kabul markets. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. As of mid-afternoon Wednesday, January 16, Kabul remains quiet but
                        somewhat tense. The quietness reflects the absence of noted incidents; the
                        tension reflects widespread unease and anger at the continued Soviet
                        occupation of the country. Although the Soviet presence is not visible on
                        every street corner, the passing of a truckload of armed Soviet soldiers,
                        the presence of a Soviet soldier (military policeman?) at the entrance to an
                        Air Force installation near the Kabul Airport, the increased number of
                        Soviet civilians seen living in Kabul’s Karteh Seh and Karteh Chahar areas
                        (near the Soviet Embassy) all serve to remind Afghans and other observers
                        that the Soviets are very much on the scene. (This is to say nothing of the
                        curfew hours when Soviet troopers reportedly take over much of the guard
                        responsibilities at many <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        installations.)</p>
                    <p>4. The ruling Parchamist faction of the People’s Democratic Party of
                        Afghanistan has made an attempt to broaden its bases of support through the
                        cooption of some non-partisan, prominent Afghans, of some former Khalqi
                        officials, and of officials from the Daoud and King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir</persName> eras, in an effort to form a
                        “Fatherland Front,” presumably at Soviet urging. (The Soviets had reportedly
                        urged unsuccessfully the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime to
                        broaden, rather than narrow, its bases of support last year.)</p>
                    <p>5. Despite the recent Parchamist effort to form its Fatherland Front, there
                        are indications that splits are occurring within Parcham, as well as within
                        Khalqi, circles over the issue of Soviet domination. If such indications
                        prove true, it would appear that Afghan nationalism is a force to be
                        reckoned with, even within President <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName>’s Parcham faction. There are also rumors repeat rumors
                        that Babrak himself is growing unhappy with the degree of Soviet control of
                        his government.</p>
                    <p>6. Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>-controlled <hi rend="italic">Kabul New Times</hi> maintains its incessant anti-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and anti-Western drumbeats.</p>
                    <p>7. Babrak has, however, made an overture to Iran’s <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> in a publicized note to the
                        latter, carried in the <hi rend="italic">Times’</hi> January 14 edition.
                        Babrak charged that “certain Iranian men and circles . . . have been doing
                        vile propaganda and are engaged in unfriendly and unbrotherly activities at
                        the instigation of American world imperialism . . . against the
                        revolutionary change brought about by the Moslem, freedom-loving and brave
                        people of Afghanistan . . .” Babrak assured <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> that the present <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> leadership wishes to have “most cordial relations based on
                        Islamic brotherhood with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Babrak pledged that
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> “will never allow anybody to use
                        our soil as a base against (the) Islamic revolution of Iran and against the
                            <pb n="485" facs="0530" xml:id="pg_485"/>interests of the fraternal
                        Iranian people. And we expect our Iranian brethren to assume a reciprocal
                        stance.” (Comment: We are unaware of any Iranian forces lined up on their
                        side of the Afghan-Iranian frontier, whereas upwards of 25,000 Soviet troops
                        are near that border.)</p>
                    <p>8. We have been deluged by American (and other) journalists for whom we have
                        given background, unattributed press briefings. One of the issues upon which
                        those representatives have focussed is the Soviet rationale for beefing up
                        their military presence on the Iranian-Afghan border. It is clear that many
                        of them suspect that the Soviets may have designs on Iran.</p>
                    <p>9. Economically, Afghanistan seems to be more or less at a standstill. There
                        is little or no development activity going on in the country at present. In
                        Kabul, commerce is dead, according to our Afghan contacts. Commercial
                        imports declined sharply in the late summer, owing partially to Pakistani
                        measures blocking re-exports (smuggling) of tires, textiles and other
                        imported commodities to that country, and have reportedly remained down.
                        Foreign exchange reserves stood at about dols 420 million as of
                        mid-December, according to a source with excellent contacts in the Finance
                        Ministry, reflecting both the decline in commercial imports and a relatively
                        high rate of exports during most of 1979. We lack data whether there has
                        been a decline in reserves since the December 27 Soviet invasion; we suspect
                        there has not been yet.</p>
                    <p>10. Wheat, the Afghan staff of life, is becoming both scarcer and very much
                        dearer in the Kabul bazaars. Bazaar merchants attribute this development
                        both to the problem of bringing wheat in from the producing provinces as a
                        result of the Soviet intervention, and to hoarding on the part of Kabulites.
                        There is also a strong rumor that the anti-Soviet protest strikes, which
                        have reportedly occurred in Kandahar and Herat, may spread to Kabul within
                        the next fortnight.</p>
                    <p>11. Reports continue to reach Kabul sporadically about clashes between
                        insurgents and Soviets in various provincial areas. An Afghan source, who is
                        believed to report accurately what he hears, spoke recently to a merchant
                        who had come to Kabul last week from Doshi (about mid-way between Kabul and
                        Baglan on the road to the north). The merchant swore on the Koran that he
                        had seen a band of rebels near Doshi chanting death to the Russians and

                        ridiculed in Kabul and has further degraded his popular standing. The press
                        conference, aired on local radio and television, reinforced the widely held
                        view that Babrak is a Soviet puppet. The session reportedly was terminated

                        would like Washington to have his “informal and preliminary” assessment of
                        initial <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> reaction to aid package. Fuller
                        and more formal <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> reaction would be

                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> said that initial
                        reaction of government leaders was one of disappointment. Considering the
                        immensity of the threat, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> offer of $400
                        million viewed as inadequate to meet the situation in terms of the kinds of
                        military equipment that Pakistan required, $200 million would not go very
                        far, particularly if one took into account requirements such as high
                        performance aircraft. He had also discussed offer of $200 million in
                        economic assistance with Economics Minister Ghulam Ishaq, who felt that this
                        amount would not go very far in meeting Pakistan’s needs, particularly with
                        questions of debt rescheduling still hanging over their heads. However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName> added, aid package
                        more inadequate in regard to military needs.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> also concerned about degree of
                        American resolve, since already the “liberal” press in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is attacking provision of assistance to

                            relayed comments by Pakistani Air Chief Marshall Shamim, a “Zia protégé
                            and supporter,” who “welcomed the prospect of US military aid for

                            with the MLA, Shamim acknowledged that US aid could have a negative
                            impact and would inhibit the emergence of a democratic political system

                        is fear of Indo-Soviet alliance against Pakistan. He had learned on good
                        authority that visit to Moscow by Indian defense team (sent by caretaker
                        government) had resulted in firm Soviet offer of $2 billion in arms.
                        Pakistan wanted to reach an understanding with <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> on response to Soviet expansion, and <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> had authorized Lord <persName corresp="#p_CLAC_1">Carrington</persName> to convey this view to Indian

                        offer could go a long way to explain pro-Soviet statement made prior to

                        which should have dictated a negative Indian vote on resolution. Indian

                        to India had been made. Ambassador Bajpai had brought message from <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> accepting President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s congratulations on her election and
                        proposing visit to Islamabad by Indian Foreign Secretary early in February.
                        Proposal had been accepted.</p>
                    <p>6. In response, I said that “preliminary reaction” would be immediately
                        transmitted to Washington. In regard to doubts that Foreign Advisor
                        expressed there would be ample opportunity to discuss matters further.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> would be returning
                        to Islamabad around Jan 21 and as he was aware, Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> would be paying a visit in
                        very near future. There should be no doubt at all regarding American resolve
                        in face of Soviet aggression. Pakistan should not expect unanimity of views
                        in American press on situation. There would, of course, be comments critical
                        of Pakistan Government among reports of huge number of journalists already
                        assembled in Islamabad. More could be expected out of Tehran and we had just
                        had report foreign journalists in Kabul being expelled and many of those
                        would no doubt come here. In long run, however, Pakistan should expect to
                        benefit from world attention being focussed on Soviet aggression, and I
                        thought it would be particularly beneficial to have plight of Afghan
                        refugees given full publicity. In any case, there should be no confusion
                        over what free press may or may not say and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Govern<pb n="490" facs="0535" xml:id="pg_490"/>ment

                            deal with that situation.” The report concluded, quoting <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Carter</persName>: “Since we don’t know why the
                            Soviets invaded Afghanistan, we can’t rule out a second, third, or
                            fourth operation against other countries.” (Don Oberdorfer, “Pakistan

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> explained that the
                        purpose today is to cover a number of points, not all of them for decision,
                        but as information and recommendations to the President as a backdrop for
                        the decision he will shortly be making about our policy toward Southwest
                        Asia and the Persian Gulf region. He noted the agreement about the strategic
                        dynamics of the Soviet military move into Afghanistan expressed at the
                        previous <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">See <ref target="#d152fn16">footnote 16, Document 152</ref>.</note> the
                        consequences for Pakistan and Iran, and also the importance of Soviet
                        influence in Yemen and Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> also added that the
                        Soviet publication “New Times” has issued a call for all Communist states
                        and parties to seize new <pb n="492" facs="0537" xml:id="pg_492"/>revolutionary opportunities created by the present political conditions in
                        the world, disturbing evidence of present Soviet policy directions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Assistance to Pakistan</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> commented that the
                        President’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>
                        went as well as could be expected.<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">See <ref target="#d163">Document 163</ref>.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> asked how we will deal with the
                        situation if the Pakistanis insist they want $1 billion in aid while we only
                        offered $400 million. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> predicted that they will take our $400 million and
                        complain, not reject our aid.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked about the French
                        willingness to sell the Mirage aircraft to Pakistan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> reported that the French will
                        probably supply the Mirage. As a next step, it will be discussed at the
                        Political Directors Meeting in London on January 24th. State will push
                        France to make a decision by then.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> raised the question of
                        American A–7 aircraft for Pakistan. It was pointed out that the Pakistanis
                        did not ask for them. Rather they asked that they be supplied with aircraft
                        sufficient to protect themselves against the Soviet air threat, implying, of
                        course, for the need for the US F–16 or the Mirage. The A–7, as Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> pointed out, would be
                        very useful in a ground support role along the Western frontier.
                        Furthermore, because the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has a large
                        number, nearly 700, it can undoubtedly spare 30 or 40. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> agreed the Pakistanis might be
                        willing to buy some A–7s.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Consortium</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked for Defense’s
                        proposal for a division of labor among the members of the military
                        consortium. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> submitted
                        a paper showing which countries can produce what categories of military
                        equipment. The issue of who pays remains to be solved, he added. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> noted that according to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>, the Saudis promised
                        Pakistan $800 million for military purchases over a year ago but have not
                        yet delivered. We should press the Saudis to make the promise good.</p>
                    <p>Concerning Japan, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> has
                        instructed Phil Habib to ask the Japanese for $400 million for the
                        consortium. They may give less, but <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> feels we should ask for that much. We will get little
                        from Britain and France, he continued, but the French should be willing to
                        sell them aircraft and the British will certainly be willing to sell tanks
                        and tank guns. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> added
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, France, and Germany can
                        provide anti-tank weapons, much needed for insurgency and defense. <pb n="493" facs="0538" xml:id="pg_493"/>It was also pointed out that the
                        Pakistanis want foreign assistance for building a communications
                        infrastructure on their western front.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked if we need a big
                        consortium figure for public and political effect such as $1 billion.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> observed that one to
                        one and a half billion dollars for equipment spread over three years could
                        be absorbed effectively by the Pakistanis; therefore, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s figure is about right. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> added that we must
                        avoid a figure which is so high that we are open to criticism that we are
                        “saturating” Pakistan with arms the same way we did Iran.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> added that we need a
                        military equipment package and a concept for a division of labor which we
                        can propose to the allies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> suggested that this be done at the upcoming Political
                        Directors Meeting on January 24. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> agreed; we must supplement our delegation with
                        technical teams sufficiently competent to make concrete decisions on both
                        funds and equipment.</p>

                    <p>—State will press France on the Mirage aircraft.</p>

                        the Political Directors as a proposal for a division of labor.</p>
                    <p>—To fund the consortium, we will press the Japanese for $400 million and the
                        Saudis for $800 million which, combined with our $400 million, should be
                        above $1 billion.</p>
                    <p>—Britain and France will be encouraged to supply specific military
                        equipment.</p>

                        so clearly imply our previous ties to the Shah that it will provoke

                        fail to achieve the political effect in the region for which it is intended.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> observed that we must
                        simply accept the cost of a possible <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> statement because our vital interests in the area
                        are so great. Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> suggested omitting
                        reference to “30 years.” They accepted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s alternative language “as we have been” so that
                        a sentence in the speech might read: “The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> remains committed to an independent Iran today as it has

                        in Afghanistan “a dangerous lightning rod” and, therefore, a very difficult

                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> commented that a
                        massive insurgency at present is probably not in our best interest. Rather a
                        low-level and enduring insurgency is essential to keep the Islamic states
                        mobilized against the Soviets in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> added that <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>’s comments were probably not

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> observed that the
                        large degree of consensus on all agenda issues today may negate the need for
                        an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting with the President on the
                        same topics. All agreed and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> added that the next issue we need to discuss directly

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then added two

                    <p>1. Re Afghanistan, I also discussed our first shipment to the insurgents and
                        said we were holding the second one waiting for Pakistani clearance.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>
                            met with <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JH_1">Jordan</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> on January 16 from 11:29
                            a.m. to noon. (Carter Library, Presidential Materials, President’s Daily
                            Diary)</note> (In my meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> later, he urged me to come back to the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> quickly for permission to go on with the
                        second <pb n="496" facs="0541" xml:id="pg_496"/>tranche. He said that
                        because he felt some people were beginning to waiver in whether and how far
                        we should continue this support. I told him that I wasn’t coming back to the
                            <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>; I was going ahead with the second
                        tranche and felt that we had that authority up to $10 million. He agreed and
                        encouraged us to push the second tranche as rapidly as possible.)
                        (S/Sensitive)</p>
                    <p>2. I went on in my discussion to point out the dilemma that support to the
                        insurgents created, i.e., the more they succeeded, the more likely the
                        Soviets were to put pressure on Pakistan and that the best the insurgents
                        could hope for was a continual running sore with loss of life. The comment
                        was made that in some sense the fact that we had to funnel through Pakistan
                        was a check valve on this, and that if they thought it was resulting in too
                        much pressure on them they would slow it down or turn it off. (S)</p>
                    <p>3. There was also a discussion of the possibility of diversion of equipment
                        to Pakistani or other uses. I said I certainly thought that was likely and
                        possible and that we could not hold a real audit on this, but that
                        nonetheless it was all going to be useful. The comment was made that perhaps
                        some of our own military aid would be sent to the insurgents. I pointed out
                        that that was American equipment and we were using Soviet and hoped to keep
                        it that way so the American hand was not as blatant. That point had not been
                        registered before, that is, that we were supplying Soviet equipment. I then
                        asked that mention of thanks for the splendid cooperation of the Egyptians
                        in providing ammunition to match our Soviet weapons be given to <persName corresp="#p_MH_2">Mubarak</persName> tomorrow. (S)</p>

                    <p>1. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (<gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>)
                        Bulletin No. 9 of 1980, issued on 14 January, contained analysis of the
                        Afghanistan situation and provided Chinese Missions abroad with guidance.
                        The <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Bulletin summed up major recent
                        developments and presented the following analysis:</p>
                    <p>A. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was due partially, but significantly,
                        to hegemonistic expansionism. The year 1979 began with the Soviet invasion
                        by proxy of Kampuchea and ended with the direct Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>B. The invasion of Afghanistan revealed on a grand scale the mad adventurism
                        of the Soviet Union. This move again proved that the Soviet Union would be
                        the origin of world war and remained the primary threat to world peace.</p>
                    <p>C. The Soviet action revealed Moscow’s claimed opposition to hegemonism to be
                        false, and it proved the Soviets to be liars. It further proved the illusion
                        of signing friendship treaties with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>D. The Soviet invasion indicated the serious escalation of Soviet
                        expansionism to a new stage outside the Socialist bloc and into the Third
                        World. The move also represented an escalation from the use of Cuba and
                        other proxies to the direct involvement of Soviet forces in military
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>E. Increased vigilance and unity were required on the part of other nations
                        in the world community. These nations should be encouraged to be unafraid of
                        the Soviets.</p>
                    <p><pb n="498" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_498"/>2. The <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Bulletin provided the following guidelines to Chinese
                        Missions on the Afghanistan situation:</p>
                    <p>A. In propaganda, there should be a minimum of comment on the new Afghan
                        Government. Stress should be placed on support of the Afghan people in their
                        struggle against Soviet invaders. The new government in Kabul should not yet
                        be referred to as a Soviet puppet regime.</p>
                    <p>B. Work among host governments would vary from country to country.</p>
                    <p>(1) In Western Europe, it should be pointed out that faith can no longer be
                        placed in détente. Substantive work and measures would be required to defeat
                        Soviet moves toward war. Western Europe required better relations with the
                        Third World.</p>
                    <p>(2) In the Third World and among nonaligned nations, governments should be
                        alerted to the potential for situations in which they face “the tiger at the
                        front door and the wolf at the back door.” In other words, vigilance was
                        required against a direct Soviet invasion, as well as Soviet invasions by
                        proxy using countries such as Cuba and the Socialist Republic of
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>C. The world would also have to be alerted to the possibility of a Soviet
                        peace offensive following consolidation of Afghanistan. Moscow had done this
                        in the past to assuage ill will and lower the guard of the world.</p>

                    <p>While I have provided detailed comments to Zbig, I feel strongly enough about
                        the State of the Union speech as it now stands to make the following
                            points:<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s State of the Union Address, delivered on
                            January 23, went through several drafts. The particular version
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName> referred to was
                            not further identified and not found. Text of the final address is
                            printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, 1980–81,</hi> Book I, pp. 194–200, and in
                                <ref target="frus1977-80v01#d138"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                Policy, Document 138</ref>. In the speech, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> pointed out the challenges
                            posed by the situation in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
                            and enunciated what would become known as the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Doctrine: “Let our position be
                            absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the
                            Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital
                            interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be
                            repelled by any means necessary, including military force.”</note></p>
                    <p>1. Overall, the speech is not well-organized, is neither tough nor sharp in
                        its focus or language, and lacks coherency. It is in short “mushy”.</p>
                    <p>2. It is difficult to discern what the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> doctrine or central message is from the draft—is it
                        merely the aid to Pakistan—is it a broader statement that we will intervene
                        militarily if any nation in the area is threatened or only some and if so
                        which ones? The draft uses the phrase you aptly mentioned during our meeting
                        on the speech—that you are drawing the line, but it is unclear where the
                        line extends and what happens if it is breached. It is critically important
                        that this be clearly stated and that we stress we have the staying power to
                        protect the vital interests of the countries in the area in continued
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>3. You strongly urged during our meeting on the speech that specific bases or
                        facilities be announced and urged Zbig and Cy to expedite the necessary
                        decisions. This would be the most dramatic part of the speech—clearly
                        indicating we are stepping up our military presence in the area. Yet it is
                        stated so obtusely and vaguely in the speech that the point and its
                        significance is totally lost.</p>
                    <p><pb n="500" facs="0545" xml:id="pg_500"/>4. The sections dealing with Iran
                        badly need to be reworked:</p>
                    <p>a. Parts actually seem to embrace the revolution.</p>
                    <p>b. The tone is (even before our hostages are out): We have always liked you
                        and we still do.</p>
                    <p>c. You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> repeat for the American people the tough
                        steps already taken—cut off oil imports, frozen assets, no spare parts,
                        Allied cooperation, refusal to bend to demands.</p>
                    <p>d. The press has widely reported (front-page New York <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> yesterday) that we will cut off all trade with Iran within a
                        few days.<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">See Bernard Gwertzman, “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Plans Embargo on Iran on its Own as
                            Allies Shun Idea,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, January 18,
                            1980, p. A1.</note> This would be an appropriate time to make the
                        announcement so that we follow through on your promise to continue to turn
                        the economic screws on Iran while our hostages are there.</p>
                    <p>5. The centerpiece of your new Southwest Asia policy is aid to Pakistan—yet
                        the $400 million is already being discounted and disparaged by Pakistan.
                        Perhaps we could mention a consortium of western aid which you have
                        organized and pledges from our Allies could be obtained within the next few
                        days to bolster the package. Also, I see no reason for delay in converting
                        the Executive agreement into a treaty. It now appears we are unwilling to
                        give Pakistan the full protection she feels necessary (see front-page <hi rend="italic">Washington Star</hi> today).<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4">The article in the <hi rend="italic">Washington Star</hi> was not
                            found, but there was a front page <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>
                            article on the subject that day. See John M. Goshko, “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Forging Ahead on Aid to Pakistan,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, January 19, 1980, p.
                        A9.</note></p>
                    <p>6. Your dramatic decisions to bolster defense spending need to be better
                        emphasized. Having done it you should clearly explain the need and let
                        people know the boldness of your response.</p>
                    <p>7. The portions on Russia (pages 8–9 of Draft B–5, 1/17/80) seem misguided.
                        It appears that we are saying we are no threat to their interests and that
                        they face a choice they have already made. We should try to steer them back
                        to a cooperative position, but not indicate they have yet to make their
                        choice. The whole point of the Afghanistan invasion is that it is a clear
                        departure from their policies and that they have opted for the wrong
                        path.</p>
                    <p>8. I am simultaneously sending to you under separate memo my suggested
                        language for the economic/energy portion of the speech. I am also sending

                    <p>A status report prepared in the Central Intelligence Agency, January 21,
                        1980, described weapons shipments destined for Afghanistan as part of the
                        early stage of the covert action. The report noted that an unidentified
                        insurgent group had already received 50 AK–47s and 50,000 rounds of
                        ammunition. This information was elaborated on in an attached memorandum,
                        January 6, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] of the Central
                        Intelligence Agency to Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Stansfield Turner</persName>, in response to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>’s request for figures on
                        arms deliveries to Pakistan. The report itemized several shipments. One
                        shipment, delivered from [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to
                        Saudi Arabia and from there to Islamabad, contained 56,000 pounds of
                        matériel, including 50 RPG–7 rocket launchers, 35 12.7mm HMGs, 500 AK–47s,
                        640,000 rounds of AK–47 ammunition, and approximately 2,000 pounds of
                        explosives. Another shipment, delivered from Cairo to Dhahran, contained
                        another 56,000 pounds of matériel, including 1,000 rounds of RPG–7
                        ammunition and 210,000 rounds of 12.7mm HMG ammunition. Regarding the first
                        shipment, the memorandum reported that the equipment arrived in Islamabad
                        January 4, and was received by the Pakistani Intelligence Service. The
                        second shipment, the memorandum noted, contained Egyptian arms at a cost of
                        $1 million to the United States; an additional 32,000 pounds of arms were en
                        route from Dhahran to Cairo, delivered via [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>] at Saudi request, so as to conceal Saudi and Egyptian
                        involvement in the arms shipments. (Central Intelligence Agency, Office of
                        the Director of Central Intelligence, Job 82M00501R: 1980 Subject Files, Box
                        12, C–367, 01 Jan–30 Jun 80)</p>
                    <p>The status report also noted that another load of weapons was in the process
                        of being purchased from Egypt with Saudi money. An attached cable, prepared
                        in the Central Intelligence Agency January 18, transmitted authorization
                        from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Headquarters to the [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to place the following order:
                        15,000 rounds of 14.5mm HMG ammunition, 250 anti-tank grenades, 1,700
                        Czech-made anti-tank mines, 4,000 hand grenades, 50 82mm mortars with 2,500
                        rounds of prepared, and 100 RPG–7 launchers with 500 rockets. The cable
                        noted that the shipment should commence as soon as possible, with pickup in
                        Cairo en route to Islamabad. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                        Regarding the Soviet detection of the source of the weapons, Headquarters
                        advised that its depots contained weapons from several countries, but the
                        operation should ensure that only identifiably Egyptian arms should appear
                        in Afghanistan. (Central Intelligence Agency, <gloss target="#t_NIC_1">NIC</gloss> Files, Job 82M00501R, Box 12, C–367, 01 Jan–30 Jun 80)</p>
                    <p>Finally, the status report noted that Egypt was willing to sell 15 SA–7s, and
                        referred to an attached cable that authorized Pakistani <pb n="502" facs="0547" xml:id="pg_502"/>acquisition of the SA–7s. That cable was
                        not attached and not found, but a status report for <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s trip to Pakistan, January 29,
                        noted: “Regarding SA–7s, the Pakistanis would like American instructors to
                        train six to eight Pakistani Pushtu and Dari speaking Paks in SA–7
                        operations in a secure <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> military area.
                        They would later infiltrate into Afghanistan to work with the insurgents,
                        employ the weapons, and further train Afghans in the SA–7.” The report
                        further noted of the arms shipments: “We have some unilateral indications
                        that the weapons are being distributed by the Pakistanis to various
                        insurgent groups. The chief of Pakistan service is confident that under
                        present conditions, these weapons can be infiltrated overland into most
                        areas of Afghanistan, including the Hazarazat. The Pakistanis claim that the
                        availability of these weapons and promise of distribution was instrumental
                        in forcing the insurgents to establish at least a surface unity, which was
                        announced at the recently concluded Islamic Conference.” (Carter Library,

                        thoughts to throw into the hopper. One is that, if the Soviets and <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> continue to disregard the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions (as is likely),<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">See <ref target="#d136">Document 136</ref>.</note> the
                        Department try to persuade UNHQ to withdraw its aid missions from
                        Afghanistan. The other is that, were the Soviets ever to appear to realize
                        their presence in Afghanistan is too costly for them, the Department should
                        consider approaching <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> or
                        Indian <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>

                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. We at Embassy Kabul have been delighted with the strong response of
                        Washington to the Soviet occupation of this country. We applaud the steps
                        Washington has so far taken and share the widespread view that the Soviets
                        underestimated the degree of Western and world reaction. Suspecting that the
                            <gloss target="#t_Dept_1">Dept</gloss> is considering what additional
                        steps might be taken, I offer here two suggestions.</p>
                    <p>4. As we reported last week, the puppet Babrak regime has refrained from
                        telling its people about the Security Council and <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> votes.<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">This information was
                            reported in telegram 291 from Kabul, January 17. (National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D800028–0983)</note> Instead, it has tried to obfuscate the issue by
                        saturating the media with allegations of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and “imperialist” treacherousness and our alleged close
                        ties with “monster” <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName>.
                        While supressing what happened in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>,
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> has nonetheless not attacked the
                        institution of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> itself, and so far as
                        we can tell still holds it in respect. This is important in the context of
                        my recommendations.</p>
                    <p>5. First recommendation. As of this time, we are unaware of any UNHQ emissary
                        coming to Kabul to investigate whether the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> and the Soviets are complying with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions. But whether any emissaries come
                        or not, the Western Embassies here are unanimous in believing that the
                        Soviets are not about to pull out their forces. (Were they to do so, the
                        Babrak govt would instantaneously collapse.) On the contrary, there are many
                        signs that the Soviets are digging in to stay for a long time. Their forces
                        are building military bastions about Kabul, and their logistic arrangements
                        point to their establishing or taking over permanent lodging quarters.</p>
                    <p>6. Assuming that the Soviets have no intention of complying with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions, it seems to me that the least
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> itself can do is to withdraw its
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> economic aid missions here. Were this
                        done, this would be a severe psychological and discrediting blow to the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>—an action much more effective than
                        all the measures the Western Embassies here in aggregate could do. A
                        withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss> and <pb n="504" facs="0549" xml:id="pg_504"/>associated economic missions would confirm
                        in the eyes of the Afghan public, in a most telling way, the lack of
                        legitimacy of the Babrak regime. It would be a humiliating blow to the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. I hope, therefore, that the
                        Department will give serious weight to this recommendation—and if possible,
                        get it implemented by, say, the end of Feb.</p>
                    <p>7. Were though the Department to press such a recommendation on UNHQ, it
                        should be aware that there are <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> elements
                        here who would resist it. One, of course, would be the Bulgarian <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> res rep, Yuli Bahnev, who will use every
                        argument Moscow and Sofia can supply him to oppose it. At the very least he
                        will urge that a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> office be maintained
                        with the flag boldly flying, so as to maintain an unmistakeable presence and
                        to honor past contractual aid commitments. I think both arguments should be
                        resisted. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> office should be made to
                        close and the total <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence withdrawn.
                        Nothing less than hauling down the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> flag
                        is required to have the kind of political impact this govt and the Soviets
                        deserve. As for other local <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sources of
                        opposition, some among the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> experts would
                        be fearful for their jobs, and for self-serving reasons would oppose the
                        cancellation of their contracts.</p>
                    <p>8. My second recommendation, as mentioned in the summary, there may come a
                        time when the Soviets appreciate that their involvement here is too costly
                        and they may welcome a face-saving way to exit. If this were to occur—and it
                        would likely only happen if the insurgents can carry on an effective fight
                        against the Soviets and the Babrak government—then the Soviets might be
                        amenable to some face-saving suggestions. One that occurs to me is for
                        either <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> SecGen <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> or the Indian Government to propose the posting of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops in Afghanistan to replace the
                        Soviets. But were this done, care would have to be taken to make sure the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> troops were not here merely to
                        sustain the despised Babrak government. Hopefully, a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence would be conditional on its monitoring a relatively
                        free election to choose a new, legitimate government.</p>
                    <p>9. During a discussion this week with Indian Ambassador Jaskaran Teja (who
                        last served as <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> in Moscow and is
                        suspected among Western diplomats as being pro-Soviet and a Communist
                        sympathizer), Teja said he was sure the Soviets would never accept the idea
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> replacing its troops here. He
                        could be right. Certainly, the success of the Soviets at the end of WW II in
                        Eastern Europe gives them some reason to think they can get away with it
                        again, but I still think my suggestion worth bearing in mind.</p>
                    <p>10. Comment: I hope these two basic ideas are helpful.</p>

                        informal conversation during which he said that he felt that the Soviet
                        intervention in Afghanistan was unwise and not in the best interests of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>2. In early January 1980, officials of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs
                        who, in late December 1979 and early January 1980, were involved in the
                        support of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan said that the Soviet
                        decision to intervene was based on the following factors:</p>
                    <p>A. The Soviets were humiliated by the outcome of the August 1979 issue of
                        Soviet combat troops in Cuba. They considered that they had backed down on
                        this issue in deference to the right of the United States to dominate events
                        on its borders. The Soviets also accepted an unfavorable resolution of this
                        issue because, at the time, they still had hopes for a treaty from the
                        second session of the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II).</p>
                    <p>B. Soviet leaders saw the decision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
                            (<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>) to modernize its Theater
                        Nuclear Forces (<gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>) as an act requiring a
                        response.</p>
                    <p>C. The Soviet Embassy in Washington was reporting in November 1979 that there
                        was no chance of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Senate ratifying
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty.</p>
                    <p>D. Soviet personnel in Afghanistan had been tortured to death by Afghan
                        dissidents and retribution for these acts had become an emotional issue with
                        Soviet leaders.</p>
                    <p><pb n="506" facs="0551" xml:id="pg_506"/>E. The intervention of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the Dominican Republic in 1965 was
                        considered a valid precedent for Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The
                        Soviet view was, “who today remembers the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intervention in the Dominican Republic?”<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">For documentation on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intervention in the Dominican Republic in April 1965,

                    <p>3. The most important of these factors, according to the Soviet Foreign
                        Ministry officials, was that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had
                        imposed its will on Cuba in 1979 and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must demonstrate that its will must be respected in areas
                        close to its borders, as well.</p>
                    <p>4. The Foreign Ministry officials also said that the possibility of a boycott
                        against the Moscow Olympics had been considered during the planning for the
                        intervention in Afghanistan and that, in fact, it had been planned that
                        Soviet troops would be out of Afghanistan by 1 May 1980 to avoid disrupting
                        the games. The Ministry officials said that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> call for a boycott of the Olympics was a sore spot with
                        the Soviets and that Moscow would take a boycott seriously. Valentin Falin,
                        First Deputy Chief of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> Central
                        Committee’s International Information Department and former Soviet
                        Ambassador to West Germany, was quoted as saying that now, because of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ultimatum, it would be difficult
                        for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to withdraw its troops before
                        the Olympics.</p>
                    <p>5. According to Falin, Soviet leaders were completely surprised by the coup
                        which overthrew the Government of Afghan President Mohammad Daoud in 1978.
                        At that time, and again in January 1978, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Nur
                            Mohmmad Taraki</persName>, Daoud’s successor, asked for Soviet support,
                        but was refused. The Soviets did not trust Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> and repeatedly warned
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> to beware of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. According to Falin, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s attendance at the non-aligned
                        summit in Havana in September 1979 was a mistake as it gave <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> the opportunity to plan his coup.
                        Following that coup, the Soviets warned <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> not to kill <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. The Soviets held <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> responsible when, after three weeks in prison,
                            <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> was strangled. In
                        November 1979, the internal situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated to the
                        point where <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> asked for Soviet
                        intervention despite that fact that he realized the Soviets were not his
                        friends. In sum, as Falin explained it, the surprise overthrow of Daoud by a
                        leftist regime had started a chain of events which the Soviets reacted to
                        rather than initiated. The Soviets were prepared to accept the Daoud regime
                        and did not try to replace it, but when a pro-Soviet regime came to power,
                        they could not ignore it nor refuse to support it.</p>

                    <p>Four weeks after launching its invasion, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has encountered a range of political and military problems
                        in Afghanistan that portend an even deeper and larger Soviet role.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] Soviet officials
                        in Kabul indicate Moscow is dismayed over the failure of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>’s government thus far to take
                        hold. Babrak has made an effort, at Soviet behest, to try to appear more
                        moderate than his predecessors, but he is so obviously a Soviet puppet that
                        his regime would collapse if Soviet troops were to withdraw. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] <hi rend="italic">Soviet officials have complained about the factional and personal

                    <p>The disintegration of the Afghan military has speeded up since the Soviet
                        invasion. Rather than welcoming Soviet support against the insurgents, some
                        units have clashed with Soviet troops and the rate of desertions has
                        increased. The Soviets do not appear to have an effective remedy at
                        hand.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_SMS_1">Sokolov</persName>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s First Deputy Minister of
                            Defense and chief commander in Afghanistan, reacted to ineffectiveness
                            in one Afghan unit by recommending that its Soviet advisers be replaced.
                            But Afghan military dissatisfaction will increase as Soviet
                            advisers—under pressure from their superiors to produce results—take an
                            increasingly heavy hand in Afghan military affairs.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Insurgency</p>
                    <p>The introduction of Soviet troops—far from intimidating the insurgents—has
                        probably served to increase popular support for the rebellion. <hi rend="italic">The insurgents have taken advantage of the demoralization
                            of the Afghan Army and bad weather to maintain a steady harassment of
                            isolated Afghan towns and Soviet lines of communication. In particular,
                            the Soviets have had problems keeping open the Termez-Kabul road, which
                            passes through extremely difficult terrain.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><pb n="508" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_508"/>This has led the
                            Soviets to undertake a number of small-scale sweeps and to launch
                            tactical airstrikes and helicopter attacks at suspected rebel
                            concentrations. In the northeastern provinces of Takhar and Badakhshan,
                            the Soviets have undertaken a more ambitious operation to ensure that
                            the besieged provincial capitals do not fall to the rebels. This drive,
                            however, has been hampered by bad weather, poor road conditions, and
                            insurgent harassment.</hi><note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">A situation
                            report on Afghanistan, January 25, prepared in the Bureau of
                            Intelligence and Research, noted that Afghan and Soviet military forces
                            faced a “serious dilemma” regarding the insurgency: “They must carry out
                            orders that state ‘the rebels must be destroyed using all resources’
                            and, at the same time, adhere to a government policy of refraining from
                            attacking villages or pursuing rebels who take sanctuary in villages and
                            homes. That policy is part of a propaganda program to reduce hostility
                            toward the Soviet and Afghan armies.” (Central Intelligence Agency,

                        forces have been able to engage the rebels on terms that would allow the
                        Soviets to bring to bear their superior firepower and air support.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">We have had several reliable but fragmentary reports of
                            Soviet casualties. One report from a Soviet town near the border reports
                            the recent arrival of a large number of coffins bearing remains of
                            Soviets killed in Afghanistan. We believe the Soviets have sustained as
                            many as 2,000 killed and wounded since the invasion began. We have no
                            information about the number of insurgent casualties.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                    <p>Moscow probably will not find early relief from these problems. The Babrak
                        regime shows no sign of pulling together, and the situation in the Afghan
                        military will be extremely difficult to retrieve. Even under the best of
                        conditions, it could take years to assemble an Afghan military force capable
                        of controlling the country. Thus Moscow almost inevitably will have to take
                        a more direct hand in running and pacifying the country.</p>
                    <p>An early collapse of the rebellion also seems unlikely. Better weather in the
                        spring probably will bring an increase in insurgent activity.</p>
                    <p>All of this does not mean that Moscow cannot maintain essential control or
                        keep whatever government it wants in power in Kabul. Nor is there the
                        slightest sign that the Soviets might seriously contemplate withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>Politically, Moscow probably will intensify its effort to establish a more
                        effective Afghan Government. If Babrak cannot do the job, the Soviets could
                        engineer yet another coup in Kabul, as embarrassing as that might be for
                        them. But they are unlikely to come up with a formula <pb n="509" facs="0554" xml:id="pg_509"/>that resolves the contradiction between
                        their interest in a government with broader support and their intention of
                        dominating Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Militarily, the Soviets could continue on their present course, under which
                        their military forces maintain control of Kabul and other essential points
                        and conduct counterinsurgency operations necessary to prevent major
                        setbacks. But this seems unlikely since it would allow the insurgents a free
                        hand in most of the country, allow them to prey on extended Soviet supply
                        lines, and present the Soviet leadership with the prospect of continued
                        casualties and a steady drain on resources.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets now have the forces in Afghanistan to conduct a somewhat expanded
                        counterinsurgency effort. It is unlikely, however, that the forces now there
                        could end the insurgency. If the Soviets seek to end the insurgency—and, as
                        seems likely, cannot rely on effective support from the Afghan Army—they
                        will have to commit more forces.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, this is not happening. There has been a stream of
                        Government-originated analysis and public testimony which has muddied the
                        waters with regard to (a) the motivations that impelled the Soviets to
                        attack Afghanistan, (b) the prospects which the Soviets face in Afghanistan,
                        and (c) the length of time that we are prepared to maintain the current
                        series of punitive actions <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> the Soviets. The
                        line propounded has directly undercut the President’s message. Whether this
                        is intentional or unintentional, I do not know. But what is clear to me is
                        that our interests are being damaged in the process. The harmful line which
                        has emerged, and which has been consciously abetted by the Soviets, is as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Why Did the Soviets Attack</hi>? According to one school of
                        thought, the Soviets felt impelled to move into Afghanistan because of
                        legitimate defensive concerns to avert chaos in a neighboring Communist
                        state and because the penalties which such a move would normally trigger in
                        terms of US-Soviet relations and world opinion were no longer operative.
                        Moscow was thus, allegedly influenced by the overall downturn in US-Soviet
                        relations, as exemplified by the Cuban brigade crisis, the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> dispute, friction over Southeast Asian
                        relief and security matters, US defense increases, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II delay, etc. The obvious assumption behind this argument
                        is that the Soviet invasion only has implications for Afghanistan itself, is
                        not connected with the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf and Iranian
                        oil, and that making a US-Soviet or East-West issue out of it is a big
                        mistake. The further implication is that if <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> had passed and we had not decided on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> deployment, the Soviets would not have
                        invaded Afghanistan. Almost all genuine experts on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would argue that this last assertion is
                        highly implausible; that the Czechoslovakia decision in 1968 was a hard one
                        for <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>, but that given his
                        outlook and that of his colleagues, the decision to invade Afghanistan
                        caused little if any internal dissent among the leadership; and that the
                        Soviets would have gone into Afghanistan no matter what the state of
                        US-Soviet relations had been in December 1979. (In fact, it might be useful
                        for <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> partisans to ponder the
                        fact that had <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> passed on schedule in
                        November, and <pb n="511" facs="0556" xml:id="pg_511"/>had the Soviets
                        followed-up with an invasion of Afghanistan in December, the President’s
                        chances for reelection at this point would be considerably slimmer than they
                        are at present.) (S)</p>
                    <p>In any case, excusing the Soviet invasion or laying the blame for it on the
                        feebleness of our diplomacy and the lack of wisdom of specific actions taken

                            the United States, which listed a number of issues not directly related
                            to Afghanistan that compelled the Soviet intervention. These included

                        Administration. We are not, after all, participating in a graduate seminar.
                        If we lay emphasis on US culpability for the worsening of US-Soviet
                        relations and indicate that this is the prime factor, or at least a prime
                        factor, in the Soviet decision to invade Afghanistan, this takes the Soviets
                        off the hook both in the United States and abroad, undercuts the President’s
                        position both with the US public and with the Allies, and measurably weakens
                        our chances for getting a satisfactory reaction on the part of others to
                        Soviet aggression. (S)</p>
                    <p>The line which should be adopted by all authoritative US officials is the one
                        very clearly enunciated by the President, i.e., that this is an
                        unprecedented event, marks a very grave deterioration of the peace, has
                        extremely ominous ramifications for the future, requires concerted
                        international effort to deal with it, demonstrates the callous insensitivity
                        of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to the ordinary norms of
                        international behavior, and is, in short, the gravest threat to the general
                        peace since the Second World War. In other words, this is no time to be
                        “even-handed” in backgrounding Soviet motivations, nor should we downplay
                        the obvious geopolitical factors which influenced the Soviets to take over
                        Afghanistan in the first place. (C)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">A Soviet Miscalculation?</hi> Other recent background
                        briefings from “high Government officials” have stressed the
                        “miscalculation” that the Soviets have made by moving into Afghanistan.<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">Not further identified and not found.</note>
                        According to this line of reasoning, the Soviets are now becoming involved
                        “in another Vietnam” and will not be successful in suppressing the
                        insurgency through military means for years to come. My view, on the
                        contrary, is that the Soviet war aims—to control the population centers, the
                        lines of communication and the major passes leading to Pakistan—will <pb n="512" facs="0557" xml:id="pg_512"/>almost certainly be accomplished by
                        this summer, and that Soviet control of the media will then make it possible
                        for them, without necessarily eliminating the resistance everywhere in
                        Afghanistan, simply to declare victory, a declaration which will be greeted
                        with a sigh of relief by our European Allies, among others (Tab C).<note n="6" xml:id="d180fn6">Printed as <ref target="#d132">Document
                            132</ref>.</note> (C)</p>
                    <p>Whether this is a correct analysis or not really begs the question. The
                        hidden assumption behind the statement that Afghanistan is a “Soviet
                        Vietnam” is that the Soviets are having, and will have, so much trouble in
                        that country that this in itself will be a lesson to them to desist from
                        further actions of this kind. The corresponding message for Americans is
                        that the Soviets will derive the same lessons from Afghanistan that we did
                        from Vietnam. This is not only contrary to fact but also undermines our
                        policy, because it implies that it would be sufficient for the United States
                        and our Allies simply to sit back and observe Soviet discomfiture at the
                        “miscalculation.” Strong actions on our part, in this light, are obviously
                        overreactions. Such analysis consequently undercuts our efforts to ensure
                        that our Allies take, and the general public supports, strong, concrete and
                        punitive measures against the Soviets because of Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Short Duration of Our Reaction</hi>. Some public
                        testimony, in addition to much background briefing, leaves the implication
                        that the pendulum will swing back in due course and that within several
                        months we can expect “business as usual” with the Soviets. This has been
                        evident at several meetings I have recently attended. The primary evidence
                        for such belief is that we have carefully maintained the fabric of our
                        relationship and have not “broken any agreements” with the Soviets. In fact,
                        the Soviets are carefully spreading the myth that they will be withdrawing
                        from Afghanistan in short order. The Singaporeans evidently believe such
                        twaddle and have warned us not to be left holding the bag when this fabled
                        event takes place in thirty days. (The Soviets, of course, spread the same
                        sort of stories and repeated them officially after the invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia.) (S)</p>
                    <p>Questioning the long-term commitment of the President to the actions we have
                        undertaken undercuts his leadership, puts his judgment in doubt, and is
                        politically very damaging (i.e., if this is the most serious event since the
                        Second World War, then why will we be engaging in “business as usual” in a
                        matter of months?). Furthermore, it is grist for the mill of those Europeans
                        and others who argue against taking precipitate or strong action against the
                        Soviets. (S)</p>

                        speaking with one voice in disseminating the following analysis of events in
                        Afghanistan:</p>
                    <quote><p>—The Soviet decision to invade Afghanistan was a carefully considered
                            one and grew out of the mission of General Pavlovski to Afghanistan,
                            which began last August.</p>
                        <p>—The Czars thirsted after ports on the Indian Ocean for centuries. In
                            line with those historical aspirations, Molotov asked von Ribbentrop for
                            a sphere of influence over Afghanistan and Iran in 1940. The Soviets
                            marched into Northern Iran in 1942 and again in 1946. The geopolitical
                            aims of the Soviets in taking over Afghanistan should not be
                            underestimated. Soviet education, doctrine, and outlook would all lead
                            one to believe that the geopolitical factor is an important element in
                            the Soviet design to turn Afghanistan from a buffer state into the
                            Mongolia of Southwest Asia.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets are, of course, aware that by introducing their troops into
                            Afghanistan they are measurably escalating the risks of eventual armed
                            conflict. Obviously, they felt the risk was worth taking.</p>
                        <p>—The elimination of Afghanistan as a buffer state in Southwest Asia, just
                            as the elimination of Cambodia as a buffer state in Southeast Asia,
                            indicates a dangerous, even unprecedented, new adventurism on the part
                            of the Soviets, who have been, ever since 1975, demonstrating a growing
                            willingness to use armed force to settle disputes in their favor in
                            Third World countries.</p>
                        <p>—Our best forecast is that the Soviets will put enough strength into
                            Afghanistan to prevail militarily and that they will eventually subdue
                            Afghanistan, just as they subdued the peoples of the Baltic and East
                            Europe in the 1940s. Any other conclusion would be wishful thinking.</p>
                        <p>—While we would welcome being proved wrong, we do not expect the Soviets
                            to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.
                            Our reaction to the Soviet aggression must, therefore, be firm, measured
                            and long-term in nature.</p>
                        <p>—The United States has no intention of resuming a “business as usual”
                            posture toward the Soviet Union until we are convinced that the Kremlin
                            has absorbed the message that was delivered in the State of the Union

                        Policy.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. One of the first authoritative Soviet reactions to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s State of the Union message has
                        come from Leonid Zamyatin, Chief of the International Information Department
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> Central Committee, who
                        appeared, along with Yevgeny Primakov, the Director of the Institute of
                        Oriental Studies of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Academy of
                        Sciences, on the January 26 “Studio 9” television program.</p>
                    <p>3. Zamyatin made the sharpest criticism to date of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> personally and of the “turnaround”
                        in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy—which he said had begun long
                        before Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">An item in the President’s
                            Daily Brief, January 29, described an article in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, January 29, as “Moscow’s initial authoritative reply”
                            to <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s State of the Union
                            address, and characterized it as “polemical and vindictive” and “replete
                            with abusive language about your administration.” (Central Intelligence
                            Agency, Office of the Director of Central Intelligence, Job 81B00401R:

                            Crisis—December 1979, PDBs)</note> He also, for the first time to our
                        knowledge by a high level Soviet official, publicly made the charge that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> was a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> agent. The Soviet press has printed this
                        charge before, but attributed it to Afghan officials. Also of interest are
                        Zamyatin’s claim that the Soviet Union more than once had warned the United
                        States via diplomatic channels to “stop the action against <pb n="515" facs="0560" xml:id="pg_515"/>Afghanistan that you are carrying out from
                        the territory of Pakistan” and Primakov’s charge that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is planning military intervention in Iran.
                        In this latter connection, Primakov said Soviet declarations had made it
                        clear that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could not stand aside
                        if events took such a turn.</p>
                    <p>4. Zamyatin was, in effect, elaborating <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s claim in his January 12 <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> interview that, if there had not been an Afghanistan, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would have had to invent one in
                        order to further its policy of destroying détente.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">See <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note> But
                        Zamyatin did so with all the venom and invective for which he is famous. His
                        analysis was that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is embarking on
                        the role of world gendarme, and he illustrated the point by quoting James
                        Reston as having told him on his recent visit to Moscow that Washington was
                        “nostalgic” for the days of <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>
                        when the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could carry its will anywhere
                        in the world.</p>
                    <p>5. Zamyatin also elaborated <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s “threat from the south” theme, providing considerable
                        detail aimed at convincing his audience that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was on the verge of taking over Afghanistan and that,
                        between that and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s machinations
                        with the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, the Soviet Union really had
                        no choice but to act. Given the shrillness of his remarks on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy, the Soviet listener must have been
                        a bit puzzled by both Zamyatin’s and Primakov’s concluding references to the
                        viability of the policy of détente and to <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> determination to continue in this direction because there
                        is no alternative to détente.</p>
                    <p>6. Our conclusion, based on programs such as this, as well as <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks in Damascus<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4"><persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                            remarks on Afghanistan during his visit to Damascus were reported in
                            telegram 662 from Damascus, January 28. The telegram characterized
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> as “strongly
                            attacking” the United States during an exchange of toasts at a dinner in
                            his honor, January 27. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D800049–0340)</note>
                        and reports we have received of bilateral Soviet approaches to the French
                        and West Germans, that the Soviets are taken aback by the strength of the
                        international reaction to their invasion of Afghanistan and are now rapidly
                        mounting an all-out propaganda offensive in an effort to shift world
                        opprobrium to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> While many of their
                        “big lie” charges are ludicrous, we fear that continued denials, such as

                    <p>1. During a series of meetings at GHQ from 21 to 26 January 1980, President
                        Mohammad <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia ul-Haq</persName> and a group of
                        senior Pakistani military officers discussed how the Pakistani military
                        should respond if Soviet and Afghan forces cross into Pakistan in “hot
                        pursuit” of Afghan insurgent forces.</p>
                    <p>2. Martial Law Administration Chief of Staff and General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s personal staff officer, Major General
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM_1">K.M. Arif</persName>, led off the
                        discussion by suggesting that a meeting should be arranged between President
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and the Soviet Ambassador in
                        Islamabad to assure the Soviets that Pakistan will not aid the Afghan
                        insurgents. If this assurance is not made, the question of “hot pursuit”
                        will soon arise and the Soviet and Afghan forces will assuredly pursue the
                        insurgent forces into Pakistan. In such a situation, Pakistan will be the
                        “loser”, according to General <persName corresp="#p_AKM_1">Arif</persName>.</p>
                    <p>3. Lt. General Mohammad Iqbal Khan basically agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_AKM_1">Arif</persName>’s assessment, adding that only if
                        Pakistan receives adequate military aid and assistance from outside sources
                        should the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> military respond strongly to
                        an incursion into <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> territory.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">An intelligence information cable prepared in the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, January 29, reported
                            information [<hi rend="italic">text and 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            regarding a special report on Pakistan’s defense needs, prepared for
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> by the Pakistani
                            Ambassador in Moscow. The report concluded that Pakistan would be unable
                            to “meet a sustained military attack from the Soviets in the present
                            state of readiness.” This shortcoming, according to the report, could
                            only be reversed by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid, and the
                            “best possible” way to assure <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            commitment to Pakistani security would be the establishment of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military bases in Pakistan.

                            Pakistan)</note> In the absence of strong support from the outside as

                        Soviet or Afghan incursion, and that any future skirmishes along the border
                        should be limited to insurgents and Afghan or Soviet forces. (Field comment:
                        This recent position taken by General Iqbal is somewhat different from a
                        more hawkish position he held in early January as reported in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] from the same

                        did not venture an opinion on the question of hot pursuit. He did report,
                        however, that the tribal chiefs in the tribal territories adjacent to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NWFP_1">NWFP</gloss> had given him assurances that the
                        army would have complete freedom of movement in the tribal areas. General
                        Fazle Haq also reported that as of 26 January there had been no
                        confrontations between <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> and Soviet
                        forces along the border.</p>

                        Soviet/Afghan military attacks into Pakistan had been developed, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had instructed senior
                        commanders that if the Soviet or Afghan forces cross into Pakistan in a hot

                        that Pakistan must hit hard at the first incursion even if Soviets use

                        groups including the four most important ones—was formed only after
                        considerable prodding by the Pakistanis. At the Islamic Conference yesterday
                        it was allowed to discuss the insurgents’ position and to appeal for
                        financial support.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">The Conference of Islamic

                            for an emergency session, January 27–29, to discuss the Soviet
                            intervention in Afghanistan. A news report on the meeting quoted General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>: “An unequivocal message
                            should go forth from this conference conveying to the Soviet Union the
                            grave concern of the Islamic world at the presence of its troops in
                            Afghanistan and calling upon that great power to reverse the course of
                            its military intervention.” (William Mullen, “Soviets Warned of Breaking
                            Ties with Moslem Nations,” <hi rend="italic">Chicago Tribune</hi>,
                            January 28, 1980, p. 14) In telegram 1501 from Moscow, January 29, the
                            Embassy reported on the Islamic Conference from the Soviet perspective.
                            In the aftermath of the strong anti-Soviet sentiment of the conference,
                            the Embassy observed that the Soviet leadership “apparently made a
                            serious miscalculation of the Islamic reaction to the invasion of
                            Afghanistan,” and that the conference “represents a serious setback to
                            Soviet foreign policy interests in the Muslim world.” (Carter Library,
                            National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Cables File, Box 6,
                            Afghanistan: 1/29/80)</note> The resolution adopted early today calling
                        on Islamic states to withhold recognition of Afghanistan until Soviet troops
                        withdraw declares that a three-nation committee will supervise aid for the

                    <p>Pakistani pressure may help to check infighting within the new organization.
                        The exiles are reportedly on notice that further aid—including antitank and
                        antiaircraft weapons—from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other sympathetic
                        countries is contingent upon the survival of a unified exile organization.

                    <p>With the exception of one or two groups that have a small guerrilla
                        capability, the exile organizations do not command forces that have been
                        active in the Afghan insurgency. The exiles have provided the various
                        independent insurgent groups with modest amounts of arms and supplies and
                        could become a more effective conduit if Pakistan should take charge of
                        logistical arrangements. Disclosure of more direct Pakistani support of the
                        Afghan insurgency, however, is certain to elicit a sharp reaction from
                        Moscow. [<hi rend="italic">1 line, classification marking, and handling

                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> last night. Pam and Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> were present at dinner
                        but not afterwards.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated the Soviets would
                        be ready to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan providing we stopped
                        outside intervention, particularly from Pakistan. He did not mention China.
                        He concentrated on Pakistan as the source of greatest danger. He suggested
                        that if necessary the Soviet government would be willing to join in
                        guaranteeing Pakistan’s security and independence. He said also we should
                        not establish any military bases in the Persian Gulf but made no mention of
                        the Indian Ocean.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> drew a bracket along the left side of this
                            paragraph and an asterisk in the margin.</note></p>
                    <p>At a different time, he indicated the Soviet Union would strongly object to
                        any <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military assistance to China but
                        said they were not concerned by intervention by Iran.</p>
                    <p>He had indicated that they were developing a carefully trained communist
                        regime, but in answer to my question he said that he did not rule out the
                        possibility of a neutral government for Afghanistan. He had emphasized their
                        satisfaction with the government under the King, which of course Daoud
                        overthrew. He emphasized the cruelty of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and maintained specifically that not a single
                        individual had been executed since their troops intervened and most of the
                        political prisoners had been released from jail.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> was deeply concerned because
                        it appeared to him there was no channel of communication between our two
                        governments. This he considers dangerous.</p>
                    <p>May I suggest, as I indicated yesterday, that you write a letter to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> in which you emphasize the
                        importance of Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and that conditions
                        surrounding it might be discussed in an early meeting between Cy and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">Despite <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>’s suggestion, no letter from <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> was found. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> on February 8; see <ref target="#d202">Document

                        on a step-by-step basis.</p>
                    <p>In addition, it may be worthwhile your asking <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> to see our Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Tom Watson</persName>, and in turn indicating that after that you would
                        receive <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">No record of a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> or between <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> was found. <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> January 30; see <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note> I am satisfied that Tom
                        can be of enormous help at this time if he gets entrée to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> as well as <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In answer to my question on <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s health, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> told me that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had some good days and some bad ones.</p>
                    <p>Of most importance is getting the troops out of Afghanistan. The Soviet
                        threat in the area would then be vastly reduced. At an appropriate time Cy
                        might indicate to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> that if we
                        agree to have no bases in the Persian Gulf, the Soviets should agree that
                        there would be no communist regime in Iran.</p>
                    <p>In sum, a complete withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan by the
                        autumn, with the installation of a neutral government and an agreement by
                        the Soviets on Iran, would be a good way out of the crisis.</p>
                    <p>If ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II could be
                        obtained, it would be useful. I would hope progress could be made in the
                        negotiations in the arms control field, which I understand are continuing.
                        Progress on <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> and theatre nuclear
                        weapons would be important.</p>
                    <p>I will, of course, continue to be in touch with Cy.</p>

                            combat the Soviet “disinformation campaign” with a series of talking

                    <p>2. Summary: <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded to our
                        démarche on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations and
                        Afghanistan by elaborating the emerging public line that the administration
                        had embarked, long before Afghanistan, on a course aimed at damaging <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations and increasing
                        international tension. He ticked off numerous “examples” to illustrate his
                        point, beginning with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s adoption of
                        its Long-Term Defense Program while the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> Special Session on Disarmament was in session and
                        including familiar complaints about the <gloss target="#t_LRTNF_1">LRTNF</gloss> decision as violating the equality which the President
                        had allegedly acknowledged existed at the time of the Vienna Summit. He also
                        faulted our handling of the Cuban brigade issue and charged that our conduct
                        in the various arms control negotiations indicated that we were negotiating
                        simply for the sake of negotiating, not with any intention of reaching
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>On Afghanistan, though he did not refer specifically to threats to Soviet
                        security and only indirectly accused the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> of responsibility for events there, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> generally repeated the public
                        Soviet justifications for their action. He flatly denied a Soviet role in
                        the change of government in Kabul, and he just as flatly stated that the
                        Soviet troops would not be withdrawn so long as “external aggression”
                        continued. He tried to dismiss as “not serious” any suggestion that the
                        Soviet Union had designs on Pakistan or the Persian Gulf region, adding that
                            <pb n="523" facs="0568" xml:id="pg_523"/>anyone who really had doubts on
                        that score should know that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        had clearly denied it.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName> case, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said, was a domestic affair which
                        the Soviets were not prepared to discuss with any outsiders.</p>
                    <p>The Minister interspersed his basically hard-line response with appropriate
                        indications of indignation, ridicule, and regret, but for the most part he
                        seemed relaxed throughout the lengthy meeting. As was probably to be
                        expected, there was no indication in anything he said of any give on
                        Afghanistan in the near future. There was one conciliatory note at the end
                        of his presentation, when he picked up our reference to the President’s
                        willingness to search for areas of cooperation and reduce the risks of
                        conflict. If we were sincere, he said, we would find that the Soviets would
                        not hold back, as this had always been their policy.</p>

                        in providing guarantees with regard to Iran and Pakistan—unless his
                        observation that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had
                        already assured the world that they have no designs on other parts of the
                        region could be considered such. As for Soviet withdrawal, his assertion
                        that this would not occur until outside aggression ceased seems more
                        categorical than <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>’s hint that
                        limitations on assistance to insurgents might suffice. Yugoslavia did not
                        arise in the conversation. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> received me at 4:30 p.m.
                        January 30 for a two hour and fifteen minute meeting. I read to him the
                        talking points on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations and
                        Afghanistan from refs A and B and then also made the instructed démarche on
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sakharov</persName>, leaving copies of the
                        talking points on both subjects as non-papers.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>15. Calling it his 7th point, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        took up Afghanistan, noting that I had singled it out for “special
                        treatment” in my statement.<note n="4" xml:id="d186fn4">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> was referring to the démarche,
                            not to a separate statement, which was not found.</note> He observed
                        first of all that Afghanistan is not an American province. I might reply, he
                        said, that it is not a Soviet province either. This is true, and the Soviets
                        never claimed that it was. But the Soviets resolutely reject all efforts to
                        deny the Afghanis the right to decide for themselves questions of how they
                        are to live, what kind of leadership they are to have, and so forth—and the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is claiming the right to do
                        that.</p>
                    <p><pb n="524" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_524"/>16. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government can be in no doubt, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued, that Afghanistan was
                        subjected to outside aggression. It was in that connection that it called
                        for assistance. In accordance with the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Charter and the Soviet-Afghan treaty it had a firm legal basis and every
                        right to appeal for help, including that of a military character in the
                        struggle against external aggression. Washington, he said, does not like to
                        touch on that question; it pretends not to see how things really are, to be
                        aware of the aggression from the territory of Pakistan. Perhaps, he said, I
                        could advise Washington to pay more attention to that question so it could
                        see the situation better. He then referred to camps in Pakistan where
                        thousands of people were being armed and trained and being sent to struggle
                        against the people and Government of Afghanistan. In answering the
                        President’s message sent on the hot line, <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had stated that there was a great deal the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could do to stop those armed incursions
                        from Pakistan.<note n="5" xml:id="d186fn5">For <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s message to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>, December 28, see <ref target="#d113">Document

                        But this was not and is not being done.</p>
                    <p>17. The Soviet military contingents are in Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> continued, and there is no basis
                        for them to be withdrawn. They will remain there until such time as there is
                        no external aggression and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Government must realize that. The Soviets pointed out in their initial
                        statement to certain governments—without waiting for any propaganda
                        campaigns to develop—that their contingents would be withdrawn if the
                        external aggression ceased. The Soviet Union does not need Afghanistan—its
                        territory or its riches. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government
                        and the President are aware of that. And the deeds and the words of the
                        Soviets—unlike those of some others—do not diverge.</p>
                    <p>18. What <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> numbered example no.
                        8 was that Washington continued to repeat one false thesis, which had also
                        been mentioned albeit softly in my earlier statement. This was that the
                        Soviet Union was somehow involved in the changes in the leadership of
                        Afghanistan. Nyet. That is an invention of Washington’s. The Soviet Union
                        was not involved. The change was brought about by the Afghanis themselves.
                        The present Afghan leaders did not come from the moon. The Afghanis formed
                        their government and it is general knowledge that it is not doing badly. For
                        example, tens of thousands of prisoners have been set free, including large
                        numbers of Muslim clergy. Washington likes to speak of human rights. It
                        should welcome this move, even if it does not applaud it. But it does not do
                        so because this does not interest the administration; it is only interested
                        in “pinching the foot” of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p><pb n="525" facs="0570" xml:id="pg_525"/>19. It would be better, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> went on, to stick closer to the
                        facts. Meanwhile, no one should tell the Afghanis how to run their affairs.
                        And it is now clear to the whole world what kind of figure <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> was. One can only be astonished at
                        what is being said about him in Washington. Every Afghani damns him, but
                        Washington seems to like him.</p>
                    <p>20. As example no. 9, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> took up
                        Pakistan and the Persian Gulf, stating in this connection that he found the
                        turn of Washington’s thinking on foreign policy questions really remarkable.
                        This was especially true in connection with the aggression against
                        Afghanistan, and also in regard to the statement in my démarche which
                        implied anxiety on the part of the administration that the Soviet Union
                        might take some action in regard to Pakistan and the Persian Gulf. In actual
                        fact, he said, he thought that Washington did not actually think that way;
                        there were too many leading figures who knew better, and only the paranoid
                        could believe that the Soviets were intending action against Pakistan and in
                        the region of the Persian Gulf. He asked that I inform my government and the
                        President accordingly. My statement, he said, suggested that the Soviets
                        were sending some sort of challenge. He asked what kind of challenge and to
                        whom. As for the alleged danger to Pakistan and the Persian Gulf region, it
                        was not enough to say simply that this was false; it was fabricated. The
                        thought could only arise in the mind of a person who does not go to the
                        trouble to analyze the situation. Anyone who knows the Soviet Union knows
                        that such action is alien to the Soviet Union’s policies, ideology, and
                        foreign policy line aimed at international détente and peace.</p>
                    <p>21. Noting that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had made it
                        clear, in his answers to a <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> correspondent, that
                        any such intentions toward Pakistan, Iran and the Persian Gulf were alien to
                        the Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                        he was thus spared the necessity of speaking in more detail on the
                            matter.<note n="6" xml:id="d186fn6">See <ref target="#d166">Document
                                166</ref>.</note> He could only wonder however at the people who
                        posed such questions concerning the intentions of the Soviet Union, and he
                        asked whether I personally, as an Ambassador, and as an important
                        representative of the American business community, could really believe such
                        fabrications. But if there should be someone, somewhere, who has such
                        beliefs, he hoped that his clarification would help them understand the
                        truth of the matter.</p>
                    <p>22. As his tenth example, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        referred by indirection to the measures taken by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in response to the Afghanistan action. The administration,
                        he said, is now working energetically in shirtsleeves to increase
                        international tension and sow discord in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations. <pb n="526" facs="0571" xml:id="pg_526"/><persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has clearly pointed
                        out that it is easy to destroy relations but much harder to build them up
                        and develop them. The question arises of how a great power can simply throw
                        aside all of the positive things which have been accumulated over the years
                        by previous administrations. He described the administration as looking
                        around, throwing things overboard rapidly, and if it finds any left throwing
                        them overboard as well. He then mentioned with some forcefulness that the
                        Soviet Union had not come into being due to some external force but through
                        the forces of its own people, in the same way as the United States came into
                        being and exists with all of its social and economic attributes without any
                        external approval. Questions of whether we approve of a social and economic
                        structure or not, it seemed to him, should be set aside in our relations.
                        Meanwhile, he concluded, it was not the Soviet Union but the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side which bears responsibility for the
                        growth of tension and for damage to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>—As for Afghanistan, I said I had heard what <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> had said but that I assumed he did not really mean
                        that he thought the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was involved in any
                        aggression against Afghanistan. Nor was I aware from any information which
                        had come to me that Pakistan citizens were involved in the conflict, though
                        he had referred to Pakistan involvement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> responded that I simply then did not have the
                        facts—that there was no doubt about Pakistani involvement. There was massive
                        evidence about their assistance in training Afghan rebels, about the supply
                        of arms, and about the fact that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms
                        were also involved.</p>
                    <p>—I told <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> I would like to
                        understand more clearly what he had said about Soviet involvement in the
                        events in Afghanistan, particularly with regard to the change of government.
                        Our information, I said, was that Babrak had arrived in Kabul on a Soviet
                        plane. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> retorted that we put
                        such information into circulation ourselves and then believed it when it
                        comes back to us. I said I didn’t think that was where my information had
                        come from and that I had in fact had the impression that Babrak had been
                        living in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>25. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> then returned to my
                        remarks on theater nuclear weapons to state that the principle of equality
                        does not relate just to strategic arms. When this principle was addressed in
                        Vienna it was understood that it related to the entire military and
                        strategic posture and equilibrium of the two sides.<note n="7" xml:id="d186fn7">During the summit in Vienna held June 15–18, 1979,

                            in two meetings on January 17. See <ref target="frus1977-80v06#d203"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. VI, Soviet

                        would be the absurd situation of reaching equality in one field <pb n="527" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_527"/>and having it destroyed in a second or
                        third field. Another aspect of the issue, he added, was that while <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> medium-range missiles could reach the
                        territory of the Soviet Union, just like strategic missiles, Soviet

                    <p>The following will be your objectives in your discussions with President

                        officials.</p>
                    <p>—Lay a solid basis for a further mutual understanding of the issues we face
                        as regards Soviet behavior and intentions, global and regional responses,
                        and our bilateral trust and cooperation. An important part of this exchange

                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. You should draw on my State of the Union
                        message.</p>
                    <p>—To impress upon <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> that our support
                        for Pakistan’s independence and security is enduring, based on our vital
                        interests, and backed up not only by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                        to mobilize broad international support.</p>
                    <p>—To reaffirm the present level of our proposed bilateral assistance through

                        from our central effort, to voice public disappointment with our assistance
                        or to criticize <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> unwillingness to

                    <p><pb n="528" facs="0573" xml:id="pg_528"/>—To begin to define with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and his advisers the nature of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> responses in various contingencies arising
                        from a Soviet-Afghan threat to Pakistan’s security.</p>
                    <p>—To present our firm view that it is essential to Pakistan’s security that
                        Pakistan and India continue to expand their efforts toward normalization of
                        their relations.</p>
                    <p>—To seek assurances that the <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        government will not test a nuclear device and to impress upon <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> how dangerous a test would be to
                        Pakistan’s security and to the new Western relationship we are seeking to
                        develop. And to point out that a satisfactory long-term relationship
                        requires a settlement of the nuclear problem.</p>
                    <p>—To convey to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest in a resolution of Pakistan’s
                        internal political and economic problems so that Pakistan can address its
                        security problems from a united base.</p>
                    <p>—To inform <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> of our intention to
                        proceed with: submission of the Pakistan legislation on February 4; military
                        supply talks in Islamabad following your meetings; discussions of the
                        programming of our proposed AID funds; and continuing <hi rend="italic">mutual</hi> efforts to muster broad support for Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>You should describe to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        why it is not feasible to convert the 1959 Bilateral Agreement into a
                        treaty. You should impress upon <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        the relevance of the 1959 Agreement for the contingencies of a Soviet or
                        Soviet-directed attack on Pakistan. You should also note my letter to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">See <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> and
                        point out that we are asking the Congress to affirm the 1959 bilateral. You
                        can assure him that in the event of an attack threatening the independence
                        of Pakistan, we would consider our vital interests to be engaged and we
                        would consult urgently with both the Government of Pakistan and the Congress
                        on steps to be taken, including the use of force. (S)</p>
                    <p>In discussing contingencies with Pakistan, you should raise (but not press at
                        this time) the possibility of additional <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> access to facilities or bases on Pakistani soil. However,
                        in addressing possible large-scale Soviet incursions or assaults on
                        Pakistan, you should note that it is in our mutual interest to begin
                        discussions of ways in which <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces,
                        particularly naval and <gloss target="#t_tacair_1">tacair</gloss>, could be
                        deployed in and near Pakistan in certain situations. You should also
                        indicate that we would be prepared now to make an exercise visit of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> tactical aircraft and/or engage in joint
                        air or naval exercises if Pakistan would find that a useful demonstration of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> resolve. (S)</p>
                    <p><pb n="529" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_529"/>In responding to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s questions on contingencies involving
                        an Indian attack on Pakistan, you should point out that Pakistan’s best
                        security against a two-front war or an Indian attack lies in the
                        normalization process with India, and the strength of its broad-range
                        relationships with China, the United States, the Moslem world and the
                        Non-Aligned. You should make clear that the interests of Pakistan, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the West would be injured by
                        closer Indian relations with the Soviets and we should all work to avoid
                        such a course on India’s part. (S)</p>
                    <p>In your discussions of military assistance for Pakistan, you should emphasize
                        that we are prepared to move quickly in providing equipment that can be made
                        readily available and will immediately improve the situation along the
                        Afghan border, strengthening the ground and air defense capability. While we
                        will be willing to assist the Pakistanis in seeking financing from others
                        for high-performance aircraft, these financing requirements should be
                        considered in the context of overall defense needs and the priority for the
                        immediate strengthening of defense on the border. (S)</p>
                    <p>You should inform President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> that
                        the amounts of our military and economic support assistance for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980 and 81 are firm. You may also say that
                        in considering our levels for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1982 and
                        beyond, we will carefully assess Pakistan’s ongoing requirements. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> should also be apprised that
                        we are making strong efforts, in support of their own activities, to enhance
                        support for Pakistan from other Western and Islamic donors. On debt
                        rescheduling, you can inform <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> that
                        we are prepared to consider this question in concert with other creditors in
                        conjunction with an upper tranche IMF stabilization program, if an emerging
                        default situation seems likely. (S)</p>
                    <p>In addressing the nuclear question, you should seek assurances (in addition
                        to the assurances on non-development of weapons and transfer of sensitive
                        technology) that President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> will
                        not test a nuclear device while he is in office. You should stress that we
                        will continue our dialogue with Pakistan looking forward to an understanding
                        on the scope and purpose of Pakistan’s nuclear program. (S)</p>
                    <p>If you are asked about our objectives in Afghanistan and our view of the
                        insurgents, you should say that our maximum goal is a neutral Afghanistan,
                        free of Soviet forces, and our minimum goal is a protracted resistance that
                        increases the costs to the Soviets and galvanizes world opinion against
                        their aggression. (S)</p>
                    <p>You should note to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> our
                        continuing interest in Pakistan’s political development, greater political
                        unity and attention to the needs of minority groups such as the Baluchis.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>In your approach to the Pakistanis, you should keep in mind that, despite
                        their assertions to the contrary, Pakistan deeply needs our <pb n="530" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_530"/>support both in bilateral assistance and in
                        mobilizing diplomatic and other resources. You should, therefore, be firm in
                        presenting our actions and program of assistance in a positive light and
                        avoid any sense of defensiveness about our participation in Pakistan’s
                        security. (S)</p>

                            military occupation. There is evidence that Moscow is disappointed in
                            Babrak’s performance, and rumors are widespread in Kabul that the
                            Soviets are planning to replace him. In the near term at least, there is
                            little chance that the Soviets could put together any government that
                            would be viewed as more than a puppet and have any chance of staying in
                            power if Soviet troops were withdrawn.</hi> ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>Babrak’s regime has virtually no popular backing. Dissatisfaction is
                        widespread in all major cities, and in some instances has resulted in public
                        demonstrations. Attacks by individual Afghans against Soviet troops continue
                        as do clashes between Afghan and Soviet Army units. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>There are numerous reports of passive resistance among Afghan civil servants,
                        and one has indicated that 400 Soviets have been brought in to help keep the
                        major ministries running. Support for Babrak within the ruling People’s
                        Democratic Party is attenuated by a continued <pb n="531" facs="0576" xml:id="pg_531"/>festering of longstanding divisions, aggravated by the
                        pervasive Soviet role in the country. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>The government’s policies are designed to win wider popular support while
                        pursuing basic goals of the Marxist regime. A major aspect of this effort
                        has been to blame the late President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> for the past hostility between the Marxist rulers and
                        the people. The government has made much of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s perversion of the “revolution” in his alleged efforts
                        to turn Afghanistan over to the US and to destroy Islam. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>To correct <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s misdeeds, the
                        government claims it has released 15,000 political prisoners and abolished
                        the secret police. Many Afghans are aware that few prisoners, other than
                        members of Babrak’s previously suppressed faction, have been freed. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The President’s credibility has been further undermined by his appointing as
                        a deputy prime minister the man who headed the secret police until last
                            September.<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">A reference to Assadullah
                            Sarwari.</note> In fact, executions continue at about the same rate as

                        have changed little except their name. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>Babrak also has tried with scant success to prove that his government is not
                        anti-Islamic. His claim that his is the first government in 50 years to
                        allow religious freedom is unlikely to impress a population that equates
                        Marxism and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> with atheism and
                        views many of the reforms the government advocates as antireligious. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not

                    <p>The cabinet still represents little more than the various groups that joined
                        the first Marxist government established after the coup in April 1978. The
                        three ministers who do not belong to the party hold minor positions.
                        Moreover, because of their association with Babrak, they are popularly
                        regarded as having been long-time secret Communists or Soviet agents. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>A recent deemphasis on the role of the party—it is now said to have only the
                        “leading” role in the “revolution”—probably has been too slight to change
                        the popular view of the government. The suppression of opposition by
                        previous governments has left few organizations to join the “Fatherland
                        Front” Babrak reportedly plans to form. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>There is little chance that nonparty figures of any prominence at any level
                        can be persuaded to support the government unless there is <pb n="532" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_532"/>a major shift in its orientation. Most such

                    <p>The Marxists’ broad social goals are themselves a major cause of discontent,
                        especially among the Muslim tribesmen and peasants who comprise almost all
                        of the population. They regard programs designed partly to win popular
                        support—such as increased education and land reform—as threats to their
                        traditional way of life. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>One figure whom the Soviets are said to be considering as a possible
                        replacement for Babrak is Commerce Minister Jalalar, a non-Marxist who also
                        served in the cabinets of former King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir</persName> and former President Daoud. He has no independent
                        political following, however, and is one of those whose willingness to
                        participate in Babrak’s cabinet has only convinced most Afghans he has
                        always been a Soviet stooge. There is some evidence that he has been a
                        Soviet intelligence source. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                        another possible candidate. Now a member of the Revolutionary Council, he
                        reportedly made a secret trip to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>

                        might be attractive to the Soviets because he evidently still has some

                        to stem its decline. <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qader</persName>’s
                        prospects probably have dimmed, however, in light of the anti-Soviet

                        people is a process that will take years and require extensive Soviet

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>Even before the December 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistan’s economy was
                        faltering and its minimal economic gains had ground to a halt. Land and
                        credit reforms initiated by the pro-Soviet Marxist government that took
                        power in April 1978 caused major disruptions in economic activity and helped
                        spark the insurgency that has now spread throughout the country. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Kabul’s land reform program, coupled with unfavorable weather in 1979,
                        resulted in a drop of 400,000–500,000 metric tons in wheat production.
                        Government attempts to tighten control over commerce produced frequent
                        shortages of essential goods and led to capital flight by bazaar merchants,
                        who are a major factor in overall trade and economic activity. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Since the Soviet invasion, economic activity has slumped further. The
                        insurgents are hampering food and fuel deliveries to Kabul. In the capital,
                        the Soviet-backed Babrak government has imposed price controls on items such
                        as meat and tea and established special distribution centers for essential
                        commodities. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Longstanding Afghan-Soviet trade and economic aid ties are likely to be
                        strengthened in the wake of the Soviet invasion. Soviet economic support is
                        critical for Kabul now that Western aid donors have suspended their small
                        but important programs and multilateral financial institutions have halted
                        disbursements pending a reviewing of their operations. Even with Soviet
                        help, the durability of the Babrak regime is in doubt because it has failed
                        to rally popular support and it is viewed by nearly all Afghanis as
                        atheistic and anti-Islam. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                            recounted his trip in his memoirs, <hi rend="italic">Counsel to the

                        effectively deter the Soviets from further aggression in the sensitive
                        Persian Gulf area. Projected <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms
                        deliveries to Pakistan would be defensive in character to meet Pakistan’s
                        needs arising from the new Soviet military presence on its border. There was
                        nothing threatening to India in this renewed <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest in Pakistan’s security, or the further
                        development of Sino-American relations. FonMin Rao focused his remarks on

                        Pakistan, which he requested should not take place. End summary.</p>

                        for 20 minutes prior to the larger meeting with <gloss target="#t_MEA_1">MEA</gloss> officials. Foreign Secretary Sathe and Joint Secretary
                        D’Souza (notetaker) were also present, as was Ambassador Goheen
                        (notetaker).</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> opened by speaking of
                        the President’s special interest in India. He also described his own close
                        relationship with the President, which had led to the President’s asking him
                        to come to India as his Special Emissary. The President, he said, very much
                        wishes to achieve better understanding and closer relations with India, and
                        hopes that the candid exchange of views now and in the future can help the
                        two countries get past some of the misunderstandings of past periods. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> then described the
                        seriousness we attach to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the
                        necessity of not letting such aggression go unchallenged. The President
                        wants India to understand clearly the considered reasons behind his decision
                        to provide assistance to Pakistan, and he wants also, through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>, to have a full understand<pb n="535" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_535"/>ing of how India views the
                        situation created by the Soviets’ move into Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>5. The Foreign Minister responded by first expressing appreciation to the
                        President for having sent you (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName>) as his emissary. The closeness of the relationship
                        between the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> gave the latter’s visit a special dimension and
                        assured the authenticity of the views that he expressed. He said also that
                        Indians generally have great respect for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and feel he has a sense of affinity
                        for India. Thus, the Foreign Minister was confident that there was goodwill
                        on both sides and that it could help the two governments overcome friction
                        and setbacks arising from differing perceptions. On strictly bilateral
                        matters, he said, there seemed to be few problems, but, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> had intimated, there were
                        differences in the way the two countries perceived world events. It was good
                        that there could be candid exchanges of view on these differences.</p>
                    <p>6. The situation arising from the Soviets’ action in Afghanistan, the Foreign
                        Minister said, had indeed serious implications. Rather than speculating
                        about what led to it, or arguing about the rights or wrongs involved, it was
                        a situation that everyone should now be seeking to “defuse.” Moreover, while
                        there are no doubt wider implications, for India the paramount concern had
                        to be the new threat of big power confrontation within the South Asia
                        region. India’s concern was how it could pursue its critical development
                        objectives free of these tensions, without the impediments that they
                        threaten.</p>
                    <p>7. Then, speaking very deliberately, the Foreign Minister expressed objection
                        to America providing arms for Pakistan. Any introduction of arms for
                        Pakistan, he said, will not achieve security for that country; it will
                        simply escalate the tensions.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3"><persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> in the Oval Office, February 6,

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>The decision to intervene in Afghanistan has raised the question—as all major
                        Soviet decisions have in the past—of the degree of consensus that existed
                        among the leadership on this action. It has also prompted speculation that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>—the Kremlin’s
                        strongest advocate of detente—is no longer a leading force in Soviet
                        policymaking. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>On balance we believe that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        remains the dominant force within the Politburo and was directly involved in
                        and supportive of the decision to invade Afghanistan. Measuring the level of
                        enthusiasm within the Soviet hierarchy for military action is more
                        difficult. We suspect there were some reservations, but we believe these
                        concerns did not extend to fear for the future of detente, a policy with
                        which the leadership was increasingly disenchanted during the closing months
                        of 1979. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Public statements by Soviet leaders about Afghanistan before the invasion
                        occurred revealed little more than a common concern with developments there.
                        Party ideologist Suslov, who has often spoken out favorably about
                        revolutionary processes in the Third World, implied that Afghanistan was a
                        Communist state worth preserving. This could mean that he was in the
                        vanguard of those favoring intervention. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> was removed from the
                        political scene in mid-October by a heart attack and almost certainly did
                        not play an active part in the Afghan decision. His counsel probably would
                        have been on the side of caution, and his absence from office probably
                        facilitated the choice for military action. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><pb n="537" facs="0582" xml:id="pg_537"/>Because the temper of the Politburo
                        as a whole shifted away from detente, however, it seems unlikely that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>’s presence would have
                        altered the decision. Despite this shift, we have not detected a basic
                        realignment of power within the Politburo. In November, an opportunity to
                        replace <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> was allowed to pass;
                        he is still being ranked second in the Soviet pecking order. Instead of
                        retiring <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName>, the Politburo
                        brought in a 74-year-old <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        loyalist, First Deputy Premier Tikhonov. We have no reason to believe that
                        Tikhonov’s promotion, in itself, altered the balance within the Politburo on
                        foreign policy issues. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s leaders must have taken their
                        positions on the intervention with an eye on their relative standing in a
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> political
                        environment. To the extent that the intervention has undercut detente
                        policies—with which most Soviet leaders had been signaling their increased
                        discontent—so, too, has it weakened the succession prospects of <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s protege Chernenko, one of
                        detente’s most vocal advocates in the Kremlin. The contender who presumably
                        profited the most is <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s
                        party deputy, Kirilenko, who in the past has voiced some reservations about
                        detente. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>If the invasion is a success, those who might have argued against it probably
                        will remain silent. But if the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is
                        drawn into a long, costly military operation that damages Soviet interests
                        on a global basis, the decision will be reexamined. There are already signs
                        of second thoughts surfacing among second-level officials. The outcome of
                        such a debate could have a significant impact on the makeup of the
                        leadership, particularly in the post-<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> era. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>A prolonged, costly conflict in Afghanistan might encourage younger elements
                        in the Soviet establishment to press for a rejuvenation of the leadership.
                        Unsatisfactory results in Afghanistan might also make <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> and Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_UDF_1">Ustinov</persName> vulnerable and subject to removal at or before the
                        next party congress in early 1981. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> might also be faulted for
                        miscalculating the adverse worldwide reaction to the use of military force
                        in Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>The meetings began on the morning of February 2, with a briefing of the
                        military situation by the Pakistanis. It followed the customary lines and
                        concentrated heavily on both the Afghan/Soviet and the Indian threats. The
                        main contingencies which the Pakistanis envisioned on their Western border
                        are the following:</p>
                    <p>(1) Hot pursuit by Soviet or Afghan units pursuing Afghan rebels. The
                        Pakistani objective would be to punish the intruding troops.</p>
                    <p>(2) A Soviet/Afghan attempt to occupy and hold salients within Pakistan. The
                        Pakistanis would seek to dislodge these salients.</p>
                    <p>(3) An attack by India as a Soviet proxy. The Pakistanis say they need
                        additional equipment and a stronger commitment from the United States to
                        deal with this.</p>
                    <p>(4) An attack from east and west with the objective of dismantling Pakistan.
                        Pakistan would require additional equipment to strengthen itself so that it
                        could deter or delay such an attack until the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could come to its assistance. (S)</p>
                    <p><pb n="540" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_540"/>In the course of this military
                        briefing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked
                        whether it would be helpful to the Pakistanis if the Chinese were to
                        increase their forces along the Indian border, thereby forcing the Indians
                        to pull troops away from the Pakistan border. The Pakistani briefer replied
                        that this would probably not be very useful since the seasons for military
                        operations on one border are quite different from those on the other.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>After the military briefing, the two sides gathered in a smaller group for
                        discussions led on the Pakistani side by President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, and on the American side by Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>. <hi rend="italic">Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> opened by
                        putting out that he had learned much from the briefing and emphasizing the
                        historical significance of the current meetings for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Pakistan relations. He read Presidential instructions
                        reiterating American support for Pakistani independence and security and
                        said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has made an important
                        choice in this regard.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">See <ref target="#d187">Document 187</ref>.</note> He outlined our attempt over thirty
                        years to build security and stability in Western Europe and the Far East. We
                        have vital interests there which are inseparable from our own security and
                        our actions have demonstrated our seriousness there. We have made clear the
                        threat of nuclear war in Europe and showed ourselves ready to shed blood in
                        the Far East. The President has, in addition now, indicated that American
                        vital interests are engaged in Southwest Asia.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">An apparent reference to <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s January 23 State of the Union address and his
                            enunciation of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            Doctrine.</note> (S)</p>
                    <p>In defending these vital interests we have a choice between a purely maritime
                        strategy on the one hand, and on the other an involvement on the mainland.
                        We have chosen not to adopt a purely maritime strategy because we have faith
                        in Pakistan and in the future of the relationship. We are just at the
                        beginning of a new stage with the relationship, not one that is going back
                        to the 1950’s, but one in which we will stand by you since we believe you
                        are prepared to stand up on your own. (S)</p>
                    <p>After some discussion of the global threat and Soviet moves in Afghanistan,
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> returned to the
                        points made in the briefing concerning the threats to Pakistan. He said
                        there are four areas of response to the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan
                        (leaving aside for the time being bilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistani issues):</p>
                    <p>(1) The first is a broad, strong and continuing international response.</p>
                    <p><pb n="541" facs="0586" xml:id="pg_541"/>(2) It is important to keep the
                        Soviets occupied within Afghanistan so as to raise the cost to them and
                        prevent a quick consolidation of an operating base.</p>
                    <p>(3) There is a need for a multilateral effort with United States
                        participation to strengthen Pakistani capability to withstand especially the
                        lower levels of Soviet aggression. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> added that Iran must be included in this at some
                        time and wondered whether Pakistan could help. He noted that the American
                        people were deeply resentful about Iran but were also mature enough to put
                        this matter behind them once the issue is resolved. (S)</p>
                    <p>(4) We must convince the Soviets of an American response if they impose a
                        challenge beyond Pakistan’s capabilities. (S)</p>
                    <p>These four considerations in turn define minimum and maximum objectives for
                        Afghanistan itself. The maximum objective would be the establishment of a
                        neutral Afghan government without any Soviet presence. The minimum objective
                        is protracted Soviet involvement in the suppression of the Afghan people.
                        The former of these is harder to obtain; thus it should be made politically
                        and militarily costly for the Soviets to continue on with their actions. On
                        the political front you and other Muslim nations might propose a
                        neutralization by an international Muslim force. This would put the Soviets
                        on the defensive and belie the idea of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistani collusion. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        went on to discuss the progress which we had made in the four objectives he
                        had mentioned above. He noticed that the Islamabad conference had been
                        remarkably successful in bringing international pressure to bear on the
                        Soviets as had the vote in the United Nations.<note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4">On the Islamic Conference, see <ref target="#d184fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 184</ref>. On the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> vote,
                            see <ref target="#d136fn6">footnote 6, Document 136</ref>.</note> He
                        praised Pakistan for its role in both of these. It is important to insure
                        that there is a more intense and more sustained response in this case than
                        there was at the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The United States
                        leadership is determined to make this stick. (S)</p>
                    <p>On the second point we need to consult more closely. This is a delicate
                        matter that needs to be handled with determination. We have also discussed
                        it with other governments. (S)</p>
                    <p>On the third issue it is important to strengthen Pakistan’s ability to
                        respond to political intimidation or subversion as well as limited military
                        operations (e.g., the first two threats mentioned in the morning briefing).
                        The Soviets must be forced either to withdraw or to escalate the conflict
                        which would precipitate a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> engagement
                        under the 1959 agreement. It is necessary to examine concrete ways for
                        strengthening north-west frontier. Turning to other concerned regional
                        nations, Dr. <pb n="542" facs="0587" xml:id="pg_542"/><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> recounted briefly some of the
                        results of the <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> visit to China.
                        With regard to India he cautioned the Pakistanis not to prejudge that
                        country in a way that would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We, too, were
                        disturbed by the Indian statement in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        General Assembly, but we do not see India as a partner in the Soviet global
                            design.<note n="5" xml:id="d193fn5">See <ref target="#d163fn5">footnote
                                5, Document 163</ref>.</note> Perhaps we and our allies can
                        encourage them to realize that the strengthening of Pakistan’s security will
                        help them too. We have to be sensitive to India about their concerns in the
                        view of their own role. We do not dispute the dilemma that Pakistan faces,
                        but the United States and Pakistan should not become anti-Indian. With
                        regard to Iran, he reiterated our willingness to re-establish relations and
                        look for a new relationship. (S)</p>
                    <p>Pakistan and the United States, he went on, are at the beginning of a new
                        relationship which must be based on realistic harmony. It was impossible to
                        satisfy Pakistan’s immediate expectations, but this must be seen as a
                        long-term relationship. Pakistani independence is important to the United
                        States, and we know that you will fight even if you are not supported by
                        outside forces. We think of you as Poles rather than Czechs. (S)</p>
                    <p>A year ago, what we are proposing to do with Pakistan would have been
                        inconceivable. (S)</p>
                    <p>If the result of our meeting is that our effort is seen as inadequate, this
                        will impact adversely on our historic relationship. (S)</p>
                    <p>It is hard to mobilize others, but by all means do not characterize what we
                        are doing as inadequate. We have to convince Congress five years after the
                        Vietnam war to become reengaged. The threat is one of great magnitude and we
                        do not want to have to fall back to a maritime strategy. We cannot expect
                        100% agreement with you, but we should not leave the impression of a
                        dispute. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName></hi>
                        responded by mentioning three additional points: This is the first time that
                        the Soviet Union has expanded into Asia; a buffer state has disappeared from
                        the maps; and Peter the Great’s will is being carried out. (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> intervened at this point to say
                        that the so-called will of Peter the Great is a forgery.) <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName></hi> continued that the
                        world community’s conscience had been aroused in a way that had not been the
                        case previously. A Russian expansionist movement has engulfed Afghanistan
                        and is threatening Pakistani security and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> vital interests. There is a qualitative geopolitical
                        change in Southern Asia. (S)</p>
                    <p>Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> continued, has a
                        superpower on its western borders and an unfriendly, if not hostile India on
                        the East. Pakistan is looking <pb n="543" facs="0588" xml:id="pg_543"/>for
                        durable and permanent guarantees for its security; thus, they are seeking
                        clarification (assumedly of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        commitment). The Soviets resent the activities of which Pakistan is a focal
                        point. The Indian Foreign Minister demanded a regional discussion of the
                        problem, but <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> responded to him
                        that the problem is global. The Islamic Conference was indeed a victory for
                        the United States and Pakistan, but it leads to further Soviet hostility.
                        Thus we need another superpower as an antidote to the hostility of that
                        superpower. The 1959 agreement must be reconfirmed, especially in light of
                        our experiences in 1965 and 1971.<note n="6" xml:id="d193fn6">The dates

                        these lacunae, Pakistan proposes that the 1959 agreement be turned into a
                        treaty, or else give it a Congressional cover, approval or reaffirmation. To
                        write a new treaty is, of course, lengthy and difficult. (S)</p>
                    <p>How does the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> see implementation of the
                        1959 agreement now? In case of aggression from the West, will it stand
                        committed to Pakistani security? If the threat is agreed on, military
                        assistance should be commensurate with the appreciation of that threat. We
                        have to assure our own security and half-way measures will not be adequate.
                        Certain items will be needed urgently for dealing with hot pursuit, and
                        these will also help to boost army morale. We have to start development
                        activity in the West, and that means economic assistance. How are we going
                        to be able to overcome our problem in the East? Can the Indian threat be
                        neutralized? Can the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approach China to
                        give guarantees to Pakistan? What if the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and India attack jointly? We are seeking to improve our
                        relations with India, but what if we fail? If there is collusion and an
                        attack from both sides will you stand by our side? (S)</p>

                    <p>Therefore, a reaffirmation of the 1959 agreement should address first, proxy
                        aggression from India, second, subversion, and third, it should be free from
                        references to all older documents such as the Eisenhower doctrine, since
                        this poses problems with Pakistan’s non-alignment. It should become a purely
                        bilateral agreement against the threat from the West as well as the East.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>Our position is similar to that of Poland in 1939, when the Germans and
                        Russians wanted territory and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> had no
                        power to uphold the guarantees it had given. Agreements and treaties are
                        valid only as long as they can be implemented. (S)</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has said that the
                        United States wants to give Pakistan the ability to repel and deter
                        invasion. Our commitments are permanent, not transitory. We conclude that
                        the United States is serious and will provide the necessary support. If so,
                        you need not be reminded that limitation to any particular armament is not
                        practical. We must assess the needs and find ways to meet them. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> has said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would “become engaged” in case of a hot
                        pursuit. What does that mean in light of the 1959 agreement? Our experiences
                        are bitter. In 1970 and 1971, refugees went to India from East Pakistan and
                        the Soviets accused us of mismanagement. In 1979, the Soviet Ambassador
                        claims that Pakistan is interfering in Afghanistan by accepting refugees.
                        Also in 1970–71, we told <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira
                            Gandhi</persName> that if she supports the insurgents it would cause
                        similar problems for India. She agreed, but then did exactly the opposite.
                        The Soviets have a tremendous reinforcement capability. If they can move
                        50,000 troops into Afghanistan in four weeks, we can imagine what greater
                        things they could do. (S)</p>
                    <p>Turning to the scope of the Afghan insurgency, when in April 1978, following
                        the coup, we consulted China, we were told that we would get our fingers
                        burned if we became involved. We felt that the United States was not
                        interested in the situation. Even with our meager resources we have alone
                        been helping the freedom fighters. In November 1979, we told Prince
                            <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName> that the Muslims could
                        regain their position if they had help. He, however, said no. But we have
                        been helpful (and with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid in the last
                        few months). Now the Chinese and Saudis have also agreed in principle.
                        Throughout centuries, the Afghans have never been subjugated. The insurgency
                        will continue, <pb n="545" facs="0590" xml:id="pg_545"/>but whether at a
                        high or low level depends on the level of Soviet operations. The Soviets are
                        ruthless. (S)</p>
                    <p>Since December 27th, up until January 20th, 22,000 refugees have fled to
                        Pakistan, showing Soviet ruthlessness. Therefore, the insurgency has
                        prospects but the freedom fighters need outside support. They will need
                        outside bases, and that means Pakistan and to some extent Iran, and these
                        bases must be secure. An insecure Pakistan would jeopardize the future of
                        the freedom fighters and the situation in Iran is still less favorable.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>What is the likely timeframe for the Soviet push further southward? We cannot
                        fix that. It depends on the deterrents at the international level—the United
                        Nations, the Islamic Conference, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        resolve and support—and also the strength of Pakistan itself. (S)</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Pakistan each have interests to
                        watch over. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has
                        talked about vital interests in the Persian Gulf. That is a strong
                        commitment. Is Pakistan included? I gather from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> that we are. (S)</p>
                    <p>There was then some discussion on the exact wording of the President’s State
                        of the Union message, and what the Pakistanis perceived as a difference in
                        strength of commitment between the longer and shorter versions. (S)</p>
                    <p>This new undertaking has a dynamic which we appreciate. Not only the quick
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response including steps already
                        taken, but international efforts as well which we appreciate highly. (S)</p>
                    <p>We had serious differences over a few months ago, and I was deeply ashamed
                        about these. (President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> was
                        referring here to the burning of the American Embassy.)<note n="10" xml:id="d193fn10">See <ref target="#d102fn10">footnote 10, Document

                        stand by our friends. We are facing serious decisions and are at a

                        will find a neglected ally and you will build a dam against the Soviets. Our

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> then spoke concerning the American
                        security commitment to Pakistan. He noted that the President has recently
                        reaffirmed this commitment publicly, and in a letter to President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>.<note n="11" xml:id="d193fn11">For the
                            letter, see <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> We are ready
                        to do more. We are ready to make this letter public, and to ask Congress to
                        reaffirm the 1959 agreement. Asking Congress to do this is highly
                        significant. It would define the Soviet threat (at this point Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> quoted a sentence
                        beginning <pb n="546" facs="0591" xml:id="pg_546"/>“these extraordinary.”
                        Such a reaffirmation would be enacted in both Houses and thus be more
                        binding than an Executive agreement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and I have discussed this with Congress and they are
                        prepared to move ahead. The contemporary vitality of this agreement will
                        reassure you and educate our people. This is an unprecedented way for us to
                        go about making such a commitment. (S)</p>
                    <p>It is also unprecedented that the legislation will provide for assistance
                        “notwithstanding any other provision of law”, thus setting aside the Glenn
                        and Symington amendments and any other obstructions. (S)</p>
                    <p>We need to see this as a beginning of a process. We have to get it enacted.
                        Congress is chary of such things, but at this time it is willing to do it.
                        Proceeding this way is much quicker, cleaner and more decisive than a
                        treaty. You recognize the delay that would be involved in a treaty, and an
                        in-treaty [<hi rend="italic">a new treaty</hi>?] would likely incur debate
                        over various conditions such as non-proliferation. (S)</p>
                    <p>Addressing the contingencies you raised, a Soviet or Soviet/Afghan attack
                        that threatened your independence or integrity would fall under the terms of
                        the 1959 agreement. The President would immediately consult with you under
                        Article I of the agreement, and also consult with Congress. Our response
                        could involve the use of armed force. (S)</p>
                    <p>In case of a concerted Indian-Soviet attack, the first article of the 1959
                        agreement would also come into play. (S)</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets have India attack as a proxy—we see this most unlikely. India
                        is even less willing to do this after the invasion of Afghanistan. The key,
                        though, would be whether the attack was Communist controlled and/or
                        inspired. More important, though, is that the United States and India have
                        good relations. We are pleased that you are consulting with the Indians. To
                        sum up, though, if India attacked as an agent of the Soviet Union, Article I
                        would indeed come into effect. (S)</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>You have talked about “keeping the insurgency alive” in Afghanistan. The
                        issue is one of motivation. To accept an injection of arms to the refugees
                        would be dangerous for us unless we are able to defend against the first two

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> wondered what are the Soviet interests in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that he was prepared to accept the fact that the Soviet motives were
                        limited to Afghanistan itself.<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">An unknown hand
                            crossed out “interests” and wrote “motives.”</note> The Government there
                        was losing its ability to govern and he thought that replacement was the
                        probable motive for the politburo members. However, the rationale for
                        entering Afghanistan is irrelevant; the results are to create a strategic
                        dynamic which is not limited to Afghanistan. The effects of the invasion are
                        of global significance regardless of their immediate interests. It
                        represented a strategic challenge. They have turned a buffer state into an
                        offensive wedge. These acts are very serious. History shows that acts of
                        limited objectives sometimes lead to general outcomes. After all in World
                        War I the parties began with very limited objectives. The United States has
                        been bogged down with the Iranian hostage issue, with the Arab-Israel
                        question, the Mecca problem, Paki<pb n="548" facs="0593" xml:id="pg_548"/>stani problems, etc.<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">The “Mecca problem”
                            likely refers to the attack by Islamic dissidents on the Grand Mosque in
                            Mecca, November 20, 1979.</note> The Soviets may have seen this array of
                        problems and decided that this was the moment to act, but we must be aware
                        of the objective consequences of their actions. What the Saudis did in
                        Islamabad is of historic significance. It is the first time that a group of
                        nations has confronted the Soviets apart from the United States. The Islamic
                        states represent a greater challenge to the Soviets than the United States.
                        You represent a revitalized religious renaissance which is on the move.
                        There are sixty million Moslems in the Soviet Union who are increasingly
                        aware of their identity and who are experiencing an intense feeling of
                        Moslem identity. This makes the Soviets fearful.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said that’s true. In the region there is a
                        feeling that the Soviets did not act due to reasons of self-defense. These
                        were offensive intentions, not defensive. They are going to try to
                        consolidate Soviet power and gain back lost ground. The timing was
                        determined by their need to capitalize on the present situation. He noted
                        that in Lebanon we may have reason to expect some sort of conflict perhaps
                        like 1967. The Soviet military posture in the Middle East is not an attempt
                        to resolve the Israeli problem but to bring contradictions between United
                        States and the Arab world more to the front. The regional nations see the
                        Soviet aims; even Iran does, though not the students. The regional states
                        want to oppose the Soviets despite the immense dangers, such as Pakistan. It
                        was not an easy decision to help Afghanistan especially since they were not
                        sure of the backing they would have from the United States and others. They
                        took the decision since they are aware that they are next. However, this
                        situation should not be viewed as a crisis rather it is something people in
                        this region live with every day.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        wondered if that same reasoning applied to Iraq and Algeria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said yes. They see the Soviets as
                        aggressive and imperialistic. Public opinion and government opinion in the
                        region all oppose the Soviet tendency to take what they want by force. The
                        regional states will do what is necessary and they are confident that the US
                        will help. They need to understand how the US will do it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> wondered what his views were on the results
                        in Pakistan. On the favorable side, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> thought that recent talks were successful in
                        standing up to Soviet aggression. However, we had presented what we thought
                        was a sound approach which involved going to Congress and getting a firm
                        commitment as well as providing nearly half a billion dollars in assistance.
                        We are not sure <pb n="549" facs="0594" xml:id="pg_549"/>we understand why
                        the Pakistanis would not accept this as a major first step.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Coon</persName></hi> noted
                        that the Pakistanis were anxious to reaffirm the security commitment.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> wondered if the aid was too small or too
                        big. We had spent six or seven hours discussing this issue at the highest
                        levels of the Pakistani Government and were still uncertain of what their
                        reasons were.<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">See <ref target="#d193">Document
                                193</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said that the Pakistanis think the aid is
                        not sufficient to meet the challenge. They fear the Soviets and India. In
                        order to resist they have legitimate defense needs to defend themselves. You
                        said that the United States would oppose the Soviets, however, they do not
                        see the US as willing to enter into a direct conflict in this area. For
                        example, to have troops available to defend Afghanistan. Maybe this was not
                        mentioned by them. But they are looking for a clear view of the extent of
                        backing by the US Government. They have no other source to back them. They
                        wanted to have US aid sufficient to have the capability to resist the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> said to Prince Saud you know our country.
                        When we reverse course sometimes that is done in increments. We have a long
                        series of problems to overcome particularly the nonproliferation issue. We
                        tried to persuade them that a half billion dollars is not insubstantial. We
                        talked ourselves blue in the face and we came away perplexed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said they are afraid the US will throw
                        them in front of the bear and not help them when the chips are down. They
                        also have a problem justifying their policy internally. They also recognize
                        the turnaround by the United States but they wonder if assistance will come
                        in time and be sufficient in quantity.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> wondered if they wanted to turn off our
                        turnaround.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said he thought not. We are able to match their commitment to fight with our
                        willingness to assist them in case of massive intervention by the Soviet
                        Union in accordance with our constitutional processes. Did the Islamic
                        Conference agree to supply aid to Pakistan?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said yes and there will be more when
                        others see the US commitment.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said if the Soviets intervene massively we will not stand by. They now
                        understand that. If intervention comes in a limited <pb n="550" facs="0595" xml:id="pg_550"/>way we want to be able to help on a limited basis. Some
                        suggest that we do not have the power. In fact we have the capacity to do a
                        lot of damage. In Baluchistan, for example, US air power could be quite
                        decisive. Also our conventional capability in the region is substantial. We
                        are not obliged to respond in a way where the Soviets choose the time and
                        place of their own choosing. There are other places in the world where we
                        can do things where we have a preponderance of power. We do not necessarily
                        have to match the Soviets gun for gun in this area. We have the means and
                        our country has the will. We are no longer a country paralyzed by the
                        Vietnam war. We are ready to demonstrate that we mean what we say. Like the
                        Soviets the imperialist Germans said they were trying to avoid encirclement
                        but their diplomacy was so inept they did not succeed and brought the whole
                        world against them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said they think they can succeed in making
                        the Soviets not succeed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said as far as Afghanistan is concerned it requires continuing
                        discussion.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said that if we could help with the
                        Indians that would be a good thing.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said we sent Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCM_1">Clifford</persName> to India
                        and his age was the equivalent of the two of us put together.<note n="6" xml:id="d194fn6">See <ref target="#d190">Document 190</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said that the Pakistanis worry a lot about
                        the <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> visit to India. They
                        hope that the Indians can be persuaded. We the Saudis have no influence.
                        They buy some oil from us and some other Arab countries. Even Iraq sends
                        them some oil. We will do what we can but you must also act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> feels deeply
                        about the shabby treatment she got from the US press.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said that is the same way that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> feels.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said the press has not paid much attention to General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, except during the <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName> affair and the <persName corresp="#p_BZA_1">Bhutto</persName> incident was not a beautiful period
                        of Pakistani history. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> is
                        a different situation. There was a long love affair with India in the United
                        States and there has subsequently been a disillusionment especially among
                        the Left intellectuals. The conversation continued after the group sat down
                        to lunch. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that
                        the Afghanis are very tough. He had visited a refugee camp. However he
                        feared that the Soviets would be more effective than the British had been a
                        hundred years ago when only one out of ten thousand men returned from an
                        engagement.</p>
                    <p><pb n="551" facs="0596" xml:id="pg_551"/><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi>
                        noted that most of the Afghanistan army is joining the rebels.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that we don’t have as good information as we need about the rebel
                        situation, however, we have good information on Soviet dispositions. Thus
                        far the Soviets have not engaged in the resistance with full scale fighting,
                        rather they have focused on the lines of communications. This is a good time
                        for weapons to go in before the Soviets launch a counterinsurgency effort in
                        a big way.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Saud</hi> said that the people in Afghanistan are
                        capable of using sophisticated equipment. They need training on
                        communication, recoilless rifles. Surface to air rifles [<hi rend="italic">missiles</hi>?] would take care of part of their problems. He wondered
                        if we have SA7s by chance.</p>

                        said by chance we do. The Egyptians also have Soviet equipment. The
                        Algerians are fearful of getting involved.</p>

                        been many changes in the world during the year since he had last been here
                        in Riyadh.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that he hoped the changes were in the interests of the free world.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said not everything that happened last year was good; however, we were
                        encouraged by the results of the Islamic Conference and hope that this part
                        of the world has been encouraged by the President’s State of the Union
                        address.</p>

                        said nobody in his right mind would have expected the Soviet invasion in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        noted that he had visited the refugee camps in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that this was a heartbreaking sight. It was the results of the
                        invasion. It was most unconscionable to resort to outright invasion as
                        opposed to other means that were available. He wondered what news the United
                        States had of the internal nationalistic resistance.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that every indication we have is that the resistance is growing
                        steadily. Over the last few days there has been an increased number of
                        clashes between the Soviets and Resistance Forces. The Afghan troops have
                        largely been passive and disarmed but recently there have been direct
                        clashes between Afghan soldiers and Soviet forces.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said this is a very significant development and will give a shot in the arm
                        to the resistance.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that our present estimates show that there are 73,000 Soviet troops in
                        Afghanistan, perhaps up to 92,000.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that these indications suggest that they really got in in force.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that some Soviet troop deployment suggests that they might be
                        considering operations against northeastern Iran.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that there is nothing that is not likely anymore.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said we had a good talk with the leaders of Pakistan. The President asked us
                        to lead a delegation there and tell them that if there was a threat to the
                        territorial integrity of Pakistan, we would not let them stand alone. They
                        understand this. We left a military team to examine their needs and we also
                        discussed with the Pakistanis the best way to make certain that the Soviets
                        are not able to consolidate their gains in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that is very good.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        continued I know that some of these matters were discussed with <persName corresp="#p_TAP_1">Prince Turki</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">No record of this meeting was found.</note> We would also like to
                        increase our psychological propaganda to the Muslims.</p>

                        important.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        continued that Ambassador West will talk to Prince Saud about leasing
                        transmitter time because we feel that the indignation of the rest of the
                        world is shared quietly by the 50 to 60 million Moslems in the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that was true. They have the feeling that this Islamic fervor is
                        against any one act of invasion such as that by the Soviets. He had not
                        witnessed a comparable reaction to any other single act. He thought that the
                        Soviets had not imagined that the reaction would be so intense and so deep.
                        This is very important. They have witnessed an international outcry all
                        around the world.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        said that we think this calls for a response on many levels. Most
                        importantly is the level of the Islamic world. We are also prepared to
                        respond in several ways to help Pakistan militarily and economically. We
                        intend to strengthen our military presence in this part of the world. We are
                        not asking for bases from anyone but we are negotiating with a number of
                        countries for the use of facilities so we are able to respond quickly and
                        effectively to any threat. We will respond on the level of psychological
                        broadcasts as well. We are prepared to work with every country in the region
                        to strengthen security. We indicated to the Pakistanis that the 1959
                        agreement is still valid but we are also planning to work with other
                        countries to organize economic and military assistance for them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> said that our trip to Pakistan was better
                        than anticipated but also different than anticipated. The President had
                        announced that he was prepared to go to Congress to seek nearly a half a
                        billion dollars in assistance, including two hundred million dollars in
                        military credits and other economic assistance. Somewhat to our surprise the
                        Pakistanis asked us not to send this until they had a better understanding
                        of what the reaction of their other friends would be. No doubt Saudi Arabia
                        is aware that Pakistan has enormous needs in military and economic fields.
                        Their balance of payments deficit is greater than a billion dollars a year
                        and even more urgently the Pakistan army needs to be reoriented back to the
                        West, since it is now focused mostly in the East. This move requires some
                        change to the Pakistani military and increased infrastructure. So now it is
                        of great importance to know what other nations can do. We would ask your
                        comments on your evaluation of Pakistan’s needs and your own discussion with
                        the Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that Saudi Arabia had for many years been giving Pakistan very good aid
                        in military and economic fields trying to be as supportive and helpful to
                        Pakistan as they can possibly be. They know that if they buoy up Pakistan
                        economically that people will be able to breathe more easily. Also, they are
                        prepared to do whatever they <pb n="554" facs="0599" xml:id="pg_554"/>can in
                        the military field. They firmly believe that Pakistan should be supported to
                        the maximum possible extent. Psychologically now is the time to rally to
                        Pakistan’s support. If friendly states dilly dally at this point future
                        steps will be more difficult.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName></hi> said he agreed. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is prepared to take unprecedented
                        moves to support Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FBA_1">Fahd</persName></hi>
                        said that they had felt this from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s statements and they are sure that the Pakistani
                        people also feel it. Also it is very important vis-a-vis the Soviets, they
                        did not imagine the response would be so firm and intense. Maybe the Soviets
                        thought they could do this thing and get only some brief reaction then
                        perhaps in the future go on to Pakistan with only a brief outcry. That is
                        why the Saudis have a strong feeling that the people of the world recognize
                        that the US lion has begun to stir. Of course we realize that the aim of the
                        Soviets is to get to warm waters so in fact this aggression makes a later
                        move toward the Persian Gulf more possible. He noted that during Nixon’s
                        first tenure he had forewarned the American Administration about this very
                            thing.<note n="3" xml:id="d195fn3">Not further identified.</note> Just
                        to illustrate graphically the Soviets first thought that they would make use
                        of Iraq as a launching pad against this part of the world. Now they have
                        switched and are using the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> for this
                        reason. Their failure in Iraq led them to attack Afghanistan.</p>

                        the door for later redemption; to make clear by our actions that we object
                        only to Soviet behavior and do not seek to overthrow the Soviet system; to
                        proceed carefully in defending areas of vital interest in order to avoid our
                        having forced on us a choice between defeat on the ground and nuclear war;
                        and to explore ways to maintain a dialogue.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, I recommend:</p>

                        to more stringent strategic guidelines, the completion of contracts already
                        underway and continued delivery of spare parts;</p>
                    <p>—continued honoring of existing agreements at the government level, including
                        civil air and maritime (with good faith efforts to overcome trade union
                        resistance), Embassy construction, etc.;</p>
                    <p><pb n="556" facs="0601" xml:id="pg_556"/>—continued freeze on scientific and
                        cultural exchanges except for routine academic exchanges and other low-level
                        exchanges on a case-by-case basis;</p>
                    <p>—stop further moves with China, especially in military-related fields;</p>
                    <p>—informal explorations on getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan and also on
                        starting up arms control talks, using me and <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> for smoking out the possibilities and possibly by
                        sending an unofficial interlocutor such as Averell <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. I am deeply conscious of the seriousness of the present crisis in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations. My staff and I are
                        continuing to review our assessments and recommendations to be sure that we
                        give you our best advice, both as to Soviet motivations and tactics and as
                        to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> actions.</p>
                    <p>4. We continue to think that Moscow miscalculated the consequences when it
                        went into Afghanistan, but are now inclined to think the miscalculation was
                        more acute with regard to the rest of the world than to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> They probably expected, and possibly
                        intended, a worsening of relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, though not of the breadth and depth that materialized.
                        Perhaps the operation in Kabul was botched, and they had expected a smoother
                        change of regime followed by a call for Soviet support, under circumstances
                        in which world reaction would have been narrower and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could have been more easily depicted as an
                        excitable anti-Soviet warmonger. The line now being purveyed, both privately
                        (including by <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>) and
                        publicly—that even before Afghanistan the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had deliberately worsened relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—indicates an intent to blacken us before
                        the rest of the world and to undermine our policy at home.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviet leaders may actually have convinced themselves that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration is out to
                        do them in. Their restraint at Vienna—their refusal to go much beyond the
                        signature of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, to resolve the
                        Jackson-Vanik problem,<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">The Jackson-Vanik
                            amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 required the relaxation of Soviet
                            emigration restrictions before most-favored-nation status for the Soviet
                            Union would be considered.</note> or to take other steps—signalled their
                        reservations. Their paranoia about China may have been one reason for their
                        mulish attitude throughout 1979. (I have recently read <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter to the President in
                        December 1978 warning against the arming by the West “of a neighboring
                        country which pursues an openly hostile policy toward us . . . we must do
                        what we consider necessary . . . due attention to our defense,” and
                        asserting we were at a crossroads, one turning of which threatened
                        “confrontation and increased threat of war.”) The standard litany of charges
                        against us <pb n="557" facs="0602" xml:id="pg_557"/>also includes many other
                        items including <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and the Middle East,
                        about which the Soviets also feel strongly. It is odd that our China policy
                        has dropped out of this litany, for example as recited by <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> to me last week.<note n="4" xml:id="d196fn4">See <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note> It
                        probably means that they think talking about it may be counter-productive,
                        that we are too far along the road of working closely with China to be
                        deflected by words.</p>
                    <p>6. Of course the great disadvantage of the Soviet system is that there is no
                        built-in balance, no one to point out emphatically and publicly the
                        fallacies in the skewed views of the old men in the Politburo. If they
                        decide it is right to try to “teach the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        a lesson,” to show the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> electorate that
                        failure to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will
                        lead to a dangerous situation, there apparently is no one to explain to them
                        that such a policy is highly counter-productive if not dangerous. Since they
                        pride themselves on judging others by actions, not words, it is up to us by
                        our actions to get across to the Soviet leadership that they have misjudged
                        us: we are not trying to do them in, but we cannot be stampeded by a show of
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>7. In these circumstances, the President’s cool but determined approach may
                        have to continue for some time. We will want to show our capability for
                        moving along lines that could hurt their interests on key sensitive
                        points—China, international isolation, a possible new arms race. At the same
                        time we must make clear that we are not trying to destroy the Soviet Union;
                        we are prepared to talk arms control; and we are prepared for the present to
                        move slowly on the above sensitive points to see if the Soviets will change
                        their behavior. We may have to continue along these somewhat limited and
                        constraining lines for several months, if not longer. My guess is that they
                        will not show much desire to talk seriously until they become convinced of
                        the inevitability of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s re-election. Meanwhile, it will be important not to
                        move too quickly on matters they consider affect their vital interests,
                        particularly China.</p>
                    <p>8. I want to offer a few thoughts on setting ourselves up for
                        confrontations.</p>
                    <p>A. There is an obvious danger that one side or the other will make a mistake
                        about the other side’s determination and perception of its own interests. It
                        is of course vital to communicate one’s own perception of vital interests,
                        as the President has done with regard to the Persian Gulf region. A great
                        danger arises however if we assume that the threat of direct military combat
                        between Soviet and American forces will cause Moscow to back away and that
                        therefore only token forces will be required to make the threat valid.</p>
                    <p><pb n="558" facs="0603" xml:id="pg_558"/>B. I can see at least two
                        circumstances in which the Soviets would not eschew local hostilities. One
                        would be that they consider their own vital interests directly engaged,
                        therefore giving them—in their eyes—no choice. The other, less likely but
                        not outside the realm of possibility, is that the Soviet leaders would
                        conclude that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must be taught a more
                        powerful lesson by being forced to back away from nuclear confrontation as
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> did in 1962. However misguided,
                        the calculation could be that if <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        theater forces were defeated in, for example, the Persian Gulf area, the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would decline to go nuclear and
                        that the shock of this decision would reinvigorate forces in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the rest of the world seeking an
                        accommodation with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>C. But I believe it would be a grave error on our part to continue assuming
                        that the Soviets want to avoid at all costs any confrontation which could go
                        nuclear; I can even envisage some Soviet leaders wanting such a
                        confrontation if they expect (however naively) to be able to pre-ordain an
                        American backdown by arranging it at a time and place of their choosing. At
                        the moment they face a new arms race—both strategic and theater—even if
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is ratified; the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> may be seen as moving toward a military
                        alliance with China; and the Soviet economy is rapidly losing momentum. They
                        may feel that if a confrontation must come, it should be sooner rather than
                        later.</p>
                    <p>D. My point is that we should not bluff in moving toward confrontation with
                        the Soviets at this stage in history and at a point near their borders:
                        tripwire forces may not deter them, and might even invite their attack; they
                        may not believe any threats to use tactical nuclear weapons; and if we are
                        forced to use them I personally believe the worst predictions about
                        escalation will come true.</p>
                    <p>9. I also have some other policy suggestions, flowing from the above analysis
                        and in most cases not much different from what we are already doing.</p>
                    <p>A. A general point is that we should not give Moscow grounds to believe that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> follows a policy of trying to
                        destroy, fragment or overturn the Soviet regime; if the Soviet leadership
                        comes to that conclusion its inferiority complex could result in a “cornered
                        rat” syndrome and a turn toward calculated confrontation.</p>
                    <p>B. Our remaining “China cards” should not be played this year, particularly
                        those which appear to be intended to build up Chinese military potential,
                        because that too could support any inclinations here to seek a confrontation
                        with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> sooner rather than later.
                        Moreover, once played they lose their usefulness as leverage and become
                        excuses for Soviet counterreaction. And they help unify the Soviet people
                        behind the Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>C. Obviously the various sanctions imposed after Afghanistan must be
                        maintained for an extended period unless Soviet policy gives us <pb n="559" facs="0604" xml:id="pg_559"/>cause to ease off. The lesson we are trying
                        to teach by means of the sanctions will be easily dissipated if we do not
                        assiduously maintain them.</p>
                    <p>D. A corollary is that having administered the lesson (of which the Olympics
                        boycott is important and deserves determined follow-through), we should
                        stand back and await the results. Continued dribbling out of further
                        sanctions beyond those specified by the President will give the impression
                        of terminal anti-Sovietism rather than a stern lesson. Moreover, we ought to
                        save a few measures for counter-retaliation for any Soviet retaliation
                        against our sanctions and as new sanctions in the event of further Soviet
                        misbehavior.</p>
                    <p>E. Another point about economic sanctions: Our policy of stern application of
                        sanctions even to the point of self-sacrifice, if it is to have any chance
                        of contributing to improved Soviet behavior, must also leave open the
                        possibility of some day resuming normal trade relations. I would be deeply
                        concerned in this regard if we were to cut off completely the delivery of
                        contracted items and particularly of spare parts. It would be satisfying
                        indeed to see major Soviet projects grind to a halt until they can arrange
                        alternate suppliers or install new machines not dependent on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> spare parts. But this would only be a
                        temporary setback to them, while signalling that we have written off <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet trade for decades to come. I
                        believe that would be a dangerous signal to send. Instead I recommend that
                        contracts which are signed and well launched, as well as normal spare parts
                        supplies, should be obstructed only if a good case can be made under
                        revised, more stringent strategic guidelines. I am not concerned about the
                        political consequences of discouraging new deals even in totally
                        non-strategic areas during the coming year; this conveys the proper message
                        and is in tune with our policy on agricultural exports.</p>
                    <p>F. Scientific, cultural and educational exchanges should be an important part
                        of our long-term repeat long-term strategy, because they can be helpful in
                        gradually opening up this society to the kind of counterpressures against
                        foreign adventurism and domestic repression which we would like to see gain
                        a foothold. But since that internal process will require decades, at the
                        present juncture we can afford to proceed tactically and we should therefore
                        continue to hold down large-scale and visible exchanges (while if possible
                        preserving the basic academic exchanges) until the Soviets give good reason
                        for us to signal that they are worthy partners in this sort of endeavor.</p>
                    <p>G. The most important and urgent positive signal is the one we have already
                        given, that we are prepared even now to continue the arms control dialogue.
                        Tactics and timing are important and are discussed below.</p>
                    <p>H. Finally, there is the urgent question of the struggle for the support of
                        the rest of the world in opposing Soviet external aggression. It <pb n="560" facs="0605" xml:id="pg_560"/>is still true that the Soviets, when they
                        think their backs are to the wall, will pursue what they see as their vital
                        interests without regard to world opinion. But it is also true that they
                        have gradually come to place increased weight on their acceptance by the
                        rest of the world. This is a positive development and it is obvious that we
                        should exploit it to the fullest. Without trying to spell out specifics, I
                        would merely comment that it is important that while organizing the power to
                        resist Soviet aggression we also continue the effort to persuade the neutral
                        and non-aligned countries to put political pressure on the Soviets. India
                        and the Islamic countries are obviously important in this regard. How we
                        approach the Third World as a whole is outside my competence, but even from
                        here it seems obvious that simply appealing to them to be anti-Soviet may
                        strike them as self-serving. One of our Western friends here, with much
                        Third World experience, has urged that we approach the developing nations in
                        terms of helping them achieve their own goals and aspirations.</p>
                    <p>10. Recommendations on mechanics and timing.</p>
                    <p>A. It is important that we continue to take a tough stance, not appearing to
                        have second thoughts about our present course, even while leaving openings
                        for the Soviets to signal willingness to start talking about some of the
                        most serious issues. This will not be easy but deserves our best
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>B. Obviously a key element will be continued dialogue between you and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> through both me and
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>. As we have seen in the
                        most recent exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> has
                        begun offering “personal ideas” for a solution of the Afghanistan problem
                        itself; the tactic is to get Washington to venture out on a limb on the
                        basis of <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>’s suggestions. You
                        might wish to respond by feeding me some ideas to give <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>, also on a “personal” basis. That
                        way we get some reaction from <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> first hand without committing you and the President
                        to anything. This could be done even more unofficially by using <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> (who is expected to be back to work
                        soon). I am frankly not optimistic that we could find any basis for an early
                        Soviet withdrawal, but I see an advantage in dangling some ideas for letting
                        the Soviets extract themselves gracefully if they are so inclined. At least
                        we could find out for sure whether they are so inclined. Movement toward an
                        internal regime of “national reconciliation” together with some sort of
                        effort to repatriate the refugees back from Pakistan and pacify the border
                        seems unlikely at this stage, but there would be no harm in exploring it if
                        it could be done unofficially. Perhaps some <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> involvement would be feasible. Conceivably we could also
                        discuss some sort of “hands off” agreement regarding Iran.</p>
                    <p>C. We need to follow up quickly on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I
                        and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II interim observance (<persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not respond to that portion of
                        my démarche) <pb n="561" facs="0606" xml:id="pg_561"/>and, even without
                        waiting for a solution in Afghanistan, to pursue explorations about <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> talks, and about how to prepare for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III. Perhaps Washington will conclude
                        that talks could be held behind the scenes at the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> [<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_CCD_1">CCD</gloss></hi>?], augmented and kept in continuous session for the
                        purpose, or perhaps you would wish to develop a scheme along the lines of my
                        suggestion for a new joint committee of experts to explore the possibilities
                        for balanced unilateral restraint. In any case I think we should settle on
                        some coherent proposal and then begin to explore it, also in an unofficial
                        way through “personal ideas” which I would float or some other means. (Of
                        course we have to be careful not to appear too eager on interim observance
                        of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, lest they decide to shake us up
                        by indicating doubt that interim observance can continue very long.)</p>
                    <p>D. One other avenue for exploring some of these ideas informally would be to
                        send Averell <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> over on a
                        private visit.<note n="5" xml:id="d196fn5">No record of a visit by <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> to Moscow was found.</note>
                        He would have access to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> and
                        other leaders and would be taken seriously, but he could also discuss these
                        issues informally and unofficially. If <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> is too political and too closely connected to the
                        administration, you might consider someone else, perhaps a businessman with
                        good connections here.</p>
                    <p>E. The measures we have taken thus far have had a three-fold purpose: showing
                        the Soviets that such behavior cannot be cost-free; deterring future
                        aggressive behavior; and, ideally, forcing a roll-back in Afghanistan. The
                        first point we will have made if we stay the course. If we succeed in the
                        second one—deterrence—the effort will have been well worth it, particularly
                        if we were able to gain believable commitments against future such actions.
                        But realistically we must admit, for purposes of choosing our long-range
                        approach to relations with the Soviets, that the third may not happen. We
                        may be faced with a fait accompli, the continued existence of
                        [garble—Afghanistan] as an [garble—East?]-European style—or even
                        Mongolian-style—satellite. In our actions and our public pronouncements
                        about the duration of the measures we have taken, we need to balance that
                        possibility against the intractable need for that minimum level of dealings
                        with the Soviets which will head off nuclear confrontation.</p>
                    <p>F. It is nevertheless just barely possible that the Soviets are having second
                        thoughts, and we should not neglect opportunities to explore the possibility
                        of a relatively quick reversal in Afghanistan. If there is any such
                        opportunity, it might lie in the early deadline created by the Olympics.
                        Therefore if we are going to give the Soviets any prodding <pb n="562" facs="0607" xml:id="pg_562"/>on Afghanistan while offering to drop our
                        opposition to the Moscow Olympics, we should do so quickly.</p>
                    <p>G. I frankly doubt, however, that it will be successful. It is for that
                        reason, and with an eye to the long-range prospects and dangers, that I
                        think we should begin exploring possibilities for getting back to the arms
                        control table. Some say that it will be impossible to have any serious
                        talks, even on arms control, while contacts are frozen in other areas. But I
                        think we have to give it a try.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The talks with the Saudis were better than a year ago: franker, more specific
                        and more constructive. There is no doubt that your State of the Union
                        message has had a fundamental impact. <hi rend="italic">They now take us
                            seriously</hi>. In Pakistan I believe we convinced the Pakistani leaders
                        that you stand foursquare behind the reaffirmation of the 1959 Agreement. As
                        a result, we neither had to up the ante on the $400 million nor promise a
                        formal treaty.</p>
                    <p>Subject to your guidance, I believe we should now pursue the following
                        items:</p>
                    <p>1. Since the Pakistanis have basically decided to stand up to the Soviets, we
                        may need to increase our military assistance, but primarily in anti-tank and
                        other defensive-type weaponry. In addition to whatever we can raise from
                        others (and the Saudis promised to make a substantial contribution), we may
                        then eventually have to go beyond the $200 million if we want them to be
                        effective in responding to <pb n="563" facs="0608" xml:id="pg_563"/>a
                        low-level threat. Their military position is really deplorable: poor
                        equipment, no infrastructure, little effective communications.</p>
                    <p>2. As a confidence building measure, and also as a way of keeping tabs on the
                        Pakistanis, we should have regular military consultations on possible
                        Soviet-Afghani offensive options against Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>3. We need to find some formula for a Congressional reaffirmation of the 1959
                        Agreement, even if for the time being there is no legislative package for
                        Pakistan. This is psychologically very much needed and the timing in
                        Congress [will] probably never be better.</p>
                    <p>4. To keep India at bay, and especially to prevent the Indians from
                        concentrating all their forces against Pakistan (which makes it impossible
                        for the Pakistanis to build up their northwestern defenses effectively), we
                        should explore with the Chinese the possibility of some Chinese deployments
                        north of Nepal.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">In the right margin, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “No.”</note> This would
                        siphon off Indian forces and keep the Indians honest (though anything along
                        these lines would have to be done very cautiously so as not to precipitate
                        increased Soviet/Indian military cooperation.</p>
                    <p>5. To mobilize Arab support for our position in the region, and particularly
                        to shore up Islamic opposition against the Soviets, we simply must
                        accelerate our efforts regarding the Palestinians. There is no doubt that
                        this matter preoccupies the Saudis, and they are right in saying that lack
                        of adequate progress on the Palestinian issue would benefit the Soviets
                        quite directly. Either you or Fritz should find occasion to underline our
                        commitment.</p>
                    <p>6. We should tell Sadat in no uncertain terms that his public polemics
                        against the Saudis are harming <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></hi> interests in the region—and hence we expect him
                        to desist out of deference to our concern with strengthening <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests.</p>
                    <p>7. We should try to be somewhat more forthcoming on some of the military
                        items urgently requested by Saudi Arabia—and John West will be writing to
                        you on this matter shortly. Most involve symbolic issues, yet of
                        considerable importance to Saudi pride and to their feeling that we are not
                        reciprocating for their help with regard to oil production.<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">In the right margin, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “These are not known by me.”</note></p>
                    <p>8. If the positive news regarding Yemeni accommodation to Saudi demands
                        proves (as is quite possible) to be false, we should actively cooperate with
                        the Saudis in the implementation of the plan developed by <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName>. Otherwise Yemen will be your
                        next major crisis—and this time in an area directly of vital importance to
                        us.</p>
                    <p><pb n="564" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_564"/>9. In our next communication to the
                        Soviets we should tell them unambiguously that continued Soviet/Cuban
                        build-up of South Yemen is unacceptable and that it will precipitate <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> countermeasures. (Aden is quite
                        susceptible to a blockade and it may be better at some point to seal the
                        place off than to be faced with a genuinely effective <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> challenge—backed by the Soviets and the
                        Cubans—to Saudi Arabia.)</p>
                    <p>10. As soon as practicable and welcomed by host Middle Eastern countries,
                        some amphibious marine landings and a joint exercise with a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> airborne brigade would provide a credible
                        and impressive display of our ability—and therefore will—to project
                        effective American power into the region.</p>
                    <p>These summary recommendations will need to be staffed out and more fully
                        considered, but your reactions to them would be helpful. In brief, we must
                        capitalize on the extraordinarily effective impact of your recent speech on
                        an area which is simultaneously vital to us and yet extraordinarily fragile
                        and vulnerable.<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4">At the bottom of the memorandum,

                    <p>The meeting was devoted almost entirely to a report by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> on their mission to Pakistan
                        and Saudi Arabia. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        noted that the assessment of the situation by both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
                        is graver than ours. They both see Soviet actions as part of a deliberate
                        strategic challenge to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the
                        region. The Pakistanis see four options facing them:</p>
                    <p>1. Possible Soviet penetration of their borders.</p>
                    <p>2. Soviet penetration and retention of some territory.</p>
                    <p>3. Aggression against Pakistan by India, possibly Soviet-inspired.</p>
                    <p>4. A coordinated Soviet-Indian attack against Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The Pakistanis believe they can handle the first contingency. They are
                        worried about the second since it might be intended to humiliate them and
                        they would probably lack the capability to eject Soviet forces. The third is
                        a major concern, since they are convinced that the Indians are aggressively
                        minded and in league with the Soviets. The fourth would be a calamity for
                        them, and only superpower intervention could stave off a major defeat.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>The Pakistani objectives in the talks was to upgrade the 1959 Agreement to
                        the status of a treaty, to increase the aid package about [<hi rend="italic">above</hi>] $400 million, and to keep their options open regarding
                        possible opposition or accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The latter was probably a device to keep pressure on us
                        on the other two points. In fact, they have taken a rather firm
                        position—both at the Islamic Conference and in the final communique of this
                        trip—opposing the Soviets.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">For the text of the
                            joint <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistani statement issued on
                            February 3, see the Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                            March 1980, p. 65.</note> Accommodation does not appear to be a genuine
                        option for them. The party was impressed by the evident determination of
                        Pakistan to fight if need be to protect its independence. After intensive
                        discussions, it was agreed that we would not present the aid package to
                        Congress until we had sounded out other powers about the assistance they
                        could provide. It has not been decided exactly how to proceed with
                        Congressional affirmation of the 1959 commitment, but the initial reaction
                        of the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> was that <pb n="566" facs="0611" xml:id="pg_566"/>the legislation on the 1959 agreement and waiver of the
                        Symington Amendment should only be presented to Congress in the context of a
                        specific aid proposal, rather than being sent up independently. The
                        Pakistanis were evasive on non-proliferation. In the initial series of
                        talks, there was some indication that a nuclear explosion might be imminent,
                        but this was probably a negotiating tactic and was specifically denied later
                        by <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>. (S)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> noted that the
                        Pakistanis appear to be considering an “Islamic option,” which would include
                        a security umbrella from the United States but rely primarily on the Islamic
                        states for the bulk of direct support and cooperation.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">In the left margin, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “good.”</note> The Pakistanis were very
                        pleased by the degree of support they received at the Islamic Conference,
                        and they may find this an attractive alternative to a total reliance on the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> However, they did not seem to have
                        thought this through, and the exact form of an “Islamic option” remains very
                        unclear at this point. In general, the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                        thought that such an option could be entirely consistent with what we are
                        trying to do. The nature of the security umbrella and the exact role of our
                        cooperation would have to be defined much more precisely. (S)</p>
                    <p>In Saudi Arabia, the mission was struck by the change of mood from a year
                        ago. The Saudi response to our proposals for a closer security relationship
                        was much more positive. Both the Saudis and the Pakistanis seem to have
                        reacted very positively to the President’s State of the Union address and
                        the explicit security commitment which it announced. The Saudis took an
                        alarmist view of the situation in the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, including a report of Soviet and Cuban troop exercising there
                        which we cannot confirm. They asked for more reconnaissance overflights. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> noted that our
                        overflights along the border had failed to discover any useful information,
                            [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. The Saudis complained
                        about the slowness and inadequacy of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response to their requests for advanced military
                        equipment. They outlined the levels of aid they were prepared to provide to
                        Pakistan but asked that these numbers be very tightly held and, if
                        necessary, that the actual levels be revealed by the Pakistanis rather than
                        us.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The following are the main points that arose in your discussion with General
                        Akhtar in Islamabad on February 3:</p>
                    <p>—He explained that he has a very small organization for his Afghan operation
                        which handles everything involved. In the Pakistan government, only
                        President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> is aware of it.</p>
                    <p>—To your question about what he is receiving, he gave you a satisfactory
                        answer, noting the same numbers in categories of support as you had in your
                        talking paper.</p>
                    <p>—He is proceeding very cautiously both in technique of transportation and in
                        quantity of equipment and actions. To prove to you the results are concrete,
                        not phoney, he promised to send through “other channels” some
                        photographs.</p>
                    <p>—You asked about <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> debriefing of more
                        personnel. He declined to make them available because it is his policy to
                        allow no one to return to Afghanistan once he has been exposed to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or Pakistani intelligence officials. If
                        some are wounded and unable to return, they could be turned over for a
                        debrief.</p>
                    <p>—He admitted that some cross-border fire and very small border clashes have
                        occurred.</p>
                    <p>—He has pulled together the six political leaders from the Afghan resistance
                        and told them that support is dependent upon their cooperation and combined
                        planning. They are obliging.</p>
                    <p>—When you asked what else we can do to help, he asked for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] of Soviet formations and
                        movements, particularly on the Soviet side of the Afghan-Soviet border. You
                        promised to look into it upon return to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                    <p>—Akhtar also registered a complaint about our request through Defense
                        channels for the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss>–135 flight. Keep it in
                        intelligence channels, he begged!</p>
                    <p><pb n="568" facs="0613" xml:id="pg_568"/>—Finally, Akhtar expressed
                        disappointment that we had not reached more concrete results in negotiating
                        the modalities of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistani aid during

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The American offer of US$200 million in military assistance to Pakistan
                        remains completely unacceptable and personally demeaning to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq</persName>, according to
                        Lt. Gen. Akhtar Abdul Rahman, Director General of the Pakistan
                        Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (<gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss>), who spoke privately about the matter on 5 February 1980.
                        Rahman said that when he talked with National Security Advisor <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had wanted Rahman to convey the message that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Pakistan must keep talking to find a
                        solution to the problem. Rahman quoted <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> as saying that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> would do whatever the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> wanted, including an agreement in writing, to confirm the
                        fact that he has sided with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> against
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Rahman expressed the view that a
                        way must be found to develop a new package. He said he was embarrassed at
                        the failure of the <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> talks
                        because he (Rahman) had urged <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> to
                        look forward to those meetings with the expectation that there would be some
                        improvement in the US$400 million total package.</p>
                    <p>2. Rahman commented further that there is a very strong anti-Pakistan,
                        leftist lobby in Iran which is feeding reports to Pakistan officials to the
                        effect that Iran is opposed to Pakistan accepting any <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid. Rahman believes that these reports
                        are encouraged by the Soviets. The reports are being used nonetheless, said
                        Rahman, by some Pakistan officials as an argument against acceptance of
                        American aid.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p><hi rend="roman">(S) The Soviets apparently are using the current government
                            to restart the Afghan revolution in the moderate direction in which they
                            had hoped both <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> would proceed. Despite
                            numerous conciliatory gestures and the announcement of a “Fatherland
                            Front,” members of the new government are leftists and Communists. They
                            do not represent a broad national front and are instead a Soviet puppet
                            government. Lacking credibility, legitimacy, and popular support, the
                            government’s authority extends to those areas where it can be backed
                            primarily with Soviet military power, on which it depends for
                            survival.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="roman">(S/</hi>[<hi rend="italic">handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]<hi rend="roman">) Babrak’s regime, installed by
                            Soviet paratroops on 27 December, has been troubled by serious
                            instability. Babrak’s Parcham group is engaged in a power struggle to
                            consolidate its control of the new government and consequently has not
                            addressed the nation’s problems, which are largely out of control. His
                            Soviet mentors are displeased with the regime they installed, and
                            especially with the incessant factional strife. They, however, rather
                            than Babrak, will decide the outcome of the power struggle, and his
                            tenure is likely to be brief. The Soviets have little to lose in
                            experimenting with the government to find a leadership combination that
                            might be capable of establishing tolerable conditions in the country.
                            Under current conditions, their chances to do so seem very slim. In the
                            short term, the Army officer corps, which is almost the only functioning
                            national-level organization, is likely to assume a larger political
                            role. The Soviets, however, have invested heavily in Afghanistan’s
                            future. By the mid-1980s, thousands of Afghans now in Soviet and East
                            European schools will begin to return to their country. These students
                            are the future leaders of a Communist Afghanistan, which will remain
                            under close Soviet guidance if not outright control.</hi></p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. Minister:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I have carefully studied Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>’s detailed report of his January 30 meeting with you
                        and reflected on my discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> since his return from Moscow.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>’s

                            outlined in telegram 21582 to Moscow, January 25. The Department noted
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> had no new official
                            messages to communicate to <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, but underscored that the Soviet leadership felt its
                            Afghanistan policy was “justified” and was “aggrieved” by the negative
                            worldwide reaction to the intervention. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            P880029–0990)</note> Clearly there is a high risk of miscalculation
                        between us. In order to avoid this danger, I am writing you privately and
                        personally to make clear our actions and policies.</p>
                    <p>As the President stressed in his State of the Union message, the relationship
                        between our two countries is the most critical factor in determining whether
                        the world will live in peace or be engulfed in conflict. A series of events
                        culminating in the Soviet actions in Afghanistan have brought us to a
                        critical juncture in our relations. It is vital that both of us give sober
                        and dispassionate consideration to the implications of the current situation
                        for each side’s interests and the maintenance of world peace.</p>
                    <p>Despite the differing political convictions of our two countries, and because
                        of the inherent competition between us, we have sought to establish common
                        rules of behavior which would reduce the risk of conflict, and to search for
                        areas of cooperation which would help produce a more stable world. I have
                        hoped and believed that this might be possible. This will not be possible,
                        however, unless both of us recognize the need to act with restraint in
                        troubled areas across the globe. As events following your actions in
                        Afghanistan make clear, unrestrained actions in any one area inevitably have
                        an impact on our relations as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Our most serious concern at present centers in Southwest Asia. The presence
                        of Soviet military forces in Afghanistan creates a new and more dangerous
                        situation in that region. We do not know your ultimate aims in sending your
                        forces into Afghanistan. We do know, <pb n="571" facs="0616" xml:id="pg_571"/>however, that your action has violated the sovereignty of an independent
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>The continued Soviet military presence in Afghanistan will inevitably
                        continue to raise concerns about the desire of the Soviet Union to conquer
                        and subjugate the Afghan people and the further possibility of Soviet
                        military action against Pakistan and Iran. Both the presence of Soviet
                        troops in Afghanistan, and the precedent of their use there, are of serious
                        concern to Pakistan and other states in the region. The Soviet action in
                        Afghanistan and increasing Soviet military activity along the northwest
                        border of Iran also generate apprehension about the possibility of Soviet
                        actions to undermine the independence and territorial integrity of that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>It should be evident that the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet military forces
                        from Afghanistan is necessary to restore stability to this region. The
                        actions of the United Nations and the Islamabad Conference of Islamic States
                        have made it clear that most of the peoples of the world share this
                        conviction.</p>
                    <p>For our part, we have no interest in seeing a government in Kabul hostile to
                        the Soviet Union. A return to a neutral, non-aligned but genuinely
                        independent Afghanistan would be in the interests of all and we would
                        support such a development.</p>
                    <p>There are similar dangers in the Middle East and in particular the Persian
                        Gulf. It is essential you understand that the United States has vital
                        interests at stake in this region. We are prepared to defend those
                        interests. But if there is restraint on both sides, as befits our two great
                        nations, and respect for the independence and territorial integrity of the
                        states in the region, our respective interests need not lead to
                        confrontation. In this connection, I must note that the substantial
                        Soviet/Cuban presence in the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> is a
                        matter of grave concern to us and perhaps we should search for ways whereby
                        we could reduce the possibility of confrontation.</p>
                    <p>The US has made clear that it supports the independence, unity, and
                        territorial integrity of non-aligned Yugoslavia. In my discussion with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>, he indicated
                        that the Soviet Union does also. We welcome this position. We and our allies
                        have no intention of interfering in Yugoslavia’s internal affairs and would
                        view any effort to weaken Yugoslavia’s internal cohesion or undermine its
                        independent foreign policy with gravest concern, as we understand you
                        would.</p>
                    <p>In his State of the Union message, the President gave particular emphasis to
                        the importance of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in the prevention
                        of nuclear war. It is the President’s intention to press for the
                        ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II at the earliest
                        moment that the political climate permits. In the meantime, as we have said
                        privately and publicly, we believe that observing the mutual constraints
                        imposed by the terms of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I and
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II <pb n="572" facs="0617" xml:id="pg_572"/>treaties will be in the best interests of both our
                        countries and will help to preserve world peace.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Minister, I look forward to any response you may wish to make on these
                        matters and any clarification you may care to provide.</p>

                    <p>567. Subject: The Afghan Situation as of February 9.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Begin summary: We have some strong indications that fierce infighting is
                        taking place within the ruling party’s inner circles. It seems quite clear
                        that there is little trust between the party’s Parcham and Khalqi factions.
                        The reported intra-party squabbles may well have resulted in the wounding by
                        gunshot of one or more Cabinet members this past week, including the
                        regime’s number two man, Vice President Keshtmand. There is an unconfirmed
                        report that the Parcham faction may be preparing to go underground if worse
                        comes to worst. There are also indications that disaffection is spreading
                        further in the Afghan military. Afghanistan’s foreign trade suffered another
                        blow when Indian banks reported they required full deposit coverage for
                        letters of credit. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. The mood in Kabul: Some of our Afghan sources tell us that there is a
                        growing expectation here that the rebel Muslim forces will soon move on
                        Kabul. One such source, who is believed to have good contacts in People’s
                        Democratic Party of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>)
                        circles, says that some of his <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>
                        Parcham faction contacts claim that President <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> is fearful that <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Gulbaddin Hekmatyars</persName>’s Muslim forces will sooner or later
                        oust him. Some of the source’s other contacts say that the Muslim
                        Brotherhood (Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen), with which <pb n="573" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_573"/>Gulbaddin is reportedly closely associated, is gaining
                        many adherents in Kabul, even to the point that the Brotherhood is “almost
                        openly” issuing membership cards to those who wish to join this
                        anti-Communist, pro-Islamic movement. (N.B. It will be recalled that the
                        Brotherhood was a favorite bête noire of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> era when
                        the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> media referred to it as the
                        Ikhwan-ush-shayateen—Brotherhood of the devils.)</p>
                    <p>4. Meanwhile, adherents of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s
                        Parcham faction and the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> Khalqi
                        factions continue to feud among themselves, according to reports from Afghan
                        sources having contacts with both factions. A source with Parchamist
                        connections says that a fierce debate between Parchamists and Khalqis took
                        place this past week when the dominant Parcham faction reportedly bowed to
                        pressure from many of its rank and file who demanded Vice President and
                        Deputy Prime Minister Sarwari’s removal from the government. The Parcham
                        leadership decided to send Sarwari off to genteel exile as an Ambassador
                        (just as <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had done to several Parcham leaders,
                        including <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>, in the summer of
                        1978). The Khalqis, however, according to the source, resisted in having
                        Sarwari (linked to the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>
                        sub-faction of the Khalqis) removed from the regime’s leadership circles
                        since that would reduce Khalqi representation there. The debate reportedly
                        turned to shooting on Wednesday or Thursday, with Keshtmand and some others
                        falling victims of gunshots. Source was uncertain that Defense Minister
                        Rafie was among the other gunshot victims. (Kabul Radio announced that
                        Keshtmand left for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> on Feb. 7
                        owing to illness).</p>
                    <p>5. (Comment: Whether or not the foregoing report is true in all of its
                        essentials, we believe that serious intra-<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> strife is not only going on, but that it is logical to
                        expect that it would take place sooner or later. There are simply too many
                        old scores that various Khalqis and Parchamists have to settle with one
                        another—the Soviet role in pushing for a united front notwithstanding.)</p>
                    <p>6. A Parchamist informant has provided yet another indication of intra-<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> differences. He claimed that the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>’s Central Committee has instructed that
                        all party offices, down to the ward level, turn in their files on
                        Parchamists. The files reportedly include each party member’s picture,
                        description and other identifying data. The informant said that the Central
                        Committee is compiling a consolidated list of all Parchamists, but is
                        destroying their individual files. The Committee is not doing the same for
                        Khalqi members’ files, the informant said. (Comment: If this report is
                        true—and it has not been substantiated—it might suggest that the Parchamists
                        are preparing to go underground, if necessary, and let the Khalqis bear the
                        wrath of the Muslim rebels should the latter gain the upper hand. It should
                        be noted, how<pb n="574" facs="0619" xml:id="pg_574"/>ever, that we have
                        seen no convincing evidence that the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>’s rule in Kabul is about very much in control here and in key
                        provincial areas. We have heard—the bickering, feuding and general
                        incompetence that the present divided <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>
                        leadership is manifesting.</p>
                    <p>7. Further indications of disaffection in the Afghan Army: According to an
                        Afghan source with relatives in the military, the commander of the Afghan
                        unit at Karga (just outside Kabul) addressed officers and noncommissioned
                        officers on February 6 and admonished them to support the “new phase” of the
                        great Saur revolution. The commander praised <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>’s leadership and expressed confidence that the
                        Soviet military, who he said were defending the revolution against foreign
                        imperialist intrigues, would soon leave. A sergeant reportedly spoke up and
                        asked the commander what he really believed about the political situation
                        here since he had earlier praised <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and condemned <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>, then praised <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and condemned <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, and he now praised <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>.
                        The meeting is said to have broken up immediately thereafter, with many
                        officers congratulating the sergeant for voicing a concern common to all. As
                        of yesterday, the sergeant has not yet been disciplined, source said.</p>
                    <p>8. On the economic scene, Afghanistan’s foreign trade has suffered another
                        blow. According to a local banking source, Indian banks have joined Japanese
                        and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> banks in requiring a 100 percent
                        deposit before issuing letters of credit to finance Afghan imports or
                        exports. (Comment: This will particularly hurt dried fruit exports, which
                        are Afghanistan’s main foreign exchange earner, since most exporters cannot
                        afford such deposits.)</p>

                    <p>2. Reftel A summarized the highlights of my meeting with First Deputy Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> on the afternoon
                        of February 9. There follows for the record a fuller account of the
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi></p>
                    <p>3. After <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> had read the
                        Secretary’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        (Reftel B), he said that while I of course did not expect him to give an
                        immediate response he would like to make two or three points.<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3">Telegram 35391 transmitted <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s letter. See <ref target="#d202">Document
                                202</ref>.</note> He began with Afghanistan, stating that, as
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> had already told me and
                        as the Soviets had told us repeatedly both through <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> and publicly, there was only one
                        reason for their having sent troops to Afghanistan, at the request of that
                        government—to repel external aggression. Unfortunately, that reason
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>4. He said that aggression as defined by the United Nations—and our two
                        countries had participated actively in developing that definition—was not
                        necessarily limited to the violation of the borders of one state by the
                        armed forces of another. That which had happened in Afghanistan, and
                        unfortunately was still happening on an even larger scale—the introduction
                        from the territory of Pakistan of weapons and armed units, not small units
                        but large, armed units—was very real aggression. And it was well known, he
                        added, that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had a very direct
                        relationship to that aggression. To try, therefore, to make it appear that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not understand why the Soviets
                        had sent their troops in and their objective was simply not serious. Their
                        sole purpose was to assist Afghanistan in repelling external aggression. “We
                        have frequently stated this and I can again firmly state it today.”</p>
                    <p><pb n="576" facs="0621" xml:id="pg_576"/>5. For that reason, <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> went on, all inventions with
                        regard to plans or designs on the part of the Soviet Union vis-à-vis
                        Pakistan or Iran, or concerning a movement to warm seas, were “absolute
                        nonsense.” If the aggression stopped, if the armed incursions into
                        Afghanistan from the territory of Pakistan “or any other territory” stopped,
                        the necessity for the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan would cease.
                        But only in that case—i.e., when the discontinuance of the aggression was
                        guaranteed—would Soviet troops be withdrawn, and not before.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName> said that he must
                        categorically reject the statement in the Secretary’s letter concerning the
                        violation of Afghan sovereignty by the Soviet Union. The right to appeal to
                        another government for help was one of the elemental attributes of
                        sovereignty. The Afghan Government could do so even in the absence of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter or the bilateral
                        Afghan-Soviet treaty; its right to do so was even clearer, given the
                        reaffirmation in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter of the
                        inalienable right to individual and collective self-defense. And the
                        bilateral treaty meant that the Soviet Union had not only the right but a
                        direct obligation to afford assistance at the request of the Afghan
                        Government. Thus, he must repeat that any assertion that the actions of the
                        Soviet Union violated Afghan sovereignty was absolutely unacceptable, since
                        it absolutely did not correspond to reality.</p>

                    <p>1. While discussing on 10 February 1980 Chinese views of the Afghanistan
                        situation and the late January visit to Pakistan of Chinese Foreign Minister
                        Huang Hua, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] stated
                        that his government had been disappointed by aspects of Huang’s talks with
                        the Pakistanis. Although the Chinese have established direct contact with
                        Afghan rebel leaders in order to develop some idea of the capabilities and

                        the matter further, and the Chinese ascribe the Pakistani reluctance to
                        their concern that meaningful support to the Afghan rebels could have
                        negative consequences for Pakistan with regard to possible Soviet actions on

                        was attempting to move Pakistan speedily on this issue because the Chinese
                        believe it is essential that the Soviets be engaged militarily in
                        Afghanistan in a way which will inflict personnel losses the Soviets will be
                        unwilling to sustain for both foreign and domestic policy reasons. Thus, in
                        the Chinese view, the Afghan rebels must be provided the training and means
                        to render the invasion of Afghanistan costly to the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>1. In early February 1980, Iranian President-elect Abdulhassan Bani-Sadr
                        stated in a private conversation that he opposed the Soviet intervention in
                        Afghanistan, and that he considered an armed Soviet presence there a threat
                        to the security of Iran. Bani-Sadr said that if the Soviets invaded Iran,
                        Iran would fight them with all the means at her disposal. However, Bani-Sadr
                        added, he expected Afghani opposition to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan
                        to increase and to fully occupy the efforts of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>2. Bani-Sadr said that because of current internal turmoil, and because of
                        the Iranian-American confrontation, Iran could not afford to antagonize the
                        Soviets. Nevertheless, Bani-Sadr confided, Iran would give arms and funds to
                        the Afghani rebels, who had recently formed a united opposition to the
                        Soviets. Bani-Sadr added that Iran would also undertake military training of
                        Afghani rebels. Bani-Sadr added that Saudi Arabia was also aiding the
                        Afghani rebels, primarily by sending them funds through Pakistan. (Source
                        comment: Bani-Sadr did not elaborate on Iranian plans to assist the rebels,
                        nor did he mention the source of his information concerning Saudi aid.)</p>

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Salim Azzam</persName>, head of the
                        London-based Islamic Conference of Europe, and still carried as a Saudi
                        diplomat on the British diplomatic list, asked <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> to call February 14.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> had just returned from
                        Pakistan where he claimed to have been personally responsible for the
                        formation of the United Islamic Liberation Front of Afghanistan. He said
                        that he had himself announced the Front’s formation to the press and
                        recalled earlier conversations with <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> in which he had said he had been working toward getting
                        the various groups to agree to a charter.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2"><persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName>’s activities in
                            Pakistan were reported by James Sterba. See “Moslem Meeting is Urged to
                            Unite Against Moscow,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, January
                            28, 1980, p. A1; and “Afghan Insurgents Fight Among Themselves, Too,”
                                <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, March 2, 1980, p.
                        E2.</note></p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> claimed also that he had been
                        responsible for having the Afghans accepted as observers at the Islamic
                        Conference where he had personally assisted them in meeting with important
                        Arab Foreign Ministers.</p>
                    <p>5. Asked if he thought the Front would hold together, <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> says that he believes it will because
                        money will be supplied not to independent groups but only to the umbrella
                        organization. This he had personally made clear to the leaders when he
                        delivered to them “donations” from “private individuals” in Saudi Arabia,
                        Kuwait and the UAE.</p>
                    <p>6. Since he has now come to know the various leaders quite well, <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> said, he has become certain of their
                        real needs. No weapons, he insisted, have been delivered to them from the
                        Peninsula, and they have expressed an urgent need for particular items:</p>
                    <p>—anti-tank weapons;</p>
                    <p>—anti-aircraft weapons for use in shooting down Soviet helicopters from the
                        “sides of deep mountain valleys” as the pilots drop down for low-level
                        reconnaissance and attack;</p>
                    <p>—small arms ammunition.</p>
                    <p>7. In summary, <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> said, it is
                        important to insure that the Soviet stay in Afghanistan is made as
                        uncomfortable as possible; the Afghans <pb n="580" facs="0625" xml:id="pg_580"/>want to fight; the new United Front will hold together
                        as long as money and arms are denied to its constituent parts; all that is
                        needed are weapons. <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> asked that
                        this message be passed to Washington for urgent consideration, implying that
                        he would be the obvious channel for communication between the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and the Front.</p>
                    <p>8. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> thanked <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> for his views but emphasized that any
                        consideration which the Western alliance might give to his suggestion would
                        be complicated by obvious factors, not the least of them being the attitude
                        of the Pakistan Government. <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName>
                        said he had been assured by senior officials in the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> (he said he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, but did not say he spoke to him on this subject) that
                        Pakistan would welcome arms shipments for the Afghans although <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> would, of course, continue to deny in
                        public that any arms had in fact been delivered. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> reiterated that while we appreciate <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName>’s efforts to offer us useful advice,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was not in the business of
                        clandestine arms supply. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> did,
                        however, promise to convey <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName>’s
                        views to Washington.</p>
                    <p>9. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> is believed in
                        London to have a Muslim Brotherhood background and the money for his Islamic
                        Council is said to come from his relation by marriage to Muhammed bin
                            Faysal.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">An apparent reference to the Saudi
                            Prince.</note> He has in the last year sponsored several expensive
                        conferences in London on Islamic issues (from which the Egyptian Embassy has
                        routinely been excluded) ranging from the recent Jerusalem seminar to an
                        early 1979 effort on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName>. We think he is an ambitious man who reflects Saudi
                        foreign policy concerns—thus he is stridently anti-Camp David and was quick
                        to denounce the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in public and in letters to
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_TM_1">Thatcher</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d207fn4">Not
                            found.</note> We are obviously unable to judge what if any links he has
                        developed with the various Afghan groups, but judging by his derogatory
                        comments about <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName>, he does not
                        enjoy a good relationship with the latter. Our guess is that <persName corresp="#p_AS_2">Azzam</persName> knows he will gain important points
                        with <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> if he can attain <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance for the new Afghan Front and he
                        will hope for some kind of answer to his presentation to us.</p>

                        Two broad alternative explanations of <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>
                        conduct are: (1) they genuinely believe it better to rely on Islamic/<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> ties and not get too close to US; or (2)
                        they are playing us to get more aid. Probably elements of both are involved.

                        case). Moreover, <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> Army wouldn’t stand
                        for it, and Chinese would be affronted. So basically Paks have nowhere else
                        to go but in our direction, since neither China nor Islamic world can offer
                        them enough security against <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> plus
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Nor do I see much early military threat to Pakistan. By reaffirming the 1959
                        “commitment” we have already clearly told the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that Pakistan is under our security umbrella. This will
                        serve as a deterrent. In any case, a direct Soviet push into Pakistan seems
                        unlikely (as opposed to hot pursuit across the border or subversion in
                        Baluchistan and/or Pathan areas—don’t forget Kabul’s favorite
                        “Pushtoonistan” theme). Direct aggression (or even large scale military
                        action on the borders) would further harden Islamic and other opinion
                        against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, confirm the US position
                        about Soviet expansionism, and really worry India. Much better for Moscow to
                        play a subtler game exploiting <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> minority
                        problems, economic instability and <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s fragile political base.</p>
                    <p>If above is broadly correct, then a lot of heavy military equipment should
                        not be high on our priority list of what Paks need. A guaranteed supply of
                        Islamic oil at discount prices would be more immediately desirable—and
                        should perhaps be made part of our economic aid <pb n="582" facs="0627" xml:id="pg_582"/>consortium package). So too would be light internal
                        security type equipment, not tanks and advanced aircraft.</p>

                    <p>In an interesting and very frank discussion with Mr. Nathan of the Indian
                        Embassy, he made the following points:</p>
                    <p>—Although the <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> visit to New
                        Delhi was not the “disaster” it was reported to be in the Western media, he
                        said he could assure me that what <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> heard from Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> was the strongest opposition to the <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan that he was
                        likely to hear from any country outside the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss><note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2"><persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> was in India February 12–14. The
                            characterization of the visit as a “disaster” is likely a reference to
                            several news stories that reported India’s “failure” to convince the
                            Soviet Union to withdraw its military forces from Afghanistan. See, for
                            example, Tyler Marshall, “India Apparently Fails to Sway Soviets on
                            Afghanistan Pullout,” <hi rend="italic">Los Angeles Times</hi>, February
                            14, 1980, p. B8; and Stuart Auerbach, “Soviets Reject Indian Plea to
                            Withdraw Troops,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, February 14,
                            1980, p. A24.</note> The Indian line, reportedly, was that they were not
                        prepared to pass judgment on the Soviet motives in sending troops into
                        Afghanistan in the first place, but that they cared very deeply about their
                        continued presence there and the dangers which this posed to Indian
                        security. The Soviets were urged to pull back their forces to about the
                        6,000–10,000-man presence they had prior to the invasion.</p>
                    <p><pb n="583" facs="0628" xml:id="pg_583"/>—The Indians have made a comparable
                        approach to <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> via a special
                        emissary who had known him in the past. Nathan suspected that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s subsequent statement that there
                        were only 10,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan reflected his understanding
                        that that would be a more acceptable level of Soviet force presence.</p>
                    <p>—In a very delicate reference to the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> story about
                        support for the Afghan resistance, he noted that one of the dangers of the
                        Soviet presence was the inevitable temptation to go after rebel
                            sanctuaries.<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">A likely reference to Michael
                            Getler, “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Reportedly is Supplying
                            Weapons to Afghan Insurgents,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>,
                            February 15, 1980, p A1. Referring to this and other news stories,
                            telegram 1487 from Islamabad, February 19, summarized a conversation
                            between <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName>, during which <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> conveyed <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s “very deep concern about these
                            evident leaks,” which raised his concern about whether Pakistan “can
                            confide in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> officials and leaders
                            and take their word in return for face value.” (Carter Library, National

                            comments made by Lieutenant General Akhtar, who was instructed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> to convey the following
                            message regarding the Afghan covert action program: “President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and I are greatly incensed at leaks

                            Afghan tribesmen. Our future cooperation will be jeopardized if there
                            are similar leaks in the future. Some advisors close to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> have suggested that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government has done this
                            deliberately to turn Moscow completely against Pakistan and force
                            Pakistan to accept <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> terms. I find it difficult to believe
                            after recent talks with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> that this is possible. However, my own
                            position and credibility are being undermined by such leaks and my
                            efforts to improve <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistani
                            relations cannot succeed under such circumstances. President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and I request your understanding
                            and cooperation to prevent any further leaks.” (Department of State,

                            1979–1983, Lot 96D262, Box 2, 1979 ES Sensitive, February 1–29)</note>
                        That would mean a widening of the war and raise additional fears in
                        India.</p>
                    <p>—If the Soviets do cross the border, the loudest voice of concern and
                        opposition will be the Indians who do not want to see the Pakistani buffer
                        removed. In their view, however, it is best not to tempt fate by mounting a
                        major and organized resistance effort from Pakistan which will perpetuate
                        the Soviet presence in the name of self-defense and which will eventually
                        draw them into a wider conflict in the Subcontinent. (S)</p>

                            stayed on as Pakistani Ambassador to the Soviet Union through September
                            1980, after which he was assigned as Ambassador to France.</note> The
                        most important part of <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName>’s remarks
                        was his suggestion that the key to the situation in Afghanistan was to have
                        some influential and neutral intermediary talk with the Soviets to get them
                        to accept some idea of an international commission of neutral nations to
                        guarantee Afghanistan’s border, which step should enable the Soviets to
                        withdraw their troops from Afghanistan. The main points of our conversation
                        follow:</p>
                    <p>3. In reference to the Afghan refugee presence in Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> said that this “sanctuary” was
                        basically limited to providing shelter for the refugees and that the
                        refugees were receiving modest amounts of money to sustain themselves. There
                        is no organized military effort and no training. If Pakistan did more than
                        this there would be major consequences. The Soviets, he said, know what we
                        and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> are doing in this respect, but
                        we do [not?] “connive.” The Soviets claim that the mainstay of the
                        insurgency in Afghanistan comes from the “sanctuary” and that Pakistan is
                        the focal point of this activity and not merely a subsidiary to the
                        rebellion. In fact, however, only 20 percent of the insurgents in
                        Afghanistan could ever reach the “sanctuary” in Pakistan. Eighty percent of
                        the Afghanistan insurgency is internal and it can not be effectively helped
                        by the “sanctuary.” If the Soviets actually <pb n="585" facs="0630" xml:id="pg_585"/>believe what they claim, i.e., that the “sanctuary” is
                        a major part of the problem, then it would follow that they must destroy the
                        “sanctuary” in Pakistan and would have to attack Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> thinks the Soviets have a more
                        realistic understanding of the situation, however, and therefore considers
                        this a remote contingency.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> thought the Soviets had three
                        options in Afghanistan. One would be to help <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> consolidate his position. The second would be
                        to change leaders. The third would be to continue their military build up in
                        Afghanistan to control the country. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> thinks that the Soviets would like to follow the second
                        option; namely, to put in the best moderate leaders acceptable to the
                        tribesmen and form a government which could manage these people and
                        eventually establish a political base with grassroots support in the
                        country. Under these circumstances, if there was some proposal put forward
                        by a party acceptable to the Soviets (<persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> specified that it could not be the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>) for an international commission which
                        would guarantee that there would be no threat to the Soviet Union’s southern
                        border, then the Soviets could withdraw their troops from Afghanistan.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> said that this course was
                        not unknown in Soviet history and that they have withdrawn militarily, while
                        assuring the establishment of a regime friendly to them.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> commented that the Soviets
                        have seriously miscalculated the local Afghanistan situation. Daoud was
                        removed from the top and there was no grassroots support for the regimes
                        which followed. The situation in Afghanistan was quite different than that
                        which prevailed in Iran where the Shah was hated and where he did not have
                        deep grassroots support. In contrast, the revolution in Afghanistan is stuck
                        in the mud. Tribal resistance can only be broken by working with the tribes
                        themselves. Nevertheless, the Soviets decided to go into Afghanistan,
                        encouraged by the wave of anti-American opinion in neighboring Iran, the
                        shakiness of Saudis and the burning of the American Embassy in Pakistan. All
                        of these factors gave the Soviets the feeling that they could pull it off.
                        They also seriously miscalculated President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and felt that the liberal foreign policy
                        establishment in the United States would not act, especially in order to
                        avoid a double crisis situation. The Soviets were surprised by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s sharp turn in foreign
                        policy. They, also, seriously miscalculated the international condemnation
                        of their invasion of Afghanistan. For the past 100 years there has been no
                        real threat from Afghanistan. Now, the Soviets have stirred up a hornets
                        nest. They have accelerated events that they dread. For example, closer
                        relations between <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China and Japan,
                        respectively. When the hostage situation in Iran is settled and there is an
                        improvement in Iranian/<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations, the
                        Soviets will be in an even worse situation. In sum, the Soviet attack on
                        Afghanistan has coalesced many nations behind the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                    <p><pb n="586" facs="0631" xml:id="pg_586"/>6. In <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName>’s view, the key to the situation in Afghanistan is for
                        someone to try to talk with the Soviets and to get them to accept some idea
                        of establishing a commission of neutral nations to guarantee Afghanistan’s
                        borders so that the Soviets can withdraw and give them time to build up a
                        stable regime in Afghanistan with which the Soviets can live. The
                        establishment of such a commission would allow the Soviets to save face. The
                        problem here is their belief that revolutionary processes are irreversible,
                        which makes it difficult for them to back out. <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName> said “We ought to line up some friend acceptable to the
                        Soviets to help them save their face and pride.”</p>
                    <p>7. It is completely coincidental, but of interest, that immediately after my
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KY_1">Khan</persName>, I had a long
                        scheduled meeting with <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> Ambassador Wieck
                        who also floated the idea of an international commission. Wieck, speaking
                        personally, proposed that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> try to
                        structure a commission composed of Third World countries to arrange a
                        “neutral policy” for Afghanistan. Wieck was deviously thinking out loud and
                        indicated that what was really needed was a neutralist scheme for the whole
                        region involving Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and, possibly, India and other
                        states. Perhaps, he suggested, this would be a very good role for <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> to play. In any case, any
                        approach, Wieck suggested, should have <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira
                            Gandhi</persName>’s support so that we will not be viewed as the
                        perpetrators of the plan. Wieck also referred to Soviet difficulties in
                        Afghanistan. Wieck mentioned that the Soviet Ambassador to the United
                        Kingdom told a group of British Parliamentarians that the Soviets would
                        withdraw, if the West would guarantee non interference in Afghanistan.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Having read your letter of February 8 I would like to tell you frankly the
                            following.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">See <ref target="#d202">Document
                                202</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>One could only welcome the recognition in the letter of the crucial
                        importance of relations between our countries for the general world
                        situation and the apparent desire to search for ways of overcoming the
                        serious situation prevailing now in these relations.</p>
                    <p>However, the attempt to evade consideration of the real causes complicating
                        the international situation, efforts to reduce the whole matter to the
                        recent developments in Afghanistan depicted, for that matter, in a
                        completely distorted light, and the raising of various kinds of other
                        far-fetched questions—all this in no way demonstrates a real intention to
                        rectify the current situation.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, it is impossible, without sinning against the truth, to dispute the
                        fact that the exacerbation of the international situation by no means began
                        at the end of last December, but rather much earlier. We also pointed out to
                        the US side the reasons for this exacerbation much earlier.</p>
                    <p>Among these is the decision on deployment in the US of the MX mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> system which was made almost immediately
                        after the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty was signed in
                        Vienna.</p>
                    <p>There is also the artificially created “mini-crisis” on the question of a
                        “Soviet brigade” in Cuba.</p>
                    <p>There is also the urgent establishment of the “Rapid Deployment Force”
                        designed for armed intervention in various parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>There is the long-range program of permanent defense spending increases and
                        arms build-up imposed by the US on its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is the decision to deploy new US missiles on the soil of
                        Western Europe, which creates a serious threat to the security of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its allies.</p>
                    <p>And what has become of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty?
                        Incidentally, in taking the decision to develop and deploy MX missiles the
                        US Government <pb n="588" facs="0633" xml:id="pg_588"/>stated that this
                        decision would promote the ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. Without addressing now the substance of the MX missile
                        question—which is a subject for a special discussion—one cannot fail to
                        observe that in fact the decision on the MX missile is being implemented
                        while the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty has not been
                        ratified. In pressing its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies to
                        agree to the deployment on their soil of new American missiles, the US was
                        also saying that this would facilitate the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty. Even putting aside, once
                        again, the question of the invalidity of such linkage, the picture remains
                        the same: the decision on the deployment of new missiles in Western Europe
                        has been adopted and is being implemented, but the Treaty has not been
                        ratified.</p>
                    <p>Try to see all this through our eyes. Can these facts be seen in any way
                        other than as a departure by the US from the principle of equality and equal
                        security which was reconfirmed in Vienna, as evidence of a policy line now
                        pursued by the US to break out of the existing military and strategic parity
                        between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the US, to rush ahead
                        in an effort to gain military superiority for itself?</p>
                    <p>No references to events in Afghanistan can conceal this turn in US policy—a
                        turn from detente to a new aggravation of international tensions, to a new
                        round of the arms race.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you mention the need for our two states to show restraint and
                        moderation in international affairs and in relations with each other. Well,
                        the thought itself is correct. We, on our part, are also in favor of this.
                        It is important, however, for the United States also to adhere to such a
                        course in international affairs and not treat them with such astonishing
                        light-mindedness as it now does.</p>
                    <p>As for Afghanistan, our position on this question has been set forth more
                        than once with utmost clarity, specifically as you know in the answers by
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">L.I. Brezhnev</persName> to the questions
                        of the <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> correspondent as well as in our
                        contacts with the US side.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">See <ref target="#d166">Documents 166</ref> and <ref target="#d186">186</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Facts do not cease to be facts because the US side does not want to admit
                        that acts of aggression against Afghanistan have been and continue to be
                        committed from the territory of Pakistan. Also indisputable is the fact that
                        in providing assistance to Afghanistan in repelling external aggression, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has acted in full accordance with
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter and the Treaty of Friendship
                        and Cooperation between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We have also spoken on more than one occasion as to when and under what
                        circumstances the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan will be
                        carried out. I would only like to stress that if the US really wanted this
                        to occur sooner, it could, of course, take measures <pb n="589" facs="0634" xml:id="pg_589"/>to stop the aggression against Afghanistan. So far, the
                        practical actions of the United States go exactly in the opposite direction:
                        everything is being done to expand armed incursions into the territory of
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>You say in your letter that the US has no interest in seeing a government in
                        Kabul hostile to the Soviet Union. In fact, however, the United States is
                        exerting every effort toward uniting counterrevolutionary Afghan groups
                        under foreign auspices and even toward the virtual establishment of an
                        illegal Afghan “government in exile” in the territory of Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>So, as you see, there is nothing we must justify before the United States,
                        but the list of complaints which we have the right to present to the US
                        happens to be a rather long and impressive one.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the serious damage to the international situation and Soviet-US
                        relations already inflicted by the actions of the United States can hardly
                        pass without a trace. But it is alien to us to be guided by emotions in our
                        policies. We would be prepared, if the United States is also willing, to
                        seek opportunities to return to the path of cooperation between our two
                        countries and with other states for the sake of improving the international
                        situation, strengthening peace and universal security.</p>
                    <p>If, as your letter says, Soviet-US relations are now at a “critical
                        juncture,” then the choice of which way to proceed is up to the US. Our
                        choice is clear. We would like to hope that the US will also make the only
                        sensible choice—in favor of detente and peaceful coexistence.</p>
                    <p>I hope, Mr. Secretary, that you will understand correctly the motives by
                        which I was impelled in speaking in such a frank manner. We would welcome
                        any constructive considerations and ideas in support of detente in
                        Soviet-American relations which you might offer on your part.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    </list>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>One of our problems in dealing with Afghanistan is that we haven’t really
                        expected a satisfactory outcome—i.e., a Soviet withdrawal. Our secondary
                        objective—making the Soviets pay for their actions—is of considerable value
                        but is certainly not a long-term policy goal. Given the Pakistani reluctance
                        to be very involved with us (and the Chinese), I am concerned that, in some
                        regards at least, we may find that we cannot extract a maximum price from
                        the Soviets. The press leaks will make the Paks even less amenable and may,
                        on their own, undercut our position in general. (S)</p>
                    <p>From reading the intelligence reporting, I gather that the Soviets are
                        finding the going a lot tougher than they expected. They probably realize
                        that they are in for a long and costly operation but are no doubt determined
                        to do whatever is necessary to secure their border. I have little doubt that
                        they can succeed ultimately. (S)</p>
                    <p>There is a lot of diplomatic activity going on. The Soviets are dropping
                        hints about willingness to come to a compromise solution. The British are
                        talking about an “Austrian” solution. The President’s comment about a Muslim
                        occupation force has stirred interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">In a news
                            conference on February 13, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> called for Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and
                            a Soviet commitment not to invade other countries, and suggested the use
                            of a peacekeeping force comprised of Muslim troops during the transition
                            period between Soviet withdrawal and the establishment of a neutral
                            Afghan Government. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, 1980–81</hi>, Book I, p.

                        perhaps, is the tough line that India is taking in private while still
                        keeping its options open in public. (S)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Evaluation</p>
                    <p>This all may or may not provide us with something more than diplomatic and
                        propaganda maneuvering space. I continue to believe that all alternatives
                        are going to founder on the Soviet desire to have <pb n="591" facs="0636" xml:id="pg_591"/>absolute security along its borders. But I am no longer
                        as convinced as I have been in the past. They may be looking for a way out.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>The odds are, also, that initiatives by the Sri Lankans, Indians, etc., are
                        not going to get off the ground. None of these countries has a very good
                        track record for effective diplomatic work. The Indo-Pakistani rivalry is
                        also a barrier. But neither of these considerations is absolute. India and
                        the other regional states may just be sufficiently disturbed that they could
                        put something together. (S)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATION</p>
                    <p>Even if the well is <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> dry, I think we should
                        put the bucket down. It won’t cost much, and we could just possibly find
                        something there. Specifically:</p>
                    <p>—We should have an intelligence assessment of how much the Soviets are paying
                        for their action and what the chances are that they would settle for some
                        sort of alternative outcome. We should evaluate the Soviet feelers that have
                        been put out.</p>
                    <p>—We should seriously assess the possibility that the Indians (or somebody
                        else) might be able to play an effective intermediary role. And we should
                        develop an idea of what that role might be and how we should stimulate or
                        otherwise relate to it. (E.g., might the President urge Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> to take leadership; if so, what
                        would we be willing to concede?)</p>
                    <p>—We should consider what kind of alternate arrangements would be acceptable
                        to us and staff them out carefully. (E.g., the idea of a Muslim
                        peace-keeping force has its virtues, but it is not likely to be attractive
                        to India—which is inevitably going to be a principal actor.) (S)</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Soviets have stepped up their military operations in
                            northern and eastern Afghanistan over the past week, but they have been
                            unable to stem the crumbling of the Afghan Army and continue to have
                            difficulty maintaining security in Afghan cities.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Soviet ground forces, led by new field commanders appointed
                            last weekend and supported by fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships,
                            are conducting sweeps in several provinces. The operations appear to be
                            most intensive in Baghlan Province. The Soviets have also moved
                            reinforcements, including tanks and helicopter gunships, into Jalalabad
                            and have launched counterinsurgency operations in the area. They have
                            bombed rebel positions in several provinces surrounding
                        Jalalabad.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Afghan Army, meanwhile, has continued to deteriorate,
                            and there is growing evidence that the Soviets no longer trust the
                            Afghans. Soviet and Afghan units have clashed recently near Kabul,
                            Jalalabad, Nahrin, and other towns (your Brief of Thursday). The Afghan
                            division stationed in Paktia Province has suffered heavy desertions,
                            refused to fight, and may be negotiating to join the
                        resistance.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The continued unraveling of the Afghan Army, together with
                            popular antipathy toward the Soviets, has resulted in a serious
                            breakdown in security in several cities. The situation in Jalalabad
                            reportedly has reached crisis proportions; insurgents control much of
                            the city and also control a checkpoint on the highway linking Jalalabad
                            and Kabul. In Qandahar, a recent Afghan military message said that the
                            city was “lost to the Muslims” and could be secured only by a
                            large-scale attack. Soviet reinforcements have taken up positions on the
                            outskirts of Qandahar but have made no attempt to secure the city. Civil
                            unrest has also been reported in Herat.</hi></p>
                    <p>The security situation in Kabul has also deteriorated. Soviet soldiers have
                        stepped up their patrols and are enforcing a longer curfew. Many residents
                        believe the Soviets are looting shops during the curfew. The police force in
                        the city appears to have disintegrated, and students at Kabul University
                        recently were arrested because they were planning to demonstrate against the
                        Soviets and the Afghan Government. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not

                        dated 3 July 1979 which authorized humanitarian aid to the insurgents.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">See <ref target="#d53fn5">footnote 5, Document

                    <p>The Afghan nationalist rebels are steadily expanding their area of influence
                        as the government forces disintegrate. <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName>, the Soviet puppet, is despised and ridiculed, while
                        increased conflict between Khalqis and Parchamists has created political
                        anarchy. Another change at the top is likely, but another leftist in
                        Babrak’s place would not promise to end the drift into chaos.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan may have been intended to establish
                        stability, but it has had the opposite effect. The Soviets vastly overrated
                        the clout of the Parchamist supporters of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName>, who rules from an even narrower base than his
                        predecessors.</p>
                    <p>The key problem, however, is the popular revulsion to the Soviet presence.
                        Soviet forces were probably expected to stiffen the Afghan army and free it
                        to fight insurgents as the Soviets secured the cities, roads, and key
                        installations. But the Soviet presence has caused army units to evaporate as
                        Afghan soldiers join the nationalists in ever <pb n="595" facs="0640" xml:id="pg_595"/>increasing numbers. Police too are deserting in droves
                        as the rebels extend their control into provincial centers and major
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>Disaffection is reaching into the highest levels. According to clandestine
                        reporting, the governor of critical Badakhshan province recently joined the
                        rebels, and the Minister of Defense, sickened by reports of intensive Soviet
                        bombing of provincial villages, has retreated into a military hospital. A
                        high level Afghan intelligence official has stated, according to a
                        clandestine report, that Afghanistan is “out of control.” While this is an
                        exaggeration, if the trend continues, the regime might completely fall
                        apart.</p>
                    <p>The bitter rivalry between Khalqis and Parchamists, whom the Soviets have
                        unsuccessfully tried to bring together into a reunited party, has resulted
                        in at least one shoot-out at the highest levels of government. Babrak
                        appears to have moved off center stage and talk of coup plots and successors
                        is rampant.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets must be even more alarmed now than when they moved against
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. Not only is Afghanistan in
                        chaos, but their own forces have not performed well and have sustained
                        significant losses.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet dilemma is indicated by the widespread rumors of a Soviet deal
                        with the former royal family. For the moment, however, another leftist
                        candidate is probably more likely to be the immediate successor to Babrak.

                    <p>In telegram 2964 from Moscow, February 22, 1980, the Embassy reported on a
                        speech delivered by Soviet General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName>. With regard to Afghanistan, the Embassy
                        surmised the speech signaled that the Soviets were possibly “looking for a
                        way out” of Afghanistan or, on the other hand, perhaps <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> was making an “attempt to shift
                        the blame to others—especially the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>—for
                        a prolonged Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.” The Embassy went on to quote
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: “The United States
                        loudly demands the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but in fact it is itself
                        doing everything to make this possibility remote: it is continuing and
                        building up its interference in the affairs of Afghanistan. I want to state
                        very definitively: we will be ready to commence the withdrawal of our troops
                        as soon as all forms of interference from outside directed against the
                        Government and people of Afghanistan are fully terminated. Let the United
                        States, together with the neighbors of Afghanistan, guarantee this. And then
                        the need <pb n="596" facs="0641" xml:id="pg_596"/>for Soviet military
                        assistance will cease to exist.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs,

                        East/West, <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName>, Subject File, Box

                    <p>In a memorandum to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus
                            Vance</persName>, February 22, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for
                        European Affairs H. Allen Holmes analyzed <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech, noting that it was the latest in a string
                        of Soviet statements to the effect that the Soviet Union would withdraw its
                        troops once “US-supported aggression from Pakistan has terminated.” The
                        memorandum offered four reasons to be “skeptical” of <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s pledge: 1) it was possibly a
                        ploy to shift the responsibility for the crisis in Afghanistan to the United
                        States; 2) Soviet offers to negotiate with the United States might have to
                        be focused on bilateral issues outside the Afghanistan issue; 3) the
                        ideological basis for the intervention in Afghanistan would preclude Soviet
                        willingness to withdraw because it “would mean the collapse of the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> regime and the establishment in
                        Afghanistan of a government hostile to the Soviet Union;” and 4) the Soviets
                        had recently rebuffed calls by both <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and the European Community for the establishment of a
                        neutral Afghanistan. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss>

                    <p>The conclusion of this memorandum was echoed in a memorandum from National
                        Security Council Staff member <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Marshall
                            Brement</persName> to the President’s Assistant for National Security

                        February 25, suggesting that the string of Soviet statements on Afghanistan
                        “does not represent a genuine negotiating proposal by the Soviets, but is
                        rather a propaganda attempt to shift the blame for the continuing Soviet
                        presence in Afghanistan onto the shoulders of the US and, to a lesser
                        extent, China and Pakistan.” In the upper right corner of the memorandum,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> wrote: “Basically I
                        agree. But it is important to make the Soviets look as if they were
                        rejecting bona fide proposals for withdrawal.” (Carter Library, National

                        2/80)</p>
                    <p>That same day, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>
                        sent a handwritten note to <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        about <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s speech, stating:
                        “Cy—I do not attach much importance to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s ‘olive branch.’ As I said on the phone, the worst
                        thing we could do would be to waffle. We must respond <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> to any allegation by the Soviets that we are involved

                    <p>In the last week of February 1980, a general strike and large-scale protests
                        in Kabul and other Afghan cities posed the greatest challenge to Soviet
                        control of the country since the intervention in late December 1979.
                        Determined to maintain order in Kabul, the Soviet military moved troops,
                        tanks, armored personnel carriers, and helicopters into the center of the
                        city, February 22, in an attempt to break up protesting crowds who were
                        shouting “God is great,” and “death to the Soviets.” ([<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] February 22; Central Intelligence Agency,

                        Later that day, Radio Kabul announced the Afghan Government had declared
                        martial law, blaming the “subversive acts” in Kabul on “foreign agents and
                        mercenaries and British, American, Pakistani, and Chinese lackeys.” An
                        intelligence assessment prepared in the Central Intelligence Agency, which
                        reported this statement, observed that the protest “further undermines the
                        legitimacy of President <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s
                        regime, sets back the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s timetable for
                        dealing with the insurgent threat in the countryside, and considerably
                        complicates Moscow’s efforts to deal with the negative international
                        consequences of its intervention.” ([<hi rend="italic">text not

                        was still at 80–90 percent of its original strength and that the Afghan

                        targeting minority Hazara tribesmen believed to be at the forefront of the
                        protests. At the same time, the Soviet military had set up checkpoints

                        February 27, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] referenced an
                        old adage regarding two of the major Soviet news organs [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]: “There is no news in the <hi rend="italic">Truth (Pravda)</hi> and no truth in the <hi rend="italic">News
                            (Izvestia)</hi>.” The Soviet news outlets alleged that the strike was
                        forced upon Afghan shopkeepers by foreigners and that the rebellion was
                        “past its peak.” (Ibid.) An annex to the same <gloss target="#t_PDB_1">PDB</gloss> noted that the Kabul rebellion had likely hastened

                        conjunction with another change in Afghan leadership—to deter future
                        rebellions. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>In telegram 826 from Kabul, February 27, the Embassy reported: “While the

                        Agency, February 28, noted the strike “demonstrated the ability of
                        anti-Marxists to close down the capital, which previously had not witnessed
                        any previous unrest,” while also illustrating the weakness of the Afghan
                        Government and its complete reliance on the Soviet military to guarantee its
                        position against the Afghan resistance. ([<hi rend="italic">text not

                        AFGHANISTAN:</p>
                    <p>—It is estimated 100,000 Soviets troops are committed to the Afghan invasion.
                        About 60,000 ground and air force combat personnel and some 10,000 support
                        and advisory personnel are in Afghanistan. Some 30,000 troops are across the
                        border in staging areas near Termez and Kushka.</p>
                    <p>—Current analysis indicates the Soviets have completed the first phase of
                        their Afghan invasion. Their lines of communications are relatively secure
                        and their base areas are fairly well established. A second, operational
                        phase is expected in the near future with operations in contested areas,
                        especially in the West and Northeast. As weather conditions improve, and
                        more Soviet forces and equipment are brought in-country, these operations
                        will probably be more extensive.</p>
                    <p>—Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate. Reports have placed Soviets
                        killed in action as high as 1,500–2,000, with wounded at several times that
                        number.</p>

                    <p>—Following the Islamic Conference’s denunciation of the Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan, Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan became characterized by
                        arm’s length dealings. Relations began to deteriorate with the arrest of
                        Pakistani private citizens and detention of embassy officials. Propaganda
                        directed against Pakistan by Kabul and Moscow has become increasingly
                        hostile. In retaliation, Pakistan has increased surveillance of Afghan
                        diplomats in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>—Anticipating the Afghan government will use Pakistan as a scapegoat for
                        recent disorders in Kabul, Islamabad has ordered the closure of Pakistan’s
                        Embassy in Kabul and Consulate in Kandahar.</p>
                    <p>—Severance of diplomatic relations, which is apparently the Pakistani
                        intention, would be consistent with last month’s Islamic Conference
                        resolution. It would also be prudent in light of the recent direction of
                        relations, and the increased prospect of Afghan harassment or reprisals
                        against Pakistani’s in Afghanistan. Conversely, such a break may confirm
                        Afghan suspicions that Pakistan’s intentions are hostile. Should relations
                        be severed, the danger of border clashes is likely to increase
                        substantially.</p>

                    <p>We should be careful in implying blank endorsement to the Muslim forces in
                        Afghanistan. First off, some of the groups are obscurantist at best; most of
                        them are quite literally reactionary. They have some noble aspects and
                        nobody who hates Russians can be all bad; nonetheless, they tend to be a
                        pretty ugly bunch. I shudder to think of the human rights problems we would
                        face if they came to power. Second, by emphasizing the Muslim aspect, we are
                        scaring the Indians—and perhaps the Soviets counterproductively.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> drew

                        there is no reason to assume that these people like us much more than they
                        do the Soviets. They are quite likely to take a <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> approach—or perhaps emulate the theology of the
                        fellow who tried to seize the Mecca mosque. Finally, we get more than
                        occasional reports that at least some of the insurgents inside the country
                        are very anti-American because they think we aren’t helping them. (S)</p>
                    <p>Obviously, there is nobody in Afghanistan to deal with except Muslims and we
                        certainly want to support their right to exercise their religion freely (as
                        long as I don’t have to be around while they are doing it!). We do not,
                        however, need to convey the idea that we want to see Afghanistan handed over

                    <p>1. (C—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary. Actions of the magnitude of the Afghan invasion may perhaps be
                        justified to the world at large in terms of Realpolitik or international
                        law. The Soviets are busily attempting that, with a steady <pb n="605" facs="0650" xml:id="pg_605"/>propaganda barrage aimed at proving
                        external aggression, duty-to-treaty obligations, and threats to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s own security. But for the Party
                        faithful, domestically and in the Communist Parties abroad, more important
                        is the need to understand how the invasion comports with Marxist-Leninist
                        ideology. Despite this obvious need, we find, however, that Soviet
                        leaders—perhaps because of Moscow’s awareness of the anxieties generated
                        abroad by the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine—have
                        so far made only a few stabs at rationalizing their action in ideological
                        terms. No general theory has yet been articulated. Prompted by <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, which suggests the existence of an
                        “Afghan corollary” to the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        Doctrine, we have reexamined the post-Afghanistan Soviet leadership
                        statements as well as current and earlier theoretical journals. Thus far,
                        the ideological linkage between the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine—which applies to “socialist states”—and
                        the Afghan invasion has not yet been made, though one prominent ideologist
                        does hint in a pre-invasion article at the need to act when the gains in
                        countries with a “socialist orientation”, such as Afghanistan, are in
                        jeopardy. If Washington analysts agree with our analysis of the ideologist’s
                        article, it may be worth flagging to interested scholars or the media for
                        their consideration and possible exploitation. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Since the invasion of Afghanistan, there has been speculation about the
                        emergence of a revised or extended <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine to explain the Soviet action (e.g., <gloss target="#t_USICA_1">USICA</gloss> 7395). The speculation is based on the
                        conclusion that the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        Doctrine, as imputed to the Soviets following the Czechoslovak invasion,
                        falls short of providing a plausible ideological explanation for the latest
                        Soviet invasion, and therefore one needs (leaving aside for the moment why
                        the “need” arises) a revised formulation of the original doctrine or an
                        “Afghan corollary” to it.</p>
                    <p>4. In what way does the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        Doctrine fall short of explaining, in Marxist-Leninist terms, the invasion
                        of Afghanistan? Following the August 1968 invasion, students of Soviet
                        ideology relied on various official statements—but especially one by
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> at the Fifth Congress
                        of the Polish United Workers Party on November 12, 1968—to make the case
                        that a new ideological doctrine had been fashioned. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> stated at the Congress that:</p>
                    <p>When internal and external forces, hostile to socialism, seek to reverse the
                        development of any socialist country whatsoever in the direction of the
                        restoration of the capitalist order, when a threat to the cause of socialism
                        arises in that country, a threat to the security of the socialist
                        commonwealth as a whole—this already becomes not only a problem of the
                        people of the country concerned, but also a common problem and the concern
                        of all socialist countries.</p>
                    <p>Because Czechoslovakia was a Warsaw Pact country, “any socialist country” as
                        used by <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> was mainly viewed

                        countries of Eastern Europe, including Yugoslavia, rather than those
                        elsewhere such as North Vietnam, North Korea, and Cuba.</p>
                    <p>5. The key point of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>
                        Doctrine in terms of its present-day [garble—relevance?] to Afghanistan is
                        the reference to “socialist country”. No Soviet official has ever argued
                        that Afghanistan has been a “socialist country” (or, for that matter, ever
                        experienced “a capitalist order”), or is presently calling on the “socialist
                        commonwealth”, as was done in the case of Czechoslovakia, to react to
                        Afghanistan. Before the April 1978 revolution which overthrew Daoud,
                        Afghanistan was seen as essentially feudal, and after the revolution as
                        embarking on the path of “socialist orientation”. Soviet ideologists make a
                        sharp distinction between “socialist countries” and those bearing the label
                        of “socialist orientation”: The Deputy Chief of the Central Committee’s
                        International Department, Ul’yanovskiy, writing in the authoritative <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss> theoretical journal <hi rend="italic">Kommunist</hi> last July, defined the latter group of countries as
                        “those, not yet being socialist, (but) which reject capitalism as a system,
                        carry out fundamental social changes facilitating and hastening their
                        possible transition to socialism.” Among the Third World countries assigned
                        by the Soviets to this category besides Afghanistan (which Ul’yanovskiy last
                        July noted had “recently joined them”) are Algeria, Benin, Burma, Guinea,
                            <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, Congo (Brazzaville), Syria,
                        Tanzania, Angola, Madagascar, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Jamaica. Candidate
                        Politburo member Demichev, in discussing the international situation in his
                        February 1 election speech, alluded to both kinds of Soviet allies, stating
                        that “the fraternal countries of socialism, (and) the developing countries
                        which have adopted a socialist orientation, are proceeding (forward)
                        shoulder to shoulder along with us.”</p>
                    <p>6. If Afghanistan does not fit neatly into the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine as it is usually understood, then is there
                        some doctrine-in-the-making in which it does fit, as some Western observers
                        are speculating? Are there statements by Soviet leaders or ideologists since
                        the Afghanistan invasion which put the Soviet action in a Marxist-Leninist
                        framework of more general applicability? Obviously, here arises a dilemma
                        for the Soviets. Domestically, and for Communist parties abroad, there
                        exists a need to provide some transcending ideological rationalization for
                        the Soviet action in Afghanistan, just as <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> felt compelled to provide some rationalization at
                        the PZPR Congress in November 1968 following the Czech invasion. Since the
                        entire Soviet system derives its legitimacy from Marxism-Leninism, the
                        millions of Party faithful who serve as props for that system have to be
                        served up some such interpretation of events such as Afghanistan. The danger
                        in the absence of such an interpretation is further ideological erosion.</p>
                    <p>7. At the same time, the very interpretation which the leadership provides
                        can only further heighten anxieties abroad, raising a dilemma. <pb n="607" facs="0652" xml:id="pg_607"/>Just as the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine reinforced skepticism about Soviet
                        intentions in “socialist countries” such as Romania and Yugoslavia, so will
                        any overarching interpretation for Soviet military aid in circumstances such
                        as Afghanistan raise concern among actual or potential countries assigned by
                        Moscow to the “socialist orientation” category, i.e., all countries of the
                        Third World as the Soviets see it. Although <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>, speaking in Belgrade in 1971, denied the existence
                        of any “so-called new doctrine of limited sovereignty,” the label “<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine” has continued to stick,
                        and do damage to the Soviet image abroad.</p>
                    <p>8. Perhaps in part because of the history of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine, Soviet leaders have so far played down
                        ideological explanations for their rendering aid to Afghanistan. The heavy
                        emphasis has rather been on meeting an Afghan request, in compliance with
                        treaty obligations, and on rights reaffirmed by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter, with occasional reference to the need to protect
                        Soviet state interests, by liquidating a situation which could have
                        resulted, in Moscow’s view, in hostile bases along the southern border.
                        Soviet leaders and ideologists have made a few random “stabs” at
                        rationalizing their action in terms of stock Marxist-Leninist formulas but
                        nothing approaching a general theory has yet been articulated. Among such
                        attempts, which have sometimes misled a few outside observers to conclude a
                        “new doctrine” is being offered, are:</p>
                    <p>—“Proletarian internationalism”: Two Central Committee apparatchiks (Kobysh
                        in <hi rend="italic">Literaturnaya Gazeta,</hi> January 23, and Portugalov
                        in <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>, February 6) first used the hoary
                        favorite, “proletarian internationalism”, in addressing the Afghan question.
                        However, with the exception of <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> Chief
                            <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName>, the Soviet leaders
                        themselves have avoided resort to this rationalization in the specific
                        context of military aid to Afghanistan. (<persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Andropov</persName> said that the Soviet aid was a “high act of
                        faithfulness to the principle of proletarian internationalism . . .”) We
                        assume <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> and others have
                        steered clear of “proletarian internationalism” for the reason that
                        Afghanistan obviously lacks a proletariat of any significance for which such
                        aid could be justified.</p>
                    <p>—“International duty” or “international solidarity”: Soviet leaders,

                        have generally settled for one of these hackneyed formulas to justify their
                        military assistance on Marxist-Leninist grounds. Both recur in the unsigned
                            <hi rend="italic">Novoye Vremya</hi> article which prompted David Binder
                        to speculate in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> that an “extended

                        Soviet source, is that it provides too sweeping language for any new
                        doctrine . . . a succession of slogans such as “international solidarity”
                        rather than workable criteria. Both of these slogans did appear in the

                        issued in Moscow January 10 which International Department head Ponomaryev
                        has strongly recommended to Party members for an understanding of
                            Afghanistan.<note n="4" xml:id="d222fn4">In telegram 1209 from Paris,
                            January 11, the Embassy reported on a statement made by French Communist
                            Party leader Georges Marchais, January 10. Marchais declared the Soviet
                            intervention in Afghanistan was justified in order to defeat the
                            “imperialist threat” Afghanistan faced. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                        the Soviet press immediately following the Czechoslovak invasion, beginning
                        with the August 22, 1968 unsigned statement in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>
                        entitled “The Highest International Duty.”</p>
                    <p>9. Although Soviet statements since the Afghanistan invasion therefore
                        provide little substance for a revised <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine, the fact that Afghanistan falls into a
                        common stage of development on the Marxist-Leninist road to Communism, along
                        which many other countries are depicted (by the Soviets) as traveling,
                        provides Western analysts with some basis to construct a revised doctrine.
                        It seems to us what is missing from Soviet statements since Afghanistan
                        which would lend itself to such an effort is a description of the
                        circumstances triggering a Soviet decision to render its “aid” to countries
                        of “socialist orientation”. The <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine, as cited in paragraph 4, describes the
                        “trigger” in the case of “socialist countries” as the emergence of “internal
                        and external forces, hostile to socialism, seek(ing) to reverse the
                        development of any socialist country . . .” But what circumstances are
                        germane in triggering Soviet assistance to a country of socialist
                        orientation?</p>
                    <p>10. The deputy head of the Central Committee’s International Department
                        Ul’yanovskiy, writing in the earlier cited <hi rend="italic">Kommunist</hi>
                        of last July, identifies circumstances which we believe could serve as the
                        basis for a doctrine of general applicability to this category of country.
                        Ul’yanovskiy states that a “socialist orientation” can be sustained “so long
                        as vigilance to imperialism’s schemes is maintained, so long as rebuffs are
                        given to insidious and dangerous neocolonialism.” “Any manifestation,”
                        Ul’yanovskiy continues, “of a lack of confidence, but even more, of
                        hostility to the world of socialism, any manifestation of a tendency to
                        conciliation in relation to imperialist policy, to neocolonialists—‘beware
                        of these latter day bearers of gifts’—usually serves as a signal of a
                        retreat from the principles of socialist orientation.”</p>
                    <p><pb n="609" facs="0654" xml:id="pg_609"/>11. Ul’yanovskiy’s statement does
                        not include an explicit warning of the consequences when a “signal” is
                        received by Moscow of a “retreat” from a “socialist orientation”. In terms
                        of the translation of theory into practice, the threshold triggering and
                        defining Soviet action obviously is seen to vary from case to case
                        (depending on geopolitical factors, international environment, etc.), even
                        for an ideologist such as Ul’yanovskiy; thus no Soviet “aid” at all was
                        rendered to Somalia although it is cited in the article as a country of
                        “socialist orientation” in retreat. (Besides, Soviet ideologists are not
                        supposed to issue warnings.) But the net result of Ul’yanovskiy’s
                        description of what comprises a “retreat”, when considered in light of the
                        action the Soviets took against the <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government, is to suggest a doctrine akin to the
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine—but addressed
                        to this category of countries rather than “socialist countries”. For the
                        countries of the Third World, assigned now or in the future by Moscow’s
                        ideologists to the “socialist orientation” category, Ul’yanovskiy’s language
                        adds up to a fairly credible warning—and made more credible as Moscow’s
                        capability to project force into the Third World improves.</p>
                    <p>12. While our purpose has been to focus above on an ideological justification
                        for Soviet intervention in Third World countries, the fact is that—as
                        mentioned previously—in the case of Afghanistan the Soviets have thus far
                        emphasized primarily “legal-political” justifications, especially the 1978
                        Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. It may well be that the Soviets in
                        fact will only feel comfortable engaging in a significant military
                        intervention in a sovereign state in circumstances providing both an
                        ideological explanation for domestic consumption within socialist countries,
                        and a “legal-political” justification for the world at large. This would
                        follow the Czechoslovak pattern where the Soviets had their
                        “legal-political” pretext, given Czechoslovak membership in the Warsaw Pact,
                        and developed their ideological justification in the form of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine only after the fact of
                        the invasion. In any event, the ideological justifications discussed in the
                        preceding paragraphs in no way contradict Soviet “legal-political”
                        explanations for the Afghan invasion, but are rather hypothesized as a
                        complement to them. All factors considered, there is the suggestion that the
                        states most endangered by the precedent of Afghanistan are those countries
                        which are both “of socialist orientation” and have in addition
                        legal-political ties to Moscow such as treaties of friendship and
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>13. We suggest the above as one possible approach to identifying a <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>-type doctrine in the thicket of
                        the largely non-ideological Soviet statements so far issued in justification
                        of the Afghanistan invasion. Given Moscow’s awareness of anxieties in the
                        Third World following its action, it may be some time before a comprehensive
                        statement lending itself to the development of a new doctrine actually <pb n="610" facs="0655" xml:id="pg_610"/>surfaces here. It may be worth
                        Washington’s effort, therefore, in terms of our public diplomacy in the
                        Third World in the next years, to flag the approach to interested scholars
                        or the media for their consideration and possible exploitation.</p>

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Doctrine adds the general
                        area of the Persian Gulf (which I strongly recommend we henceforth refer to
                        as the “Gulf”) to Western Europe, Japan and the Eastern Mediterranean as
                        among the vital interests to the United States. Unlike the other areas, the
                        Gulf is unique in having been defined by <hi rend="italic">both</hi>
                        superpowers as of vital interest (see the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement of
                            1940).<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">See <ref target="#d243">Document
                                243</ref>.</note> This makes it essential to elaborate new ground
                        rules for superpower relations to replace those agreed to at the 1972 Moscow
                        summit prohibiting advantage-seeking in peripheral areas, flagrantly
                        violated by the Soviet Union in Angola, Ethiopia, and South Yemen. (U)</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan is of course more than that. It is a case of armed intervention,
                        but in an area of vital interest to Moscow. (The closest <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> analogy is the Dominican Republic in
                            1965.)<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">See <ref target="#d178">Document

                            thereto.</note> But it is also a third world, “unaligned” country. Any
                        viable ground rules applicable to Afghanistan should respond both to Soviet
                        perceptions of interests, and to third world allergy to superpower military
                        intervention. (C)</p>
                    <p>The essence of such a rule would be a prohibition not just of
                        advantage-seeking but of <hi rend="italic">outside armed military
                            interference</hi> in third world conflicts or in the internal affairs of
                        unaligned countries. Such <pb n="611" facs="0656" xml:id="pg_611"/>a
                        doctrine would have been explicitly violated by Cuban troops in Africa or
                        Soviet troops in Afghanistan. (It also would have barred our intervention in
                        the DR in 1965, France in Zaire and Morocco, etc.) (C)</p>
                    <p>Such a doctrine would leave untouched the established military dispositions
                        of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe and the United States in Western
                        Europe and the Pacific, and would leave both free to deploy their fleets.

                    <p>“Guaranteed neutrality” for Afghanistan in exchange for complete withdrawal
                        of Soviet combat forces would serve <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        interests, but seems a non-starter as it offers nothing to Moscow except
                        face-saving. But its potential value to the larger need for
                        universally-applicable ground-rules requires that it be seriously analyzed.
                        Two things are required: a greater inducement to Moscow to accede; and some
                        imaginative instrumentalities, such as international observation, to make
                        the guarantee effective. (C)</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan will undoubtedly revert to its historic xenophobic stance, which
                        leads Americans to predict Soviet non-acceptance. But the matter acquires
                        more substance when seen in a larger perspective, particularly in terms of
                        Cuba. Afghanistan and Cuba are symmetrical in unique ways. (C)</p>
                    <p>A guarantee of neutrality was in effect given in 1962 when Moscow agreed not
                        to make it a base for offensive weapons, in exchange for which we agreed not
                        to invade Cuba. (U)</p>
                    <p>A comparable agreement should be considered for Afghanistan. In both cases
                        the internal political orientation will probably remain anathema to the
                        neighboring superpower. But a variety of tolerable coexistence becomes
                        possible by virtue of neutralization, meaning: a) <hi rend="italic">verified
                            guarantees against pursuit of policies threatening to the neighbor</hi>;
                        and b) <hi rend="italic">absence of superpower military intervention</hi>
                        (including China). (C)</p>
                    <p>In linking Cuba and Afghanistan, we do not want to generate a new crisis. The
                        point is that President Kennedy’s 1962 agreement could be the obvious model
                        for Afghanistan. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> self-imposed restraint
                        after such an agreement becomes the implicit model for Soviet policy in
                        withdrawing from Afghanistan. (C)</p>
                    <p>(An even broader global perspective is afforded by Palestinian autonomy. A
                        well-developed and implemented doctrine prohibiting armed intervention will
                        undoubtedly have to be an element in the essential neutralization of any
                        Palestinian homeland. The latter case would be characteristic of the
                        settlements which brought long-term peace to Belgium, Switzerland, and
                        Austria. The new rule would be very relevant.) (C)</p>
                    <p>A final element is an enhanced role for international peace observation. The
                        habitual dismissal of this capability until it is desperately <pb n="612" facs="0657" xml:id="pg_612"/>needed in crisis should be eschewed, and it
                        should be made part of serious planning. (C)</p>

                    <p>The Pakistanis appear convinced that accepting the proposed aid package would

                        <item>Soviet Motives in Afghanistan</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In choosing to intervene in Afghanistan, the Soviets were primarily motivated
                        by their own security concerns. In their pre-decision deliberations, they
                        apparently underestimated both the strength of the insurgency and the
                        intensity of the international reaction. Despite their miscalculations,
                        however, we believe the Soviets are not now prepared to alter their course.
                        Present efforts seem primarily aimed at stabilizing the situation in
                        Afghanistan, exploiting differences among the western allies, and limiting
                        the damage which Afghanistan has done to overall US-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>By late 1979, Moscow was faced with a dire situation in Afghanistan. If it
                        did not act, the best it could hope for was prolonged fighting, further
                        regime coups, and political chaos; the worst, the establishment of an
                        anti-Soviet regime that would develop ties with Iran, Pakistan, the US, and
                        China. From the Soviet perspective, such a turn of events would have
                        overturned a long tradition of Afghan dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and would have meant an unacceptable
                        situation on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s southern border.
                        Tolerance of such an outcome would have called into question Moscow’s
                        willingness to back its clients elsewhere in the Third World. By early
                        December, the Soviet leadership concluded that the only solution to the
                        problem was military intervention, and that while such action would carry
                        considerable political costs, the benefits of a stable and secure
                        Afghanistan firmly in the Soviet camp were worth the price.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Miscalculation</p>
                    <p>In its deliberations, Moscow miscalculated. In terms of the military
                        situation, the Soviets seem to have misjudged the strength and capabilities
                        of the insurgents. While the Soviets probably calculated that their own
                        troops would have to secure the major urban areas and lines of communication
                        in Afghanistan until the Afghan army could be reorganized and equipped to
                        fight the insurgency, it probably underes<pb n="614" facs="0659" xml:id="pg_614"/>timated the time and manpower that would be needed even
                        for this limited objective. Originally, Moscow may have hoped that 40,000 to
                        60,000 Soviet troops would be enough; present force configurations would
                        seem to indicate that the Soviets now believe that it will need at least
                        double that number, and that the Soviet, rather than the Afghan, army will
                        have to bear the brunt of the fighting for the present.</p>
                    <p>Moscow apparently also miscalculated the intensity of the international
                        reaction to its intervention in Afghanistan. In terms of US-Soviet
                        relations, Moscow was probably ready to accept a bad press and the delay of
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II ratification. However, the
                        Soviets may not have anticipated the American actions either to curtail
                        shipments of feed grains and export of high technology or to boycott the
                        Olympics. Indeed, clandestine reporting indicates that the Soviets may have
                        believed that the US was too distracted by the situation in Iran to develop
                        a strong response.</p>
                    <p>The Kremlin also seems to have been taken aback by the strength of the West
                        European response. While it no doubt expected them to denounce Soviet
                        actions, Moscow may not have expected the West Europeans to give the US as
                        much support as they have. Moscow was probably equally surprised by the
                        nearly unanimous hostile Islamic reaction evoked at the Islamabad Conference
                        in January.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">In Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>Resistance in Afghanistan has evidently been stronger than Moscow originally
                        anticipated. The Babrak government has not been more effective than
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s, and the internal
                        situation has deteriorated since the intervention.</p>
                    <p>Despite the international reaction and the resistance in Afghanistan, the
                        Soviets are adding men and equipment to their forces, building permanent
                        barracks and are apparently planning for large operations against the
                        rebels. The Soviets have yet to engage in major operations against the
                        rebels, and seem unlikely to conclude that their intervention will not
                        succeed in its limited military objectives of stalemating the insurgency
                        before a spring offensive is tried.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Diplomatic Posture</p>
                    <p>Although the Soviet media and leadership have been quick to pick up on the
                        theme of Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan voiced in the West, there has
                        been little or no deviation from their original position of December 27.
                        Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> in his speech of
                        February 22, seemed to add to earlier demands on the question of withdrawal
                        when he said that the Soviets will only withdraw when the US and
                        Afghanistan’s neighbors are willing to “guarantee” that all outside
                        interference in <pb n="615" facs="0660" xml:id="pg_615"/>Afghanistan has

                                216</ref>.</note> On the face of it, <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s statement was probably not intended as a signal
                        of Soviet interest in negotiation on the issue. However, Moscow may have
                        been impressed by the subsequent Western reaction to even such a slight
                        shift in the Soviet position and is now attempting to play on this interest
                        to imply reasonableness in the Kremlin.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the Soviets have given little public play to the West European
                        proposal for the “neutralization” of Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">The Foreign Ministers of the nine European Community

                            affairs, “we can come to a settlement,” provided that, subsequently,
                            Afghanistan’s military capabilities would be limited to defensive needs.

                        the Soviets are trying to dangle the prospect of a political solution to the
                        Afghan situation in order, in the short run, to divide western opinion and
                        policy, and, in the longer run, to keep open the possibility of a negotiated
                        agreement that in effect would place a world seal of approval on the Soviet
                        intervention and the resulting permanent satellization of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the Soviets are intent upon limiting the damage Afghanistan
                        has wreaked on its relations with the West and the Third World. Moscow has
                        repeatedly stressed that detente remains its basic policy line. Similarly,
                        one Soviet article has tried to allay West European fears of an increased
                        Soviet threat to the oil rich Persian Gulf by resurrecting its 1976 proposal
                        that the security of the area be internationally guaranteed.<note n="5" xml:id="d225fn5">Not further identified.</note> Moscow has also
                        attempted to deflect Arab displeasure by hammering away at the betrayal of
                        the Palestinian cause allegedly <pb n="616" facs="0661" xml:id="pg_616"/>inherent in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and longer term at the
                        continuing threat which the US poses for the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>In the longer term, Moscow probably believes that it can eventually stabilize
                        the situation in Afghanistan, and that, as it does, international pressure
                        will decrease, much as it did in 1968 with Czechoslovakia. The Soviets
                        probably have concluded that continued tensions in the Mideast will
                        eventually allow them to recoup their losses, largely because the radical
                        Arabs have few other options in terms of sophisticated arms and great power
                        support. Moscow also probably believes that the very fact that it has
                        secured its position in Afghanistan will enable it to exert more influence
                        on Iran and Pakistan, and in time to undercut US and Chinese influence. To
                        this end, the Soviets probably will try to refrain from overly antagonizing
                        any of the parties involved. As their involvement in the counterinsurgency
                        in Afghanistan grows, however, this moderate position will become
                        increasingly difficult to maintain both as a result of fighting the war
                        itself (which may inevitably come to involve Pakistan’s border areas), and
                        as a result of having to justify that war to a worried home front.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. In reviewing the Chief of Station Kabul’s latest assessment on the
                        insurgency in Afghanistan and its prospects for the next six months, we
                        found that we totally agreed with some of the conclusions made by the <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss> but disagreed with others.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">The referenced assessment was not found.</note></p>
                    <p>2. Analysts on the Afghan Task Force have long believed that the insurgents
                        were too weak to topple the government by defeating the Afghan Army in
                        military action. The insurgents can harass and pressure <pb n="617" facs="0662" xml:id="pg_617"/>Afghan Army units in the field but do not
                        have the leadership, training, experience, or firepower to engage the Afghan
                        Army in set-piece battles. The danger has always been the potential for
                        unraveling from within, and it was that danger that brought the Soviets into
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets have thus far not enjoyed any meaningful successes against the
                        insurgents, but that is likely to change now that the weather is improving
                        and the Soviets can use their firepower more effectively. The Soviets have
                        begun a major new offensive in eastern Afghanistan and the preliminary
                        evidence suggests they are successfully pushing the insurgents back in
                        several provinces. This is not unexpected. We knew the rebels would avoid
                        set-piece battles with the stronger Soviet forces and that appears to be
                        what they are doing. We believe the insurgents will retreat rather than
                        fight pitched battles. They will move deeper into sanctuaries inside
                        Afghanistan and across the border into Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviets are likely to further intensify their attacks on insurgent
                        bases over the spring and summer months. This will result in their
                        consolidating their control along key roads and around major cities and in
                        pushing the insurgents back. But, it is questionable if these will be
                        lasting successes. We believe the insurgents will avoid the Soviets when
                        they hold the edge but will reoccupy territory as the Soviets withdraw. In
                        short, the insurgents will fight when they have the advantage and not when
                        the other side holds the edge. We doubt that the Soviets can completely
                        secure the roads and the countryside in six months.</p>

                        Province and stated that it might parallel insurgency in other
                            provinces.<note n="4" xml:id="d227fn4">Attachment C, not printed, is
                            telegram 690 from Kabul, which reported claims made by insurgents in
                            Wardak, a province west of Kabul, that they were preparing a Spring
                            offensive, and that these plans might be part of a broader plan for
                            increased rebel attacks in other provinces. The Embassy concluded that
                            the information was accurate.</note> Paragraphs 5–8 concern the
                        smuggling of arms from Peshawar to Wardak. Paragraph 9 states: “A caravan
                        reaching Wardak on about January 25 reportedly brought twelve
                        ‘shoulder-fired anti-tank guns,’ ninety ‘long-range’ rifles, one ‘dah shoba’
                        (phonetic—10 branches?) anti-aircraft weapon, and three ‘multi-purpose’
                        weapons usable against aircraft or tanks. The rifles were allegedly
                        ‘American made.’ The other arms were of Chinese origin, one source’s
                        informants say. A 120-man caravan is expected to reach Wardak from Peshawar
                        on about March 5 . . . with more weapons. (Comment: The information about

                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Chemical Warfare</hi>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> said there is growing evidence that
                        the Soviets have used chemical warfare in Afghanistan, but as yet it is not
                        possible to confirm adequately that this has gone beyond the use of riot
                        control agents.<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">This allegation was first
                            reported in a situation report prepared in the Central Intelligence
                            Agency, March 1, based on “credible evidence” received in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Consulate in Peshawar: “Three separate
                            reports from Afghan refugees who claim to have witnessed the attacks
                            gave similar descriptions of gas canisters, symptoms of Afghan victims,
                            and methods used to avoid contamination. The attacks are said to have
                            occurred in Badakhshan, Vardak, and Takhar Provinces both before and
                            after the Soviet invasion. The victims apparently experienced loss of
                            control, became unconscious, or died. We have received a number of other
                            reports of chemical warfare in Afghanistan, mainly from refugees, but
                            these have been inconclusive and of questionable reliability.” ([<hi rend="italic">report number not declassified</hi>] March 1; Central

                        believe that is part of their normal equipment. General <persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> would like to send a team of experts to Pakistan to debrief
                        refugees who have experienced or witnessed the use of chemical agents.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> said the Pakistanis
                        will not permit direct contact of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        personnel with the refugees in order to prevent refugees from being tortured
                        and stating that such direct contacts had occurred while they were in
                        Pakistan. However, indirect contacts were possible. It was agreed that
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> would cooperate on a high priority basis to accumulate the

                            <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> next week. We do not want to make
                        any charges which could be disproved and thereby cast doubt on the
                        credibility of future evidence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> noted that we also have a large body of evidence
                        of use of chemical agents in Southeast Asia, although the Afghanistan
                        situation is the first directly relating the Soviets to use of these
                            agents.<note n="3" xml:id="d228fn3">A reference to allegations that the
                            Soviet Union was supplying Vietnam with chemical weapons for use in its

                    <p>—Sustained Islam outrage at Soviet actions in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>—Sustained and improved Western solidarity on the issue. (S)</p>
                    <p>He indicated that he agreed with the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>’s
                        preference for Option 2 (make clear to others the parameters for
                        neutralization which would be acceptable to the United States and seek to
                        shape any proposals before they are launched). He also noted agreement with
                            <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> skepticism about Soviet willingness
                        to negotiate seriously and concern that the uncoordinated Western approach
                        is weakening both our solidarity and prospects for a longer run
                            settlement.<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">For the issue of possible Soviet
                            willingness to negotiate on withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan,
                            thereby leading to the eventual neutralization of that country, see <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s skepticism squared with the dominant view of
                            the intelligence community. For example, an interagency intelligence
                            memorandum, March 13, concluded regarding Soviet intentions in
                            Afghanistan: “The Soviets will continue for tactical reasons to suggest
                            a certain receptivity to proposals for troop withdrawals. In the next
                            two to three months, however, they will probably continue their buildup
                            to a total force of at least eight division equivalents. Following this
                            spring’s counterinsurgency offensive, they are likely to conclude that
                            even more forces are needed. Regardless of their success against the
                            insurgents, the Soviets intend to maintain a significant military
                            presence in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future to reinforce their
                            broader regional influence.” (Central Intelligence Agency, History Staff

                        With <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> on Afghanistan and
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet Relations.</p>
                    <p>1. (S—Entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: I had a lengthy discussion yesterday with USA Institute Director
                            <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>, who provided no fresh
                        insights into how the Afghan problem might be solved other than to stress
                        that the Soviets would never accept an outcome which made it appear that
                        they were being “punished.” He said the Soviets were convinced that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had been providing significant
                        support to the Afghan insurgents, but he also described the excesses of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime as one reason for the
                        Soviet action. He thought stability could be brought about within a few
                        months if outside interference stopped.</p>
                    <p>In blaming the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for the deterioration in
                        Soviet/American relations, <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>
                        said that after almost all the other aspects of the détente relationship had
                        been dismantled <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II was left in an
                        exposed position and therefore was also vulnerable. He was not optimistic
                        that a relationship could be rebuilt on arms control alone, though he agreed
                        on the urgency of getting the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process
                        started again. While he had no specific suggestions on how this might be
                        done, he mentioned the possibility of a <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        meeting in Vienna as a desirable beginning. End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> came to lunch at Spaso
                        House March 10 with his associate Mr. Zhurkin. The Acting <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> and I represented the American side. Lunch
                        started on an exchange of pleasantries. I had met Zhurkin at an Airlie House
                        conference which I attended with <persName corresp="#p_SMD_1">Marshall
                            Shulman</persName>, so the atmosphere was easy and relaxed. Shortly
                        after sitting down at the table, we began to get into matters of substance.
                        I mentioned that we were trying to find means of changing the present very
                        low level of Soviet-American relations and getting the relationship back on
                        track, moving ahead, and improving again. <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> expressed the same general sentiments and indicated
                        his clear understanding that if we stayed in the present mode very long, an
                        uncontrolled arms race in the future would be impossible to avoid. He said
                        he thought our relations could not remain even in their present very bad
                        state for long. <pb n="624" facs="0669" xml:id="pg_624"/>If they did not
                        improve soon, they would get much worse. And “many people here in town” he
                        said, are beginning to have doubts about the prospects.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>5. On Afghanistan, I made very strongly the argument that the Soviet press
                        was blaming the whole problem upon the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        upsetting the internal situation in Afghanistan and that we had specifically
                        stated that we had not been interfering and had done so many times, most
                        recently in President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        letter to <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName>, from which I
                            quoted.<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s February 26 letter to <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName> addressed how the Soviet invasion
                            of Afghanistan had changed the dynamic of détente and offered support to
                            Yugoslavia as an independent and nonaligned country. (Carter Library,
                            National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, President’s

                            6/79–2/80)</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>’s answer to this was, “I am
                        not disputing your word, but perhaps the Agency has been misinforming the
                        State Department.” He said his government was convinced that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is in fact training and sending in Afghans
                        from Pakistan to disrupt the internal situation. He said that about three
                        million Afghanis moved back and forth between Pakistan and Afghanistan
                        seasonally with their flocks and that the infiltration of 200,000 armed
                        Afghans would be relatively simple to be hidden in this migration—though he
                        added that he had no information that this was actually happening.</p>
                    <p>6. While he stressed the role of outside interference, by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and also by China and Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> discussed the internal situation in
                        Afghanistan as well as a reason for the Soviet action. He said the Soviets
                        had gotten along very well with the King and with Daoud and then talked
                        about the excesses of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, whom he
                        compared with his namesake Idi Amin. He said that the elimination of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime, while in the Soviet
                        interest, was also somewhat in the American interest because they were
                        attempting to remove a bloody tyrant, installing a more generally popular
                        regime, and bringing stability to the region.</p>
                    <p>7. As for how long it might take to bring about the stability they were
                        seeking, <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> thought maybe only a
                        few months—provided outside interference stopped. He did not dispute my
                        point that the <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> formula
                        seemed like a non-starter, since it was impossible for us to pledge to stop
                        doing something we are not doing. He did not seem much interested in talking
                        about other formulas for getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan, although he
                        thought the idea of having Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName> and a group of nonaligned nations or others work
                        together to find some way to guarantee the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>/Afghan border was an idea worth exploring.</p>
                    <p><pb n="625" facs="0670" xml:id="pg_625"/>8. The main point he made repeatedly
                        with regard to an Afghan settlement was that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> seemed intent on “punishing” the Soviet Union and that
                        they would not under any circumstances accept a solution that made them look
                        punished. He said that when the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was
                        willing to cease making Afghanistan a pure propaganda issue the matter could
                        be treated seriously.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>12. All in all, the luncheon which took over two hours was a quiet,
                        unemotional exchange of views with each side claiming to understand the
                        other but with no constructive suggestion on the part of <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName> or Zhurkin toward a solution to
                        break the impasse. The two points that came through most clearly were that
                        the Soviets will not abide by an indication that they are being punished,
                        and two, that a <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> meeting might be desirable as a
                        departure point for a new relationship.</p>
                    <p>13. However, since there is no movement in the Soviet position here, I am not
                        hopeful that we as yet have any signal of a direction for sensible movement
                        in the future.</p>

                    <p>We believe the evidence is sufficient to conclude that Soviet forces have
                        used nonlethal chemicals against insurgents in a number of areas of
                        Afghanistan. The chemicals employed almost certainly have included irritants
                        such as riot-control agents, probably mixed with smoke. Continuing
                        allegations of deaths resulting from chemical attacks lead us to conclude
                        that the chances are about even that lethal agents, such as nerve gas, also
                        have been used.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">The Soviet Union signed and
                            ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the first use of chemical

                            signatories. Because Afghanistan is not a signatory, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would not be in violation of the

                    <p>The Soviets have deployed chemical defense battalions with the three
                        motorized rifle divisions in Afghanistan, and Soviet troops in the Kabul

                        suggesting that Soviet forces in the country are prepared to operate in
                        terrain contaminated by chemical agents. These units and the chemical
                        defense equipment seen in Afghanistan, however, are standard in all Soviet

                        the five Afghan political groups which joined together in early February
                        1980 to form the United Islamic Liberation Front of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss>) received 1,000,000 Pakistani rupees
                        (approximately <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> $100,000) from the Saudi
                        Arabian Government when the <gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss> was
                        formed. <gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss> has been promised
                        $6,000,000 more by the Saudis. (Headquarters comment: See State telegram
                        035357, 9 February, for background on the formation of <gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss>.)<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">In

                            after more than a year and a half of fruitless efforts to bring unity to

                            however, the <gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss> was “still a very
                            fragile organization” whose leaders remained “separated by important
                            ideological as well as personal differences.” These differences included
                            varying attitudes toward both the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the form of government
                            Afghanistan should adopt, ranging from a Western-style democracy to a
                            fundamentalist Islamic orientation. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                    <p>2. Many leaders of Afghan tribal paramilitary forces fighting in Afghanistan
                        are aware of the sums received by the <gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss> groups in Peshawar, and some believe the sums are greater
                        than they really are. The <gloss target="#t_UILFA_1">UILFA</gloss>’s failure
                        so far to spend any of the Saudi money in support of the groups fighting
                        inside Afghanistan is creating a credibility gap between the people of
                        Afghanistan and the exiled political leaders greater than has previously
                        existed. This credibility gap has been enhanced by the paramilitary leaders’
                        observations that some of the political leaders in exile are prospering by
                        conducting various forms of trade.</p>

                    <p>1. The Soviet reaction to the initiation of attacks against their aircraft in
                        Afghanistan by SA–7s will depend on (1) their estimate of the level of
                        military threat that they could anticipate from such attacks (if not
                        terminated); (2) their estimate of the likelihood that the threat could be
                        eliminated (or managed) by in-country military measures; (3) their estimate
                        of the efficacy of threats or retaliatory military actions against Pakistan
                        for terminating the activity; (4) their estimate of the consequences that
                        such retaliatory actions against Pakistan might produce for US/Pakistan
                        relations (e.g. driving Pakistan closer to US). [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>2. We assume that the availability of portable surface-to-air weapons to
                        insurgent forces in Afghanistan will make itself known to the Soviets
                        initially by random and intermittent attacks against its aircraft. We also
                        assume that the Soviets will believe, or will proceed on the assumption
                        that, those weapons were being fed into Afghanistan through Pakistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">An article in the President’s Daily Brief, March
                            28, reported: “Soviet SA–7 antiaircraft missiles have reportedly fallen

                        assumption even in the absence of hard evidence unless they believe they
                        have hard evidence to the contrary (e.g. that the weapons were being

                    <p>3. A crucial consideration governing the initial Soviet response will be
                        their estimate of the scope of the new threat posed to them. If they <pb n="630" facs="0675" xml:id="pg_630"/>become persuaded that they are
                        faced with what would at most amount to no more than a low-level nuisance
                        threat capable of bringing down an occasional Soviet aircraft, or
                        embarrassing the Soviets and marginally encouraging the insurgents, but not
                        capable of materially affecting the course and outcome of the
                        counterinsurgency campaign, they might be prepared to confine themselves to
                        harsh threats and minor, or even ambiguous, retaliatory actions against
                        Pakistan designed primarily to discourage an enlargement of the activity in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <quote><p>a. A possible scenario in these circumstances might take the form of a
                            sharp warning directed to the Paks after several incidents involving the
                            firing of SA–7s in Afghanistan with a clear implication that if the
                            activities were not quickly terminated, unspecified but unpleasant
                            consequences would follow. The Soviets then might wait for a period of
                            time (up to several weeks) to observe the effect of their warning on the
                            level of activity on the assumption that the Pakistan government—even if
                            sufficiently frightened—would probably not be able to control the use of
                            rockets already in Afghanistan, but that it could take measures to
                            prevent the introduction of additional weapons or missiles
                            thereafter.</p>
                        <p>b. Should the scope and intensity of the use of these weapons against
                            Soviet forces proceed at the same or similar levels beyond the
                            stipulated time, the Soviets would probably take retaliatory actions
                            against Pakistan, e.g. starting low and gradually escalating from more
                            to less ambiguous forms, employing either Afghan ground forces or Soviet
                            aircraft with Afghan markings. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking

                    <p>4. Should the Soviets either conclude at the outset that they faced a
                        substantial military threat from the rockets, or that the low level of
                        attacks they initially faced was bound to be raised by the introduction of
                        substantial numbers of weapons <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> the Paks
                        reversed course, we would not be surprised to see the Soviets deliver a

                        retaliatory attacks against a variety of targets that could directly or
                        indirectly be said to associate Pakistan and the Afghan insurgents (refugee
                        camps, real or alleged training sites, military supply depots). If this did
                        not suffice, the Soviets could step up the pressure by attacking Pakistan
                        army encampments or airfields for the purpose of severely embarrassing if
                        not destabilizing the <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> government,

                    <quote><p>a. The Soviets would prefer to threaten or coerce Pakistan into
                            terminating the activity rather than engage in high-level retaliatory
                            action against Pakistan because Moscow would not wish unnecessarily to
                            accept the risk that the Paks would reconsider the desirability of a
                            closer security relationship with the US.</p>
                        <p><pb n="631" facs="0676" xml:id="pg_631"/>b. The Soviets might even prefer
                            to accept the low-level nuisance value of a fairly prolonged series of
                            attacks to the risk of a high-level military attack on Pakistan with the
                            attendant risk of driving the Paks back into the arms of the
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>c. However, if the Soviets were persuaded that the intensity of the
                            supply activity from Pakistan could not be controlled by means short of
                            severe retaliatory military actions, we believe they would, in the end,
                            take such military actions and would prefer in that case to pose such a
                            severe threat to the Paks so as to drive them to make demands for
                            security guarantees and assistance from the US so far-reaching that the
                            US would be unlikely to comply. [<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>The conversation started with <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        expressing considerable pessimism about the longer range trends in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations. He feels that we are on
                        a spiral—that both sides are becoming increasingly <pb n="632" facs="0677" xml:id="pg_632"/>antagonistic, and that he does not see much prospect
                        for an early improvement.</p>
                    <p>I suspect that this was a deliberate line designed to “smoke me out.” I made
                        the point in response that he may well be right but that what happens this
                        year in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations is likely to
                        influence a great deal the next four years. This is why we both have an
                        obligation to see if something could not be done in the near future to
                        reverse the negative trends set in motion by the Soviet action in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Substance</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned more specifically to the question of Afghanistan.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> spoke at some length,
                        reviewing recent history. He said that the Soviets had no intention of
                        moving into Afghanistan but the deteriorating situation gave them no choice.
                        (Incidentally, he told me that Babrak returned secretly to Kabul in October
                        of last year.)</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have no intention of dominating the region according to him and
                        will withdraw once a “stable government” has been created. He put a lot of
                        emphasis on organizing a new Afghanistan army which will carry on once the
                        Soviets have left. In response to a question, he indicated that it may be up
                        to a year or so before the Soviets can leave, but he professed great
                        optimism about their capacity to crush the resistance.</p>
                    <p>He said that the Soviet Union would be willing to give guarantees to us that
                        it has no designs against Pakistan and Iran.</p>
                    <p>I responded by saying that the key issue is whether the Soviet Union insists
                        on imposing a Communist government on Afghanistan or whether it desires an
                        Afghanistan that is genuinely non-aligned and non-hostile to the Soviet
                        Union. If it is the former, conflicts between us will persist because it
                        will require the Soviet army to maintain such a regime. But if it is the
                        latter, I am sure that we could work out international arrangements,
                        including transitionally some neutral forces from Moslem countries to assure
                        Afghanistan’s genuine neutrality. Communists could participate in such a
                        government, even if they could not dominate it. (I cited Finland as an
                        example.) In effect, the Soviets have to decide whether their objective is
                        to make Afghanistan into a Mongolia or whether they can live with an Asian
                        variant of Finland. In the latter case, there could be a relatively quick
                        upswing in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> responded by saying that the
                        above is a “harder” statement than made to Moscow by “some of your allies.”
                        He gave me the impression that my position on this is also harder than he
                        thought the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position actually was. He
                        maintained that his impression was that we would be satisfied with Soviet
                        “guarantees” for the region and with Soviet departure after Afghanistan has
                        become “stable.” Our allies are <pb n="633" facs="0678" xml:id="pg_633"/>more interested in the region than in Afghanistan and the Soviets can
                        assure us about the region.</p>
                    <p>I responded that the President in his letter to <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName> made it clear that we saw neutralization and departure
                        of the Soviet troops as linked, though we are not insisting that the latter
                        is sequentially a precondition for the former.<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">See <ref target="#d230fn2">foonote 2, Document 230</ref>.</note> I drew
                        his attention to the sentence in the letter which said that we would be
                        prepared to enter into guarantees “with the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet
                        troops” and I emphasized that the word “with” implied simultaneity.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say that the issue is not assurances but arrangements that can
                        endure. If the Soviets insist on a Communist government in Kabul, the Soviet
                        army will have to stay in Afghanistan for a long time and this has objective
                        consequences not only for relations with us but for stability in the
                        region.</p>
                    <p>At this point, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> seemed to hint
                        that it is not to be excluded that there could be some change in the Afghani
                        government and Babrak could become non-essential—though he immediately
                        qualified this by saying that he is not in a position to negotiate on this
                        subject with me.</p>
                    <p>I responded by saying that the creation of a genuine Afghani government need
                        not be the point of departure for a solution because it is not our intention
                        to humilitate the Soviet Union, but we do have to agree in advance on where
                        we will end up (i.e. a genuinely neutral and independent Afghanistan) and
                        then we can work on the steps of getting there. (I have to add that the hint
                        about Babrak’s dispensability was quite vague and I am not certain whether
                        it did indicate some flexibility on the Soviet part.)</p>

                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>. The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> reviewed a State Department paper outlining seven elements
                        of a possible policy directed at achieving the neutralization of Afghanistan
                            (attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Attached but not printed. The
                            paper listed seven possible elements to achieve the political
                            neutralization of Afghanistan: “1) Withdrawal of all Soviet military
                            forces from Afghanistan; 2) An Afghan government acceptable to the
                            Afghan people; 3) No interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan
                            by its neighbors or any other state; 4) Non-alignment in Afghanistan’s
                            foreign policy and permanent neutrality for Afghanistan, including the
                            obligation to refrain from entering into any military alliance, and to
                            refrain from allowing any state to have military forces or facilities in
                            its territory except by agreement of the guarantors; 5) Guarantees by
                            Afghanistan’s neighbors and other interested states of permanent
                            neutrality for Afghanistan and of non-interference in its internal
                            affairs; 6) Agreement by the Afghan government and all guarantors on the
                            definition of Afghanistan’s borders; 7) Arrangements apply only to
                            Afghanistan and not to affect the sovereign rights of other countries.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> made three notations
                            on the paper. He inserted “prompt” before “withdrawal” in the first
                            item; he bracketed items 6 and 7 and wrote: “I see no reason to include
                            these,” in the right margin; and at the bottom of the page, he wrote:
                            “Presumption must be that Soviets will not withdraw under any
                            circumstances, therefore, how to keep allies with us &amp; win
                            propaganda points.” These notations were also conveyed in a memorandum
                            from <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, March 19. (Department of State,

                        arrangements on how stability would be maintained in Afghanistan during the
                        turnover period if the Soviets should in fact agree to withdraw; and (2)
                        Graduated steps spelling out how we get from here to there, i.e., how would
                        we present this to the allies and to the Soviets, and how would we avoid
                        getting involved in a negotiating situation on issues we would prefer to
                        avoid. (S)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that when he had
                        presented some ideas along this line to <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        had remarked several times that that was not what they were hearing from
                        America’s allies.<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">See <ref target="#d235">Document 235</ref>.</note> Who was taking a different view? Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> suggested that the
                        original German paper, which had focused on possible concessions to the
                        Soviets to get out of Afghanistan, may have been the source of these
                            reports.<note n="4" xml:id="d236fn4">Not found.</note> The French,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> noted, had
                        contributed to that paper. (S)</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> agreed that the word “prompt” should
                        be added to the first element in the paper (“Prompt withdrawal of all Soviet
                        military forces . . . .”). (U)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> explained that the
                        preparation of the attached paper had focused on the basic elements of a
                        policy, and had not addressed a negotiating strategy. That was the reason
                        why the two additional elements identified by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> were not included. The
                        objective was to put together a reasonable policy package which would put
                        the onus on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. (C)</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> noted that the seventh
                        point was the most dangerous since it opened the possibility of negotiating
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> about security arrangements
                        in the region outside Afghanistan. The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                        agreed that we should not initially raise this point with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—at least not in this form—but that the
                        principle was essential. It would be preferable either to redraft the
                        statement or to hold it back for use if and when the Soviets introduced the
                        idea of negotiating rights for themselves in the region outside Afghanistan.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Warren Christopher</persName> thought it
                        important to include this point in case the package leaked out. (S)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> wondered if the sixth
                        element did not get us involved in a negotiation about the location of the
                        Afghan border. <pb n="636" facs="0681" xml:id="pg_636"/>Although we
                        recognize the Durand line, and we have recently reaffirmed that position,
                        the Durand line is not accepted by the Afghans and some others. The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> agreed that the sixth point should be made
                        a footnote to the third element concerning non-interference in the internal
                        affairs of Afghanistan. If asked, in that context, what borders would be
                        guaranteed, we would indicate our recognition of the Durand line as the
                        border we would recognize. (S)</p>
                    <p>With those changes, the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> approved the
                        elements proposed by the State Department. The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> recommended seeking Presidential approval in principle of
                        these elements before proceeding further. (C)</p>
                    <p> Approve the elements of the policy outlined in the attached paper, with the
                        changes as suggested above.</p>
                    <p> As amended.<note n="5" xml:id="d236fn5"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> did not mark either option.</note></p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> then discussed how this policy could
                        best be handled with the allies and the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> suggested taking it to the
                        other six allies first, getting their acceptance, and then deciding together
                        how best to present it to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. We may
                        not want to seek out the Soviets, but let them come to us. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said he would go over the
                        points informally with Sir Michael Palliser when he met with him today. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> said we needed to think
                        about alternative ways in which we might put the Soviets on the defensive.
                        For example, it might be desirable to call for an international conference
                        on Afghanistan, including the Islamic states, China, and others. Another
                        possibility might be to go to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General
                        Assembly. (S)</p>
                    <p>All agreed that we should take the leadership on this issue, and that we
                        needed to have a well-defined strategy before taking it to the allies. A
                        small group composed of State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> will meet to work out the next
                        steps. (S)</p>

                    <p>1. (S—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary. The Soviet argument that their move into Afghanistan was
                        necessitated by outside interference which threatened Soviet security
                        through the replacement of a friendly regime with a hostile bridgehead on
                        the Soviet Union’s southern border does not stand close scrutiny.
                        Nonetheless, the Soviets were genuinely concerned that internal instability
                        in a bordering country, with a Marxist government, if allowed to continue,
                        would damage Soviet interests and prestige. They undoubtedly suspected that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China would eventually be
                        tempted to exploit a sustained anti-Soviet insurgency, that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s excesses were damaging the prospects
                        for stabilizing the Marxist regime’s control of the country, and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s justifiable distrust of
                        Soviet intentions toward him would tempt him to consider a sharp turn away
                        from dependence on Soviet support with a consequent loss of Soviet prestige.
                        They also recognized both the ideological difficulty of explaining the
                        overthrow of a Marxist regime by an Islamic fundamentalist movement and the
                        effect of such an event on Eastern Europe, the Third World and the Muslim
                        population of Soviet Central Asia. We have yet to see any hard evidence that
                        the Soviet thrust into Afghanistan was part of a larger design aimed at the
                        Persian Gulf, warm water ports on the Indian Ocean or the encirclement of
                        China through Pakistan; but Soviet decision-makers were undoubtedly aware of
                        the opportunities that a stable Communist Afghanistan, subservient to the
                        Soviet Union, would create for future Soviet exploitation of targets of
                        opportunity in Southwest Asia and the Persian Gulf area.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviet minimal objective was therefore to secure a stable pro-Soviet
                        Afghan state. Soviet forces were intended to secure the major population
                        centers and transportation routes in Afghanistan, <pb n="638" facs="0683" xml:id="pg_638"/>while the brunt of counterinsurgency operations would
                        remain with Afghan armed forces directed by Soviet advisors and planners.
                        Believing that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations were
                        worsening and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Chinese relations
                        improving, even without Afghanistan, and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Iranian crisis would minimize the Islamic countries’
                        reactions, they were undeterred by potential damage to their international
                        interests. The Soviets failed to foresee that their flagrant intervention
                        would accelerate the disintegration of the Afghan Army, undermine Babrak’s
                        chances of gaining broad public support, and give new impetus to the
                        insurgency. They also seriously underestimated the damage to their relations
                        with the West and the Islamic world, but we believe they would have not
                        changed their decision to go into Afghanistan had they more accurately
                        assessed international reactions. In sum, we see no evidence that the
                        Soviets have abandoned their objective of establishing a stable, pro-Soviet
                        regime in Afghanistan through military means or that they are seriously
                        interested at this time, in a political solution that would necessitate
                        withdrawal of Soviet forces. They are keeping alive the possibility of
                        negotiations, however, in order to deflect attention from their pursuit of a
                        military solution, and are watching with detachment the West-West
                        negotiations on neutralization and other political solutions, hoping that
                        splits among the Western allies will widen and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will stand isolated in its measures taken in response to
                        the invasion. End summary.</p>
                    <p>4. Two-and-a-half months after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, many
                        questions remain about Soviet motives and objectives in that country. Since
                        submitting our assessment of Soviet motives immediately after the invasion
                            (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>), we see no reason to alter
                        fundamentally that analysis. Nevertheless, the intensity of Soviet efforts
                        to justify their move in terms of an alleged threat to Soviet security
                        caused by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Chinese intervention on
                        their southern border, the “signals” they are sending of interest in a
                        political settlement, and the willingness of some third parties, such as
                        India, to accept the plausibility of the Soviet version lead us to take
                        another look at Soviet motives and objectives and to update our original
                        analysis.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviets, in public and private statements, adamantly insist that their
                        only objectives in Afghanistan were and are the perpetuation of a stable,
                        friendly regime and preservation of the social achievements of the April
                        revolution. Soviet charges of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, Chinese
                        and other foreign instigation of the Afghan Muslim rebels, if not made out
                        of whole cloth, are at the least grossly exaggerated. Nonetheless, the
                        Soviets have been deeply concerned about the steady growth of an
                        anti-Communist, anti-Soviet fundamentalist Muslim and nationalistic
                        insurgent movement in Afghanistan since at least the time of the Herat
                        uprising in March of 1979. Unable to admit publicly the possibility of
                        widespread <pb n="639" facs="0684" xml:id="pg_639"/>spontaneous popular
                        resistance to a Marxist regime, the Soviets at that time began to concoct
                        charges of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and other foreign
                        interference. However, the Soviets undoubtedly did suspect that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China could not be counted on to
                        resist forever the temptation to exploit a growing anti-Soviet insurgency
                        and that the Soviet Union, if it failed to act, would eventually find itself
                        faced with a radical Islamic southern neighbor unfriendly to the Soviet
                        Union and susceptible to potential overtures from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China.</p>
                    <p>6. Soviet plotting against Afghan Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> in the months preceding the Soviet invasion has been
                        well documented elsewhere, as has <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s awareness of Soviet attitudes toward him. The Soviets
                        clearly believed that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s excesses
                        were primarily responsible for popular disaffection with the April 1978
                        revolution, that his removal was necessary to win the war against the
                        insurgents, and that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>
                        could be trusted to follow Soviet advice on broadening popular support for
                        the regime. Moreover, the deep mutual distrust and suspicion between the
                        Soviets and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> must have caused the
                        Soviets to consider the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, like Sadat and <persName corresp="#p_BMS_1">Siad
                            Barre</persName>, would suddenly turn against them and order the Soviet
                        advisors out of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>7. Either an insurgent victory or an anti-Soviet turnabout by <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> would have been a serious blow to
                        Soviet prestige and foreign policy interests. Moreover, the Soviets would
                        have had great ideological and political difficulties in explaining the
                        replacement of a socialist regime by an Islamic republic, in contrast to the
                        Iranian revolution which the Soviets portray as a progressive step from
                        monarchy. Not the least of Soviet concerns were the potentially troublesome
                        effects of the loss of a neighboring Marxist state, with which the Soviet
                        Union had a friendship treaty including a security commitment, on Eastern
                        Europe, other pro-Soviet “progressive” governments in the Third World and
                        even on the Muslim population of Soviet Central Asia. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has alluded to those concerns in
                        a conversation with a Western visitor.</p>
                    <p>8. We do not accept the thesis occasionally mooted that the move into
                        Afghanistan was a direct reaction to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> decision or to the growing ties between
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China. But it is certainly true
                        that the international situation at the end of 1979 was more propitious for
                        a Soviet move into Afghanistan than it might be later, if the Soviets had
                        let matters drift until they were faced with an imminent prospect of losing
                        Afghanistan. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations were
                        already worsening as a result of the dispute over the Soviet brigade in
                        Cuba, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> commitment to increase its
                        defense spending and its military presence in the Indian Ocean, the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> decision on <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> rejecting <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s initiative to forestall it, and rapidly improving
                        relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and China. The
                        Soviets thus saw poor immediate prospects for <pb n="640" facs="0685" xml:id="pg_640"/>obtaining <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        ratification, <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>, or other forward
                        movement in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations. Believing
                        that bilateral relations were unlikely to improve during a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> election year, they were undeterred by the
                        danger of further damage to those relations. The Soviets were also aware
                        that potential damage to their relations with the Islamic world would be
                        lessened by Islamic attention to growing <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> pressures on Iran, and that the possibility of driving
                        Iran into a close relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        was foreclosed by the hostage crisis. Also, they have made a deliberate
                        effort to deflect attention in the Arab world away from Afghanistan and onto
                        the Palestine issue where the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is
                        singled out as the true “enemy of Islam”.</p>
                    <p>9. We have seen no direct evidence that the Soviet move into Afghanistan was
                        part of a larger design to expand Soviet military power to the Persian Gulf,
                        to gain a land route to ports on the Indian Ocean or to encircle China. For
                        the time being the Soviets have their hands full in Afghanistan, but the
                        achievement of a stable Afghan Government subservient to the Soviet Union
                        would create future opportunities for expanding Soviet influence in
                        Southwest Asia and toward the Persian Gulf that must have occurred to Soviet
                        decision makers.</p>
                    <p>10. The minimal Soviet objectives in sending large numbers of Soviet combat
                        forces into Afghanistan were to prevent an insurgent victory, to replace the
                        unpopular <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regime with a more
                        representative leader, and ultimately to crush the insurgents and establish
                        a stable pro-Soviet regime. Aside from removing <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and installing Babrak in power, the principal mission
                        of the Soviet forces was to secure the major population centers, roads and
                        airfields. Babrak would thus be given time to broaden the revolution’s
                        political base, while the Afghan Army carried out counter-insurgency
                        operations under Soviet direction and planning. The Soviets handled the
                        affair clumsily and miscalculated the effect of their action on Afghan
                        nationalism. The invasion has accelerated the disintegration of the Afghan
                        Army, increased the unpopularity of the Kabul regime, and given new impetus
                        to the insurgency. The Soviets equally underestimated the long-term damage
                        to their relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and other
                        countries, particularly the Islamic countries.</p>
                    <p>11. We see no evidence, however, that basic Soviet objectives have changed as
                        a result of their unexpected difficulties or that they are yet willing to
                        withdraw without leaving behind a secure pro-Soviet Marxist regime. It is
                        interesting that some of our official contacts with lower and mid-level
                        Soviet officials have revealed a sense of miscalculation. For example, they
                        have called the Afghan venture a “snafu”, a “mistake”, a move guided by the
                        Soviet Union’s “pretensions”. However, the reasons which convinced the
                        leadership to make its move are no <pb n="641" facs="0686" xml:id="pg_641"/>less cogent now than they were before, even if the damage to their
                        relations with others has turned out to be greater than expected.</p>
                    <p>12. While the Soviets say they were perfectly happy with their relations with
                        Afghanistan before the April revolution, we see no possibility of turning
                        back the clock. Antipathy to the Soviet Union and its ideology has greatly
                        intensified in Afghanistan since April 1978 and particularly since the
                        Soviet invasion. It is thus difficult to conceive of a regime friendly to
                        the Soviet Union and preserving the gains of the April revolution which
                        could survive without the presence of Soviet forces. Assertions, such as
                        those by USA Institute Director <persName corresp="#p_AG_1">Arbatov</persName>, that the Soviet Union could establish a stable,
                        friendly regime within a few months, if outside interference is stopped,
                        cannot be taken at face value.<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">See <ref target="#d230">Document 230</ref>.</note> The roots of the
                        insurgency are in Afghanistan itself, and the result of a Soviet withdrawal
                        would be a Muslim victory or, at least, chaos and dismemberment of the
                        Afghan state.</p>
                    <p>13. Meanwhile, the Soviets are keeping alive talk about a political
                        settlement, but our impression is that this is simply a ploy designed to
                        focus attention on alleged <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        interference, defuse international pressures for a prompt Soviet withdrawal,
                        take the steam out of the Olympic boycott movement, buy time for continuing
                        military efforts to crush the insurgency, and preserve their options for the
                        future. They seem to be watching with a certain detachment what one of our
                        colleagues has termed the West-West negotiations on neutralization and other
                        political solutions, hoping that splits among the Western countries will
                        widen and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will stand isolated in
                        its measures taken in response to the invasion. Only when, and if, they
                        become convinced that they cannot achieve their objectives through military
                        means will the Soviets seriously consider a political settlement that would
                        bring about a Soviet withdrawal. For now, all available evidence indicates
                        that they will continue to pursue their objectives through military means,
                        even if this requires broader use of Soviet forces than they originally
                        anticipated.</p>

                    <p>The President began by saying that he wanted to try to keep the meeting short
                        and not go into great detail, but he wanted a general discussion about what
                        is taking place in our foreign and defense policies. It was his sense that
                        the last two weeks were the worst since he has been in office. We are
                        confronted by several important issues which are not directly related but
                        which are tied together in terms of the overall posture of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the impression that our country is
                        making at home and abroad. The President said that after a general review
                        this afternoon, he wished to get together again, perhaps at Camp David this
                        weekend, after our subordinates have had an opportunity to clarify the
                        issues and define the options.</p>
                    <p>The President’s analysis of the current situation was as follows: at best we
                        have a stagnant situation in Iran and Afghanistan, as well as in the
                        Israeli/Egyptian peace talks. We have a deteriorating position, and perhaps
                        worse, with our European Allies. Finally, our relationship with the Soviet
                        Union is dormant and perhaps deteriorating as well.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>As for Afghanistan, it was the President’s judgment the Soviets are going to
                        stay in that country for at least a year. He thought they were making
                        progress against the resistance and they were succeeding in driving a wedge
                        between ourselves and our Allies—with the help of the Allies, particularly
                        the French.</p>
                    <p><pb n="643" facs="0688" xml:id="pg_643"/>The President said it was important
                        to develop a definition, for ourselves and for our Allies, of a neutralist
                        Afghanistan and try to build world support for it along with a concomitant
                        condemnation of the Soviet military occupation. Such a concept would
                        facilitate enlisting European support for our efforts against the Soviet
                            invasion.<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, March 15, in preparation
                            for the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> concluded: “The next nine
                            months are going to be the most critical test we have faced with the
                            Soviets since the Korean war.” <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> based this analysis on the assumption that the
                            Soviet leadership, despite its surprise at the initial, vigorously
                            negative worldwide response to the intervention in Afghanistan, would
                            likely dig in its troops there and build both international and
                            political acceptance for the intervention as well as tactical gains in
                            Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> noted that
                            since January a series of missteps in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy had turned the tide in the Soviets’ favor.
                            These included: a split between the United States and its European
                            allies over how to respond to the crisis in Afghanistan; ongoing
                            Pakistani susceptibility to Soviet intimidation; and numerous
                            shortcomings in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> ability to
                            punish the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> with the Olympic
                            boycott and the grain and technology transfer embargoes. To mitigate
                            these problems, <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> counseled
                            that the United States must strengthen Afghan resistance forces with
                            Chinese and Pakistani help; increase pressure on the European allies for
                            a united front; challenge Soviet adventurism elsewhere through covert
                            means; increase the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            presence worldwide; and explore alternative channels for high-level

                            Afghanistan: 3–10/80) In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName>, March 17, <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName>’s basic assumption that the momentum was with
                            the Soviet Union, but doubted the efficacy of attempting to reverse it.
                            Instead, <persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> asserted, the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> capacity to defend its “vital
                            interests” in the region were limited: “We cannot, and hence should not,
                            seek to defend them where the Soviets have an overwhelming geopolitical
                            advantage. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>On the issue of the Europeans, the President thought that now that we have
                        our <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> proposals, we have an
                        opportunity to test their intentions. The French probably will not accept
                        tighter <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> rules, but we can put
                        pressure on them as well.</p>
                    <p>The only bright spot, said the President, is our effort to boycott the
                        Olympics. That seems to be gaining momentum every day.</p>
                    <p>As far as the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is concerned, the
                        President said that he had been toying with the idea of a frank and tough
                        letter to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>. It would make
                        clear that there would be no resumption of normal trading and commerce so
                        long as the Soviets are invading Afghanistan. At the same time, the letter
                        would make clear that we are prepared to take steps to improve our
                        relationship if the Soviets are prepared to have a neutral Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, they must realize that we will take the steps necessary to
                        protect our security, particularly since their actions threaten detente.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said he was clear in his own mind what we want on
                        Afghanistan neutrality, but he did not know whether the <pb n="644" facs="0689" xml:id="pg_644"/>French would go along. He thought it was
                        important that we stay close to the British whom he thought supported our
                        position fully. The President responded by saying that we should be prepared
                        to go public with our views on Afghan neutrality. The Secretary of State
                        agreed and suggested that we could be most effective by staying close to the
                        British. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> then
                        reviewed the points elaborating the elements of Afghan neutrality which had
                        been developed that morning in the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>
                            meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3">See <ref target="#d236">Document

                        <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName> commented that we should
                        be clear in our own minds whether the Soviet Union would accept these
                        principles. The President said that he assumed that they could not, but he
                        was concerned that the Soviets were getting away with their current
                        activities in terms of world opinion, indeed, in terms of our Allies’
                        opinions, too.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State thought that all the other European Allies would go
                        along with our definition of Afghan neutrality except the French. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName> added that the French may take
                        the same substantive position, but do not want to be linked to a collective
                        position.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that we have a
                        good case to present to our Allies on what the Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan means to them. When he tries it out on them, they admit that the
                        oil resources of the Persian Gulf are more important to them than to the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and that the implications of the
                        Soviet invasion of Afghanistan are more severe for them than for us. He
                        thought it would be useful for the President to give a speech supporting the
                        speeches already given by the Secretary of State and himself on the Afghan
                            issue.<note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4"><persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> delivered a speech on Afghanistan at the Chicago
                            Council of Foreign Relations, March 3, in which he acknowledged that no
                            quick solution to the crisis was within reach and a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response was required that balanced
                            firmness and “the indiscriminate confrontation of earlier times.” The
                            speech was reported in Bernard Gwerzman, “<persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> Urging a Balanced Response on Afghanistan,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, March 4, 1980, p. A3; and

                            delivered a speech on March 6 to the Council on Foreign Relations in New
                            York, that discussed the Afghan crisis in the context of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests in the Persian Gulf. An
                            excerpt from the speech was reproduced in the Middle East Research and
                            Information Project, <hi rend="italic">MERIP Reports</hi>, no. 90, The
                            Vietnam Syndrome (Sep. 1980), pp. 20–23. The speech is also printed in

                            63–67.</note> The Secretary of Defense expressed concern that the
                        Europeans may be so afraid of the Soviets that they want to appease them. On
                        the other hand, they may simply be deceiving themselves. He thought that we
                        should rub their noses in the strategic facts of life created by the Soviet
                        invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>As for the Soviets, he did not believe that we needed to change our policy of
                        being prepared to cooperate where possible, and to compete when necessary.
                        When they push, he said, we must push back <pb n="645" facs="0690" xml:id="pg_645"/>from a position of strength. He added that we also want
                        to move on arms control, but we cannot do this in the face of actions of the
                        sort going on in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> commented that the
                        Europeans understand the problem. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> himself had identified the Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan as a strategic threat. So it is not that they do not understand.
                        The fact is that they are afraid of the Soviet Union and they are trying to
                        preserve detente in Europe, a detente that is divided from Soviet aggressive
                        behavior in the rest of the world. Their second concern, he said, is that
                        the Europeans do not believe that we are consistent. So they do not want to
                        go along with us and then ultimately see us reverse our position. The
                        Germans are particularly concerned that should this happen, they will have
                        to pay a very high price for having supported us and then be left holding
                        the bag.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> thus said he favored a
                        constant, measured and assertive posture. No mixed signals and no radical
                        departures.</p>
                    <p>As for a letter to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>, he was
                        against it. Our main problem is that we have not been able to both
                        communicate effectively and convey patience. A letter, he said, is a dead
                        instrument. It does not really convey meanings very thoroughly. He thought
                        that conversations between Cy and <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> were the best avenue. It was a shame that we cannot
                        talk to others in the Soviet hierarchy, but <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> had confirmed to him that <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> was now the only interlocutor.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> might have been able to do it in
                        the past, but was no longer able to do so. He thought that a letter to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> or a meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> that was not well
                        prepared in advance would not be helpful. The key thing was for all of us in
                        all of our contacts with the Soviets to be steady in our position.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that the
                        neutralization scheme, as developed by the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>, put us in good posture. He thought that perhaps the
                        Islamic Foreign Ministers might be induced to put forward such a scheme when
                        they met.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> then said that the
                        major emerging issue from his analysis is whether we are going to stay
                        consistent. Thus he questioned the idea of any neutrality proposals or any
                        letter to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>. The Soviets feel
                        we are falling apart with the Pakistanis and that the Europeans are beating
                        a path to their door on the neutrality proposal. The Soviets are not
                        suggesting neutrality and for us to do so only undermines the strength and
                        credibility of our position. The Secretary of State disagreed with this
                        analysis. He said that we have to put the monkey on their back about
                        withdrawing. The President added that neutrality must be preceded by the
                        Soviet withdrawal. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>
                        replied that he could not see why we had to get into a discussion of <pb n="646" facs="0691" xml:id="pg_646"/>neutrality simply to put the issue
                        of withdrawal first and foremost. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Brown</persName> said that there is a connection since the Soviets
                        might withdraw with a subservient regime left behind.</p>
                    <p>The President said that Soviet withdrawal is not likely within a year. The
                        question is how to hold the Allies together during this period. If we only
                        emphasize withdrawal he thought that the Allies would desert us. He added
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had said in letters to
                        himself, to <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>, to <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> that the Soviets would
                        withdraw when their reasons for going into Afghanistan had been
                            eliminated.<note n="5" xml:id="d238fn5">The letter from <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is likely a reference to the
                            hotline message of December 29. See <ref target="#d114">Document
                                114</ref>.</note> That is a ridiculous position, but we still have
                        to put them on the defensive politically.</p>

                        Ambassadors a paper on “Elements for a Neutral and Non-Aligned Afghanistan”

                        the meeting. He said the “Elements” had not been prepared for use at any
                        specific event but as a contribution to the search for a common position
                        among us which could (1) develop ultimately into a sound basis for a
                        constructive Western approach and (2) help develop a structure which might
                        be useful eventually in resolving the problem in Afghanistan. The Soviets
                        appeared to be uninterested but not closing the door. He noted the
                        importance of avoiding the appearance of pursuing the Soviets and the need
                        to watch for shifts in the Soviet line.<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">An

                        The group then considered the Elements point by point.</p>
                    <p>Point One was generally acceptable to the group and several called it
                        essential. De Laboulaye described it as “the ultimate aim,” apparently
                        thinking that withdrawal might take place sequentially. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> made it clear that all Soviet
                        troops would have to come out first; otherwise we might expose ourselves to
                        a situation in which the Soviets would control the transport lines and
                        communication points with a reduced military force and claim that they had
                        returned the country to Afghan control.</p>
                    <p>Point Two drew considerable discussion. Hermes warned that the search for a
                        government acceptable to the Afghan people could go on for years and the
                        Soviets would continue to say that nothing was acceptable. De Laboulaye
                        speculated that there could be a new government in place before the Soviet
                        troops all withdrew and it could serve as a transitional government.
                        Henderson said that Point Two should be the outcome of Points One and Three,
                        i.e., withdrawal of forces and non-interference could create a state of
                        affairs which would permit the evolution of a government which would be
                        acceptable to the Afghan people.</p>
                    <p>Point Three led to a discussion of the Afghanistan/Pakistan boundary. Hermes
                        asked if we thought the Pakistanis would accept the Durand Line. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> thought they would.
                        Thereafter there was some discussion about whether the right words should be
                        “no interference” or “no intervention” since a range of activities such as
                        radio broadcasts could lead to a situation where it would be hard to
                        differentiate between normal contacts and interference. In the end the group
                        preferred the words “intervention by neighboring other states” rather than
                        “by its neighbors or any other state.”</p>
                    <p>Point Four was reasonably acceptable to the group and Henderson thought it
                        would be acceptable to his government.</p>
                    <p>Point Five. Henderson was worried that the proposal for guarantees was too
                        sweeping and implied that the guarantor powers might have to use force; he
                        did not think Britain would be ready to go to war automatically in such a
                        situation. Hermes as well thought that the countries involved could not give
                        substance to guarantees. Henderson continued that any breach of neutrality
                        or interference would call for the parties to re-establish the status quo.
                        The group were inclined to <pb n="650" facs="0695" xml:id="pg_650"/>think
                        that Points Five and Three might be brought together with language calling
                        for something along the lines of “respect by neighboring states for the
                        territorial integrity, sovereignty and neutrality and for the principle of
                        non-intervention in Afghanistan’s internal affairs.”</p>
                    <p>Point Six. There was no quarrel with this formulation. De Laboulaye had some
                        intellectual difficulties, observing that France retained an open mind on
                        neutralization in Southwest Asia.</p>
                    <p>There was a brief discussion of next steps. Hermes thought that the proposal
                        should be kept in the backyard of the Islamic countries. Pansa reminded that
                        memories are short. De Laboulaye thought we should proceed bilaterally.
                        Hermes stressed that India is the key country in this matter.</p>

                        the Chinese that complete Soviet withdrawal had to be a pre-condition to any
                        other action and the Chinese gave the impression that they could live with
                        the approach. On the Olympics, China wholeheartedly supported the boycott
                        and the alternative games. On Pakistan the Chinese urged us to be patient as
                        Pakistan decided its strategy towards its neighbors, and they stressed the
                        need for other countries to supplement Chinese efforts to provide military
                        aid to Islamabad. They had expressed a willingness to work toward improved

                                to their memorandum and seen by the President, omitted the clause at
                                the end of item 4: “except by agreement of the guarantors.” They
                                explained “this was originally designed to permit foreign advisors
                                and peacekeeping forces, on a case-by-case basis, but only by
                                collective agreement. With the omission of the concept of
                                ‘guarantors,’ L believes this clause serves no purpose and that any
                                deployment of peacekeeping forces could be dealt with through
                                over-riding provisions of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>

                                to ensure that posts could “respond coherently” in the effort to
                                find an “acceptable political solution in Afghanistan.” (National

                    </list>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> opened the conversation
                        by insisting on the need to maintain channels of communication between us, a
                        sentiment with which I readily agreed. (U)</p>
                    <p>It was particularly important for us to understand, he continued, the sour
                        view of the US that is now widespread in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, not only in official circles, but among the general
                        populace as well. He said he was struck during his recent home leave by the
                        fact that most people who specialize in foreign affairs were taken aback by
                        the US “overreaction” to Afghanistan. We, of course, understood that there
                        would be a strong response, said <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>. That was unavoidable. But what surprised us
                        was the vehemence of the response, the language used, and the willingness to
                        throw away what had been built up painfully over almost a decade. (S)</p>
                    <p>This contrasts markedly with Soviet behavior in Vietnam in 1972, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> went on. When the Americans
                        were blockading Haiphong and bombs were falling right next to Soviet ships,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> nevertheless went ahead with the
                        first Moscow Summit and the signing of the basic agreements which led to the
                        period of detente, a period which has now ended. There were those who
                        counseled a cancellation of the 1972 Summit, but their advice was rejected.
                        We had a sense of balance and knew what was important. It is that sense of
                        balance which seems to us completely absent in the US reaction to
                        Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                    <p>The situations are hardly comparable, I replied. The bombing of North Vietnam
                        was in response to a major direct invasion of South Vietnam by mainline
                        North Vietnamese divisions supplied by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. That invasion was planned with the support and
                        foreknowledge of Moscow. It is not the Soviet Union which deserves praise
                        for entering <pb n="653" facs="0698" xml:id="pg_653"/>a detente relationship
                        with the US during the Vietnam war, I said, but rather the other way around.
                        American soldiers were, after all, being killed and maimed by
                        Soviet-supplied and Soviet-encouraged armies. Nevertheless, we were willing
                        to conclude the basic arms control negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> which ushered in the period of detente.
                        I pointed out that from 1964–1966 I had served in our Embassy in Moscow as
                        the officer in the Political Section covering Soviet relations with Asia,
                        and could personally attest to the fact that Soviet reaction to the war in
                        Vietnam was far more offensive to my government and far more “unbalanced”
                        than Washington’s reaction to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
                        Furthermore, I continued, I was surprised to hear him allude to Soviet
                        behavior in Vietnam in the context of Afghanistan. Surely he was not
                        proposing that the US model its behavior toward the conflict in Afghanistan
                        on Soviet behavior in Vietnam? (S)</p>
                    <p>Such was not his intention, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> acknowledged with an icy smile. (S)</p>
                    <p>In fact, despite the extremely unhelpful Soviet attitude toward Vietnam, I
                        said, both Presidents Johnson and Nixon clearly desired better relations
                        with the Soviets and regarded this as a fundamental aim of US foreign
                        policy. I could assure him personally, I continued, that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> had a deep commitment to detente,
                        to improved US-Soviet relations, and to the establishment of viable,
                        reciprocal, and mutually beneficial arms control agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It was these very goals which had made
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan so disappointing and repugnant to us.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>The difference with previous administrations, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> rejoined, was that they placed US-Soviet
                        relations at the center of American foreign policy. The great mistake that
                        this administration had made was to reduce the focus on this vital subject.
                        A supreme irony is the fact that Afghanistan clearly restored US-Soviet
                        relations to the primacy it should have had all along for the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration, and this was
                        clearly shown in the President’s January 4 speech.<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">See <ref target="#d145fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                145</ref>.</note> (S)</p>
                    <p>In any case, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said, many
                        people in Moscow had given up on the idea of trying to establish good
                        relations with the US. There are some, such as <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Korniyenko</persName>, who are genuinely in favor of restoring
                        US-Soviet relations to an even keel. But such people only represent 20–30
                        percent of the policymakers. Those who maintain that there is no point in
                        going on with such a policy represent 60–70 percent, and this includes not
                        only foreign ministry officials, but people in the Central Committee as
                        well. Many of my colleagues were really taken aback by the pointless nature
                        of the American response, Bessmert<pb n="654" facs="0699" xml:id="pg_654"/>nykh said. It is “a policy of pin pricks.” Nothing you have said or done
                        will have any real influence over us. I hope nobody within the
                        Administration believes that the efforts you have made can accomplish
                        anything. Such is not the nature of the Russian people. In fact, your
                        propagandists made a great mistake in announcing that the grain embargo
                        would affect Soviet living standards. That kind of threat has a very bad
                        effect among the Russians. We do not like to be menaced by foreigners. You
                        have lived in Moscow and you know that Americans are not unpopular there.
                        There is much good will still left over from the war. Even if the government
                        would want to change the views of the Soviet people, it cannot do it.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>Another real irony is that despite the differences in our two systems the
                        American government can have a profound effect on public opinion, which can
                        change overnight, whereas my government cannot reshape the basic attitudes
                        of the Soviet population, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said. Nevertheless, I can assure you in all
                        sincerity that both in Lithuania, where I spent my vacation, as well as in
                        Moscow, quite ordinary people voiced their indignation to me about this
                        American announcement. After all, a great many people in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> did not even know we were buying grain
                        from you. They only learned about it when our press carried reports of your
                        statement. Furthermore, we are not in the least concerned about your various
                        economic measures against us. It has not exactly escaped our notice that
                        your allies are crawling all over each other trying to replace the US for
                        commercial benefit, he said. You have been reading our press and you must
                        know the effect this has had. Before Afghanistan, both <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> and I had some influence in toning
                        down the way our journalists treated US affairs. But now they have full
                        freedom to give vent to their bitterest feelings about the United States,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said. (S)</p>
                    <p>I had indeed noticed the way our leaders have been treated recently in the
                        Soviet press, I replied, and consider it most unfortunate. Personal attacks
                        on the President or his close associates do not serve any useful purpose. I
                        am not sure what your journalists think they are doing, but they should
                        understand that personal slanders of the President cannot have a good effect
                        on future US-Soviet relations, and this is not just a question of the next
                        several months. (S)</p>
                    <p>I agree that some of our writers may have gone overboard about some
                        Administration figures and that this really serves no purpose, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> replied. Nevertheless, you
                        should understand that we follow what is said about us very closely, and it
                        is difficult to restrain our journalists. We certainly understand and
                        anticipate that we are dealing with an administration that will be here for
                        another five years. <pb n="655" facs="0700" xml:id="pg_655"/>It is our
                        prediction that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        will be nominated and reelected, and our expectation that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> will be a part, an important
                        part, of the new administration. Nevertheless, our feeling is that the
                        rhetoric you have used about the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has
                        exceeded what was really necessary. You have to understand that we are no
                        longer living in the world of the 1950s and 1960s. At some point we will
                        return to a detente relationship. It may be in two years, it may be four
                        years from now, but we have to live together in this world. We have no
                        choice about that. But it will never be the same as it was. It will have to
                        be an entirely different track, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said. (S)</p>
                    <p>Based on a close reading of your press and of what I know about Afghanistan,
                        what is not clear to me, I responded, is whether you fully understand that
                        the current low state of US-Soviet relations is entirely the fault of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It was, after all, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> which invaded Afghanistan and brought
                        about the very dangerous situation which now faces both of us in Southwest
                        Asia. (U)</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan is only the latest in a series of events, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> rejoined. Relations were on
                        the way down beginning last summer and they have gotten steadily worse ever
                        since then. We had absolutely no choice but to take the action we did in
                        Afghanistan. It was a state along our borders. Our vital interests were
                        involved. Hostile states were disturbing our security. We have no intention
                        of remaining in Afghanistan. We will get out. But we could not let the
                        situation simply fall apart. (S)</p>
                    <p>You did not use your security needs to justify the invasion, I retorted. You
                        did not say that this was a vital interest of the Soviet Union and therefore
                        you had no choice but to invade Afghanistan. On the contrary, you said you
                        were invited into Afghanistan by the legally constituted government and that
                        you had every right to be there because you have a treaty with the Afghans.
                        That kind of justification can apply anywhere in the world. And if the
                        superpowers arrogate to themselves the right to use combat forces whenever
                        they feel like it, then we will truly be living in a dangerous situation in
                        the ’80s and ’90s. (S)</p>
                    <p>You say that Afghanistan involved your “vital interests,” I continued. But
                        you do not explain why it involved your vital interests. The fact of the
                        matter is that Soviet vital interests were far better served by the Daoud
                        government, when Afghanistan was a true buffer state. The President has said
                        that this is the most dangerous situation we have faced since the Second
                        World War, and I am firmly convinced that this is an accurate statement. My
                        hope is that the Soviet government will perceive the danger and that a
                        reasonable solution will be worked out to resolve this problem. (S)</p>
                    <p>But your allies are not in accord with your assessment, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> interjected. They have said
                        so publicly. More convincingly, they <pb n="656" facs="0701" xml:id="pg_656"/>told this to us privately. Nevertheless, I agree with you that the problem
                        of how to define vital interest is a real one. The heart of our problem is
                        that we seem to disagree on that definition. We do not understand how an
                        area halfway around the globe can be a “vital interest” to another country.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>I hope it is very clear, I stated, that the United States regards that area
                        of the world as a vital interest. The State of the Union speech is not in
                        the least ambiguous, and I would hope that there was clear understanding
                        about this very important point in Moscow. (S)</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan was, of course, a buffer state in the past, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said. We were perfectly
                        comfortable with Daoud—and with the King, for that matter. But one could
                        only seriously regard it as a buffer state when the United States had 40,000
                        servicemen in Iran, a country that is no longer the same. It has changed and
                        changed for good. So Afghanistan is no longer a buffer state between us. You
                        no longer control either Iran or Pakistan. It is Iran rather than
                        Afghanistan that has perhaps become a buffer state. We are dealing with a
                        changing area, and the United States always finds it difficult to accept
                        change. (S)</p>
                    <p>You state that the Daoud government was perfectly acceptable to you, I
                        rejoined. Nevertheless, you felt it necessary to support those who had shot
                        and killed Daoud and who had overthrown his government. Your response was to
                        prop up the government of Daoud’s killers by increasing your military
                        personnel and economic assistance tenfold, despite the fact that the new
                        Afghan government was following policies which were highly unpopular and
                        which eventually led to the current destabilizing crisis in the area.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>It is true that support for revolutionary movements is a fundamental aspect
                        of our foreign policy, said <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>. We have no choice in such situations. For
                        better or worse, we feel we have to support revolutionary movements. “If
                        anyone wants Soviet support, all they have to do is start a revolution.”
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>While we might not like your various actions in Afghanistan and elsewhere, I
                        replied, we nevertheless can accept that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has a right to assist those governments and political
                        forces with which it is sympathetic. This could even include military
                        assistance. However, where one has to draw the line is armed combat. The
                        introduction of Soviet combat troops, or even the introduction of the troops
                        of Soviet surrogates, such as the Cubans or Vietnamese, creates situations
                        which make a detente relationship between the superpowers impossible to
                        maintain. Furthermore, it makes no sense to view the invasion of Afghanistan
                        in isolation. In 1975 the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> shipped a
                        Cuban army to Angola. In 1977 and again in 1978, Soviet generals commanded
                        Cuban troops in combat in Ethiopia. Then the Vietnamese attacked Cambodia.
                        Finally, at the end of 1979, you invaded Afghanistan with Soviet <pb n="657" facs="0702" xml:id="pg_657"/>troops—the first time in 30 years that
                        Soviet troops have transgressed the boundaries you achieved as a result of
                        World War II. This is not something which you could expect the United States
                        or its allies to ignore. It sets a remarkably dangerous precedent and is an
                        event to which we have to respond unambiguously, so that your government
                        does not mistake the depth and gravity of our reaction or what our reaction
                        will be if this type of behavior continues. (S)</p>
                    <p>The fact of the matter is, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> replied, that your allies see the situation
                        entirely differently than you do. Not only do they not regard Afghanistan as
                        endangering them in any way, they rather see it as an opportunity to derive
                        commercial advantage in their dealing with us. Many people in Moscow are
                        aware of this and are trying to take advantage of it. <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> and I have worked very hard to
                        build up US-Soviet trade, and now it will all go to the West Europeans and
                        the Japanese. (S)</p>
                    <p>More important than trade, I said, is whether the Soviet Union thinks it has
                        the right to introduce armed combat troops anywhere in the world to support
                        “revolutionary movements” wherever they exist. We have the right to do
                        whatever you do, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        replied. There has been a great change in the world. This is no longer the
                        ’50s or ’60s, he repeated. And what has changed is that we have achieved
                        military parity with you not only in the strategic field, but in
                        conventional arms as well. You have your troops all over the world, half a
                        million of them. You do not ask our permission to go into places like Korea.
                        Your troops are there not only to defend that territory, but to prop up the
                        local government. There is no reason for you to have any rights which we do
                        not have. We must insist on equality. It is hard for you to adjust to this,
                        but you must come to realize that it is a new fact of life. You have lived
                        many years in my country and you understand very well that we are quite
                        cautious. We do not undertake actions such as those in Afghanistan without
                        fully realizing their implications. We moved only to protect our vital
                        interests. We do not consider that Afghanistan is a precedent for future
                        action. (S)</p>
                    <p>Although you say this, and might even believe it, I replied, there is no way
                        that you can know for certain that what you are saying is the truth. Events
                        have a way of becoming precedents which can ultimately surprise the people
                        who triggered those same events. It is therefore essential that Afghanistan
                        indeed not be a precedent for future Soviet actions. US-Soviet relations
                        cannot stand future Afghanistans. We therefore must find a viable way to
                        resolve this problem. The President suggested one such way when he indicated
                        that the US is ready to support efforts by the international community to
                        restore a neutral, non-aligned Afghan government that would be responsive to
                        the wishes of the Afghan people. The essence of a settlement must therefore
                            <pb n="658" facs="0703" xml:id="pg_658"/>consist of prompt and complete
                        Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, coupled with agreement by all interested
                        parties that such a government be installed in Kabul. (S)</p>
                    <p>The key to a settlement must be the stopping of assistance to the rebel
                        forces, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> countered. Once
                        such assistance has ceased, we will be able to resolve this problem quickly
                        and satisfactorily. (S)</p>
                    <p>The problem does not arise because of outside forces, I rejoined, but rather
                        because of the Soviet invasion. A genuine national liberation movement
                        exists within Afghanistan. In fact, it is not one movement but several, with
                        roots in different regions within the country. Resistance arose through
                        spontaneous combustion, not outside help, and Afghanistan was aflame before
                        the world knew anything about it. There were 300,000 refugees in Pakistan
                        less than a year ago. Today there are more than 600,000. These people left
                        their country because they could not support the government which existed
                        there. It is their determination to carry on the struggle which makes a long
                        and bitter war inevitable unless some means is found of installing a
                        government in Kabul which is to some degree responsive to their wishes. If
                        your aim is to establish in Kabul a government that is completely under the
                        thumb of Moscow, a government similar to the one that exists, for example,
                        in Ulan Bator, then it is difficult to foresee anything other than great
                        difficulty in Afghanistan itself and a downward spiral in US-Soviet
                        relations. And if we are to avoid confrontations, it seems to me essential
                        that we come to some agreement as to rules of superpower behavior in the
                        coming decades. We have signed several agreements on mutual behavior, but
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> does not seem to abide by such
                        agreements. (S)</p>
                    <p>The people of Mongolia are very satisfied with the government they have. And
                        you should know that the Soviet Union always abides by agreements which it
                        signs, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> replied. (S)</p>
                    <p>At that point I read him the following from the Agreement on the Prevention
                        of Nuclear War:</p>

                    <p>Afghanistan is far away from you, and we do not think that what has happened
                        there may endanger international peace and security, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> replied, smiling faintly. In
                        any case, we have to live with each other and something will be worked out.
                        But I do not see how <pb n="659" facs="0704" xml:id="pg_659"/>anything can
                        happen during 1980, since it will obviously take some time before we can
                        resolve the Afghanistan question. And 1981 will also be a difficult year
                        when agreements will be expiring. It may take two years, it may take longer,
                        but I am confident that reasonable relations will eventually be restored
                        between us, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> repeated.

                    <p>1. (C) Afghan insurgent groups can be divided into two major categories;
                        those groups based and operating within Afghanistan and those groups
                        (exiles) based in Pakistan but operating in Afghanistan. The former
                        represents the major ethnic groups (Pushtu, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek and Aimak).
                        Little is known of their exact numbers of leaders. Afghanistan’s tribes,
                        especially the Pushtu tribes, have historically resisted government
                        encroachments. Resistance is generally confined to ethnic or tribal
                        boundaries. Islam, resentment of foreign intervention, and antipathy to
                        Russians serve as unifying motives, however, none are strong enough to
                        produce a coordinated rebellion. The second category, exiles based in
                        Pakistan, is comprised of several major groups whose number changes almost
                        daily with the formation of new groups, <pb n="660" facs="0705" xml:id="pg_660"/>groups formed by cross-alliances and membership in more
                        than one group. The major exile groups are: A. (U) the Islamic Revolution
                        Movement, headed by Mohammad Nabi Mohammedi; B. (U) the Afghanistan National
                        Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_ANLF_1">ANLF</gloss>), headed by
                        Sebqatullah Mojadedi; C. (U) the Jamaat-i-Islami Afghanistan, headed by
                        Burhanhddin Rabbani; D. (U) the Hezb-e-Islami (<gloss target="#t_HI_1">HI</gloss>), headed by <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Gulbuddin
                            Hekmatyar</persName>; E. (U) the National Front for the Islamic
                        Revolution of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_NFIRA_1">NFIRA</gloss>), headed
                        by <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Sayed Gailani</persName>. These groups vary
                        from right-wing professional revolutionaries to Islamic orientation.</p>
                    <p>2. (U) Exact numbers for members of each category are virtually impossible to
                        ascertain since members of tribes operating in Afghanistan can be claimed,
                        at various times, to be conducting the insurgency either independently or as
                        members of one or more of the exile groups based in Pakistan. However, the
                            <gloss target="#t_NFIRA_1">NFIRA</gloss> group, headed by <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName>, has claimed approximately 70,000
                        members.</p>
                    <p>3. (S) The insurgents evince virtually no interest, with minor exceptions, in
                        territorial control in a conventional sense. Therefore strongholds in the
                        conventional sense are non-existent. Currently the insurgents hold no major
                        city. However, with territorial control being highly relevant to the
                        government, fighting has gravitated towards towns where government forces
                        are located. The best approach in delineating rebel areas of operation is by
                        province. The provinces where rebel activity is currently most severe are
                        Kabul, Paktia, Laghman, Bamian and Ghowr. Rebel activity has also been
                        severe in Konar and Nangarhar Provinces, however, recent Afghan/Soviet
                        combined army operations and continued presence in these areas has restored
                        a modicum of government control. Conditions suggest that Kandahar, Kunduz
                        and Baglan are now beset with serious rebellion. In other provinces moderate
                        levels of rebellion occur. The rebellion is currently least serious in
                        Faryab, Jowzjan, and Bulkh. The arrival of Soviet forces in Takhar and
                        Badakhshan Provinces has tended to stabilize conditions there.</p>
                    <p>4. (S) Afghan insurgents use a variety of weapons ranging from side arms to
                        artillery, the majority of which were either captured or acquired from
                        Afghan Army units or personnel who defected. These weapons include 76, 82
                        and 107mm mortars; 76mm mountain artillery; 107mm recoilless; 122mm guns;
                        122mm howitzers; tanks; APCs; <gloss target="#t_AAA_1">AAA</gloss> guns;
                        rocket launchers; English .303, Kalashnikov and Dushka rifles; bombs;
                        grenades; mines and various side arms. Tactics range from simple ambushes of
                        convoys to attacks on Soviet and <gloss target="#t_Af_1">Af</gloss> Army
                        units and include <gloss target="#t_HandI_1">H and I</gloss> fire, mining
                        roads, blowing bridges, opening floodgates, sabotaging water supplies,
                        cutting telephone lines, and destroying electric power plants.</p>
                    <p>5. (U) As stated, the vast majority of the insurgent equipment was obtained
                        in raids or from deserting <gloss target="#t_Af_1">Af</gloss> Army units and
                        personnel. <pb n="661" facs="0706" xml:id="pg_661"/>Financial support is
                        more difficult to determine. Obtaining funds is one of the primary aims of
                        the exile groups in Pakistan although their success is unknown. Egypt has
                        publicly stated that it will train and arm Afghan insurgents. Iran has also
                        pledged support however, the form it will take is unknown. Saudi Arabia is
                        allegedly also providing support. Currently we have no firm evidence to
                        confirm or deny support from either Pakistan or China.</p>
                    <p>6. (C) The tenor of the insurgency during the winter months far exceeded
                        expectations. A lull was expected in both the insurgency and Soviet/Afghan
                        Army operations in order to refit, retrain and plan operations for the
                        upcoming summer months. However, this was not the case and as the weeks
                        progressed the insurgency gained momentum, most recently manifested in the
                        general strike and demonstrations in Kabul. Historically insurgent
                        operations increase in the warmer months. This, in combination with the
                        increasing support of urban populations, continued defections of Afghan Army
                        personnel, innate hatred of the Russians and the relative successes enjoyed
                        to date portend increased insurgent activity during the summer months.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan: An Aberration or a Symptom?</p>
                    <p>While there is genuinely solid unanimity in your Administration regarding the
                        measures that you have adopted, and this unanimity has been strengthened by
                        regular <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss> meetings, you should be aware
                        that in the background there still lurks a fundamental disagreement, which
                        has potential policy implications. I can best summarize it in <pb n="662" facs="0707" xml:id="pg_662"/>terms of two conflicting interpretations of
                        what is basically involved in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan: some see
                        it as an aberration from, and others as symptomatic of, Soviet behavior.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Aberration</p>
                    <p>Those who see it as an aberration tend to feel that the primary motive for
                        the Soviet action was defensive, that the Soviets do not have longer-term
                        regional ambitions beyond Afghanistan, and that they are likely to consider
                        seriously some mutually acceptable formula for a solution to the problem
                        generated by their invasion of Afghanistan. Proponents of this school of
                        thought do not deny that the Soviet Union occasionally acts aggressively,
                        but see that largely as an expedient reaction to opportunities rather than
                        as a manifestation of a more sustained trend. Because of that, one is
                        entitled to nurture hopes of a relatively early return to more normal
                        East-West relations, including genuine progress on some of the more
                        important bilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet issues.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Symptom</p>
                    <p>Those who argue otherwise feel that the Soviet Union is currently in an
                        assertive phase of its history, with the acquisition of military power
                        giving its foreign policy both greater scope and more frequent temptations
                        to use its power to advance policy goals. Soviet behavior is still prudent,
                        but it does involve a gradual shift from political encouragement of often
                        geographically remote ideological sympathizers, to more direct support of
                        them through the use of Cuban proxies in the mid-’70s, to even more direct
                        projection of Soviet military power itself currently. In other words, Soviet
                        behavior is symptomatic of a long-term historical drive, with military power
                        supplanting Marxist ideology as its basic dynamic source.</p>
                    <p>As you can probably anticipate, I lean to the second school of thought. I
                        would also argue additionally that there are certain constants in Soviet
                        foreign policy, and the drive toward the Persian Gulf is one of them. I am
                        struck by the fact that the draft agreement between the Soviet Union and
                        Nazi Germany, which was being negotiated secretly between Molotov and
                        Ribbentrop in 1940, included the following passage: “The Soviet Union
                        declares that its territorial aspirations center south of the national
                        territory of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean.”
                        Moreover, the German Ambassador reported on November 25, 1940, that Molotov
                        told him that the Soviet Union would associate itself with the Axis powers,
                        “provided that the area south of Batum and Baku in the general direction of
                        the Persian Gulf is recognized as the center of the aspirations of the
                        Soviet Union.”</p>
                    <p>The argument between those who think that Afghanistan is an aberration and
                        those who think it is a symptom is not merely an <pb n="663" facs="0708" xml:id="pg_663"/>intellectual exercise. Though we are all in agreement
                        with what needed to be done, I suspect that there are potential differences
                        among us about the future (and these differences could complicate planning
                        for the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Summit)<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">The next <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Summit
                            meeting was held in Bonn June 10, 1982.</note> how long should the
                        present policy be maintained; to what extent should the Allies be pressed to
                        recognize the wider and strategic character of the Soviet challenge; how
                        energetically should we try to reinforce the Western presence in the Persian
                        Gulf/Indian Ocean area; how important is it to beef up Pakistan; what is the
                        strategic urgency of moving more rapidly on the Palestinian problem; and,
                        finally, how fruitful are likely to be any early efforts to improve
                        relations with the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>On that last point, my view is that in a quiet but persistent way we need to
                        replicate in this new third central strategic zone (southwest Asia) what we
                        have done earlier in Western Europe and the Far East: create a sense of
                        security, and halt Soviet expansionism. Once our efforts are credible, I
                        think we have a very good chance to return to detente and to seek the humane
                        and morally imperative goals with which I hope history will identify
                        you.</p>

                    <p>The Soviets have not rejected the notion of negotiation about Afghanistan.
                        But, to the extent that Moscow has developed and elaborated its views, the
                        stated Soviet terms for withdrawal from Afghanistan appear to be even
                        stiffer now than they were on December 27.</p>

                        Afghanistan, they promised simply to withdraw when foreign interference

                        the US and Afghanistan’s neighbors acceptable to Kabul as a pre-condition
                        for withdrawal, and has increasingly identified itself with maintaining the

                            around Afghanistan. Thus it is now up to the countries involved in the
                            subversive anti-Afghan activities and in the aggression unleashed
                            against Afghanistan to cease that aggression and to respond positively

                        decided not to kill off Western speculation about negotiation in the hope
                        that divergent views might emerge thus allowing Moscow greater room for
                        diplomatic maneuvering between the West Europeans and Washington.</p>
                    <p>What emerged from the French and British contacts was the impression that the
                        Soviets have not developed an initiative of their own for settlement or
                        negotiation. In general, their current position seems to be a piecemeal
                        series of responses to British and French queries on withdrawal of Soviet
                        troops, guarantees and neutralization.</p>

                    <p>The original December 27 Soviet position was simply that Soviet troops would
                        be withdrawn when the stated reason for their dispatch in the first

                        guarantee that outside interference, once stopped, will not be resumed.</p>

                    <p>According to the Zemskov non-paper delivered to the British on March 3, “one

                        Afghanistan.” Thus, there can be no discussions of any kind until outside
                        interference is stopped.</p>
                    <p>During the de Leusse visit in early March, the French inquired as to whether
                        the Soviets expected the US to admit that it was guilty of interfering in
                            Afghanistan.<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">During a meeting with the

                            Afghanistan: 1) France understood the insurgency as “chiefly
                            characterized by the revolt of an entire people against a foreign
                            intervention;” 2) the situation had compelled the Soviets to become
                            further enmeshed in Afghanistan; 3) Afghanistan threatened détente
                            between the Soviet Union and Western Europe, and Soviet leadership “must
                            make a political decision to resolve the situation;” 4) tensions
                            continued to rise as time passed; and 5) France believed only a
                            “political solution” could resolve the crisis. That solution would
                            include three elements: “withdrawal of foreign military forces from
                            Afghanistan,” self-determination for the Afghan people, and “Afghanistan
                            should not constitute a threat to its neighbors, and guaranteeing in

                    <p>In framing their position this way, the Soviets are basically insisting that
                        the US and Afghanistan’s neighbors accept responsibility for the insurgency
                        and the Soviet reaction. They are thus arguing implicitly that the causes of
                        Kabul’s problems are entirely external and that the yardstick by which
                        Moscow would measure cessation of interference would be abatement of rebel

                    <p>Cessation of foreign interference in itself would not, apparently, be
                        sufficient to lead to a Soviet withdrawal. Moscow has added that there must
                        be “guarantees” that interference would not resume. The Soviets have not
                        spelled out precisely what they mean by guarantees. Indeed, it seems
                        unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had any plan
                        in mind, when <pb n="666" facs="0711" xml:id="pg_666"/>he first used the
                        term on February 22. The Soviet position which emerged from their talks with
                        the British and the French is still vague:</p>
                    <quote><p>—The Soviets see the notion of guarantees as the result of some sort
                            of negotiation in which the US and Afghanistan’s neighbors would
                            “guarantee” its security. The participants in any such negotiation would
                            be the US, Pakistan, China, possibly Iran, and Afghanistan. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would not be required to give
                            guarantees since—by Soviet lights—it is not interfering.</p>

                            mediation, the Soviets told the French that the Afghan government alone
                            was the judge of what its security needs were, and that “no
                            international mechanism was needed.”</p></quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nyet to Neutralization</p>
                    <p>Given the Soviet position on negotiations and withdrawal, it is not
                        surprising that Moscow has rejected the notion of the “neutralization” of
                        Afghanistan raised by the British. On the most basic level, the Soviets
                        simply refuse to draw a distinction between neutral and non-aligned or
                        accept the argument that pro-Soviet is not non-aligned.</p>
                    <p>More specifically, the Soviets have termed the British concept of
                        neutralization “unacceptable” on the grounds that it is intended to
                        undermine the legitimacy of the current Kabul regime and thus constitutes
                        interference in internal Afghan affairs. As the British were told on March
                        3, questions on the international status and social system of Afghanistan,
                        as well as the composition of its government, cannot be a matter for
                        political settlement. In the Soviet view, the pro-Soviet international
                        alignment and socialist political orientation of Kabul were fixed by the
                        April 1978 revolution and cannot be the topics of negotiations since this
                        would “constitute inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of a
                        sovereign state.”</p>
                    <p>This latter point perhaps reflects the most dramatic shift in the Soviet
                        position since late 1979. Moscow has now committed itself more than ever
                        before to the preservation of the pro-Soviet Marxist regime and not just the
                        maintenance of a friendly regime in Kabul. This point was underscored by

                            saying: “Now, when it has become necessary for imperialists to recognize

                    <p>To the extent that the Soviets find they have to elaborate on the theme of

                            operations into Pakistan conducted by Soviet forces. The key judgments
                            of that assessment were: “a) The probability that the Soviets will
                            conduct cross border operations is low until they determine that present
                            military and political efforts to control the flow of men and material
                            into Afghanistan will not succeed; b) Soviet efforts to seal the border
                            will not succeed. Therefore, when the Soviets reach this conclusion and
                            if they are not able to neutralize the resistance in Afghanistan, the
                            probability that cross-border operations will be conducted will be very
                            high; c) Soviets have the capability militarily to launch cross-border
                            operations at any time; d) Political activities, such as increasingly
                            strong, public, diplomatic demarches protesting Pakistan support to
                            insurgents, are likely to provide the principal indication of impending

                        establish eligibility for relief supplies, and about 650,000 are already

                        MILITARY INTERVENTION CAPABILITIES (U)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>(S) The Soviets have committed some 105,000 troops in support of their
                        military operations in Afghanistan. This force, albeit substantial, amounts
                        to only a small portion of the total Soviet military force structure. Most
                        of the ground and air units involved in the Afghan action have been drawn
                        from the contiguous Turkestan and Central Asia Military Districts.</p>
                    <p>(S) Despite the already sizable commitment, as many as 50,000 to 60,000
                        additional troops may be required to achieve Soviet goals in Afghanistan.
                        Furthermore, the Soviets are believed to be willing to gradually commit
                        these forces during the coming months.</p>
                    <p>(S) We do not believe that the Soviets can initiate and sustain a full-scale
                        invasion of Pakistan with the force structure currently in Afghanistan, or
                        with the projected force structure which may be committed there within the
                        next 3 to 4 months. Nor do we believe that the Soviets would consider
                        initiating such an attack until they have better secured their control in
                        Afghanistan. Furthermore, a major Soviet invasion of Pakistan would require
                        the movement into Afghanistan from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> of a much more substantial combat force than is presently
                        near the Soviet-Afghan border. A considerable logistic buildup would also be
                        required to support this force. Nevertheless, limited Soviet ground force
                        cross-border incursions or “hot pursuit” strafing, bombing, or artillery
                        bombardment of “Patriot” sanctuaries in Pakistan are possible during the
                        next 3 to 4 months.</p>
                    <p>(S) The current and projected level of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan does
                        not preclude a concurrent military move against Iran. Sufficient forces are
                        available in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> near the Iranian
                        border to execute either a limited attack, such as the seizure of
                        Azerbaijan, or a large-scale invasion to seize most or all of Iran.</p>
                    <p><pb n="670" facs="0715" xml:id="pg_670"/>(S) We do not believe that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s current and projected level of
                        military involvement in Afghanistan significantly degrades its ability to
                        initiate direct, simultaneous military actions elsewhere. For example,
                        presently only 5 of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s 173 ground
                        divisions have been committed directly in support of Soviet operations in
                        Afghanistan. Although there has been some minor siphoning off of troops and
                        equipment from areas not contiguous to Afghanistan, the Soviet force
                        structure opposite <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, Yugoslavia, and
                        China remains essentially intact and for the most part unaffected by the
                        military incursion into Afghanistan. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s military presence in Afghanistan has
                        not affected the capabilities of the military forces of other Warsaw Pact
                        nations.</p>

                    <p>The Afghan insurgents have been relatively successful in avoiding the Soviet
                        offensive in eastern Afghanistan over the past month. While <pb n="671" facs="0716" xml:id="pg_671"/>casualties have been high, many insurgents
                        have been able to escape over the border into Pakistan or to fade into the
                        rugged, mountainous terrain. From there, they have mounted successful
                        guerrilla operations aimed at isolated Soviet or Afghan units, lines of
                        communications, and districts not heavily defended by Soviet or Afghan Army
                        forces. In other parts of the country, insurgent activity continues at a
                        high level, and little of the countryside is under government control. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The nationalists’ ability to sustain such operations will depend on the
                        continued availability of weapons and ammunition. Needs for equipment vary
                        widely throughout the country, often depending on the Soviets’ ability to
                        disrupt supply links across the Afghan border and on the strength of the
                        Afghan or Soviet forces in the area. Nationalists in the southwestern
                        provinces, who for the most part face undermanned Afghan army and police
                        units, are said to have enough weapons but are short of ammunition. In
                        contrast, in Konarha Province, where insurgents have faced a Soviet assault,
                        they reportedly do not have enough weapons, and those that they do have
                        often have proved ineffective against tanks and assault helicopters. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>So far, the insurgents have obtained the bulk of their weapons—mostly rifles,
                        mortars, machine guns, and occasionally tanks and armored personnel
                        carriers—from retreating or deserting Afghan troops and by ambushing supply
                        convoys. They also obtain weapons through the local arms market in western
                        Pakistan, where they purchase locally manufactured or imported weapons and
                        arms stolen from the Afghan or Pakistani armies. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Afghan soldiers still with their units have been a continuing source of
                        material, particularly ammunition. Soldiers regularly cache part of their
                        allotment of ammunition and sell it to the insurgents for cash; the Afghan
                        Army has long had difficulty paying its soldiers on time. Local government
                        officials have struck bargains with nationalist groups, providing food,
                        medicine, and other supplies as well as freedom of movement through
                        government checkpoints in exchange for protection for their families. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>The insurgents also receive small amounts of arms from a variety of outside
                        sources, but so far this aid has had a minimal impact on the capabilities of
                        the nationalist forces. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Pakistan</hi> has probably provided the most aid so far,
                        although we have little information on the types or amount of equipment it

                        additional aid if the exile groups form a viable, united resistance effort,

                        already demonstrated above-average leadership and fighting abilities. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>The insurgents almost certainly will continue to try to avoid pitched battles
                        with Soviet or Afghan government forces. They have not been deterred by the
                        Soviets, however, and if anything the insurgency may be more pervasive than
                        at any time since it began. In order to achieve a measure of success against
                        any large-scale Soviet assault they require a continuing supply of weapons,
                        mines, and ammunition. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] the single most effective Soviet weapon has been the
                        MI–24 helicopter, and few Afghans have weapons to combat them. A shortage of
                        antitank weapons has also hampered nationalist operations. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>To this end, the insurgents would appear to benefit most from the
                        introduction of man-portable, easy-to-operate weapons such as the Soviet
                        SA–7 or the US REDEYE surface-to-air missile, heavy machine guns, antitank
                        weapons such as the French MILAN or the US <gloss target="#t_LAW_1">LAW</gloss>, and nonmetallic antitank mines. Coordination of insurgent
                        assaults could be improved with the delivery of additional communications
                        equipment; some insurgent groups have set up effective tactical nets when
                        they have had the equipment. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and

                        CONTROL</hi></p>
                    <p>Three months after coming to power, the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> regime has failed to win significant support from the
                        people of Afghanistan. Soviet military tactics, though often brutal, have
                        failed to discourage popular resistance. Even the introduction of additional
                        Soviet forces may not assure suppression of the resistance during the spring
                        and summer months.</p>
                    <p>Signs of coup plotting against <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> and his Parchamist faction have recently reappeared in
                        both clandestine reporting and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] messages. These indications of a continued
                        intra-party struggle between the Khalq and Parcham factions reconfirm the
                        instability of the Babrak government, as do further military and police
                        defections. Information that Soviet advisors have attended conspiratorial
                        meetings indicates that they may be reassessing the viability of the Parcham
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>The constant barrage of government propaganda does not appear to have won
                        converts. The armed resistance to the Kabul government and the Soviet
                        invaders has grown significantly since December 27, as previously passive
                        onlookers throughout the country have been won over to the Mujahedin rebel
                        cause. Increasing supplies of weapons and ammunition from cross-border
                        support organizations may partly account for the escalated nationalist
                        activity in many areas. Participation by experienced Afghan army defectors
                        bringing weapons with them has also strengthened the resistance
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>Although Soviet forces are now deployed throughout much of the country, the
                        government, which for some time has had little authority in the central
                        Hazarajat region, is on the verge of losing control in several more
                        provinces. Soviet military engagements have failed to <pb n="674" facs="0719" xml:id="pg_674"/>produce decisive victories, with the
                        possible exception of Kabul, where severe repression of demonstrations in
                        February appears to have discouraged further anti-government activities. The
                        massive offensive in Konarha province retook one military outpost,
                        temporarily relieved the insurgent siege of another, destroyed many villages
                        and sent thousands of refugees into Pakistan. But the Soviets suffered
                        significant casualties in the process and reportedly continue to do so as
                        the rebels have again assumed the offensive in that region.</p>
                    <p>Both Soviets and Mujahedin hope to profit, although in different ways, from
                        increased mobility in the spring and summer. The Soviets will be able to
                        move heavy equipment into areas previously blocked by winter snows, while
                        the nationalists will be able to disperse higher up into the mountains.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets clearly have the advantage of far superior fire power and the
                        dreaded MI–24 helicopters. However, they are spread thin and reportedly
                        suffer from at best indifferent morale and discipline. The nationalists, who
                        can blend into a supportive population, appear to have excellent morale and
                        are dedicated to their cause. Thus, the months immediately ahead promise
                        serious fighting, much suffering for the population, and a continued flow of
                        cross-border refugees.</p>

                    <p rend="center">PREFACE</p>
                    <p>The opposition to the Soviet-backed government of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> in Afghanistan currently comprises three
                        political elements. The most active is the disorganized collection of
                        independent Afghan tribes currently waging vigorous guerrilla warfare
                        against occupying Soviet troops and their Afghan clients. A second element
                        is the royal family, headed by former King (1933–73) <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir Shah</persName>, who lives in exile in Rome.
                        The third force, and probably the most potentially significant, is a group
                        of six religious leaders, each heading an opposition party based in
                        Peshawar, Pakistan. Collectively they enjoy a wide following among their
                        countrymen, including many of the Afghan refugees in <pb n="676" facs="0721" xml:id="pg_676"/>Pakistan and a significant number of the fighting
                        tribesmen. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In the past these six exile leaders have never been able to set aside their
                        deep personal and ideological differences in order to unite into a more
                        forceful opposition against the pro-Communist government in Kabul. Attempts
                        at unification in April 1978 and August 1979 foundered after only a few
                        weeks. A third attempt was initiated in January 1980, when the six leaders
                        united under the banner of the Islamic Alliance for the Liberation of
                        Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss>). This attempt at unity
                        has an important distinction from previous tries; it incorporates a direct
                        agreement between two significant exile figures—<persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Sayed Ahmad Gailani</persName> and Sebqatullah Mojadedi—who had
                        hitherto been unable to set aside for very long the historical rivalry of
                        their respective families. This try at unity has also been the first since
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. As a consequence of
                        that act, the <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss> has come under
                        increased pressure from the Governments of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other
                        Persian Gulf states to keep itself united as a precondition for military and
                        financial aid. In March 1980, in response to this pressure, the <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss> selected a figurehead leader, Abdul
                        Rasul Saif. Imprisoned for the past five years, Saif, unlike the six other
                        exile leaders in Peshawar, is not known to have any political or religious
                        following. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Despite these efforts, the potential for disintegration remains. The <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss> was formed in haste to achieve a
                        semblance of unity before the 26 January Islamic Foreign Ministers
                        Conference in Islamabad, so the six leaders had to postpone negotiating any
                        organizational details. The charter was drawn up by Mojadedi and <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName>; under it Mojadedi will be prime
                        minister (head of government) in a government-in-exile or any future
                        post-Communist government, while <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> will act as chief of a revolutionary council (chief
                        of state). Another council, composed primarily of tribal leaders, is to
                        elect other government officials. The leaders have not yet all agreed to the
                        specifics of the charter. In fact, Gulbuddin Hikmatyar has withdrawn his
                        Islamic Party from the <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss>—at least
                        temporarily—because he believes that it will have too small a representation
                        on the revolutionary council. He was demanded a system of proportional
                        representation that will reflect the number of guerrillas that each alliance
                        group has fielded. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss>, the
                        Tribesmen, and the King</p>
                    <p>The view the embattled tribal leaders have of the <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss> probably varies from individual to individual. Some no
                        doubt look to it for political coordination of their opposition to the
                        pro-Soviet government and as the channel for external military assistance.
                        Others are most <pb n="677" facs="0722" xml:id="pg_677"/>likely indifferent
                        to its existence and are content to struggle independently. In any case,
                        most tribesmen are discontent with the internal squabbling that depletes so
                        much of the exile leaders’ energies and that reduces their effectiveness as
                        a conduit of external aid. The tribesmen also perceive that the exile
                        parties are playing a minor role in the actual insurgency. As a consequence
                        the tribesmen want a greater role for themselves in Peshawar politics so as
                        to obtain a greater share of the arms they think are coming into the area
                        from the outside and to influence the nature of a successor government. Many
                        of the tribal leaders have said that if the <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss> members do not make immediate progress in resolving their
                        differences, they will form an alliance of their own as the principal
                        political focus of resistance against the Communists. Participation of the
                        Peshawar-based leaders in such a tribal council would depend on the number
                        of seats each could win in an election among district representatives picked
                        by the tribesmen. Under such circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName>, who has the most religious influence among the
                        tribesmen, would have a good chance of being elected president of any
                        post-Communist government. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Some tribesmen support the return of the royal family, regarding it as the
                        last legitimate government of Afghanistan and possibly considering it as
                        having sufficient national stature to rally around in case the Peshawar
                        leaders and the tribesmen fail to develop their own unified opposition to
                        the Communist government. Neither King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir
                            Shah</persName> nor another important member of the royal family, the
                        King’s cousin and son-in-law Prince Abdul Wali, seem likely to gain enough
                        support to reestablish the monarchy, but they may still figure prominently
                        in any post-Communist government because of the respect they continue to
                        enjoy among some tribesmen in Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The return of the monarchy, however, is one of many issues on which the
                        Peshawar leaders differ. The role that Islam will play in a successor
                        government is another key sticking point, with the spectrum of views running
                        from those who favor a Western-style democratic form of government to those
                        who feel that the only constitution their country needs is the Koran. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan gave added impetus to growing concerns
                        among non-Communist East Asian states that the Soviets, together with
                        Vietnam, represent a serious long-term threat to regional security. It
                        brought new awareness to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                        ability and willingness to project its power beyond Soviet borders and
                        pointed up deficiencies in existing East Asian defense arrangements. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>All East Asian countries are now reassessing their defense and foreign
                        policies. They see the need for a strong US military presence in the region
                        but question the commitment and capability of the United States to project
                        its power overseas; thus they will avoid getting “out front” in opposing the
                        Soviets. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction
                            not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>East Asian countries do not agree on how to meet the more visible Soviet
                        threat. Many have important economic dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that they do not wish to jeopardize.
                        Some still believe China presents the main long-term danger. Relations with
                        nonaligned countries and commitments to Third World causes also influence
                        their decisions. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling
                            restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Japanese leaders now believe Japan must play a more active defense role and
                        that it must use its economic strength to further its international
                        political and security goals. Public attitudes will change more slowly, but
                        the evolution has begun. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>South Korea’s preoccupation with the possibility of a North Korean invasion
                        influences its view of international affairs. Seoul may believe that the
                        Afghanistan invasion and consequent exposure of Soviet <pb n="679" facs="0724" xml:id="pg_679"/>duplicity will intensify the US security
                        commitment to South Korea. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>Southeast Asian states see the need to strengthen their defenses but differ
                        about what course to take. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is
                        unlikely to become an explicit defense grouping in the near future, but
                        bilateral defense cooperation will increase among member states. More
                        cooperation with the United States on a bilateral and limited basis is also
                        likely. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction

                    <p>Australia and New Zealand recognize that their geographic location no longer
                        isolates them from the effects of Soviet- or Vietnamese-instigated
                        instability in East Asia. Budgetary restrictions and domestic political
                        inhibitions, however, constrain either country from major increases in
                        defense spending. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>US and Soviet actions in the coming months will largely determine whether the
                        changing perceptions of East Asian states evolve into lasting action. The
                        speed and effectiveness of US responses to East Asian security concerns will
                        condition attitudes about the United States as a durable and consistent
                        deterrent to Soviet expansionism. If Moscow refrains from further
                        provocative acts and embarks on a peace offensive, the fears of some
                        countries may recede. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Afghanistan invasion has opened the way for greater cooperation with US
                        security and other international policy objectives. Future US actions will
                        be the major determinant of whether this happens. Military assistance is an
                        important yardstick, but East Asian states will also measure the US response
                        by Washington’s willingness to provide political support and understanding
                        as well as economic aid and cooperation in matters they consider important.

                    <p>1. A short time ago we were discussing the implications of the Soviet move
                        into Afghanistan. We asked whether this was an aberration which, when behind
                        us, will see the Soviet Union revert to its previous pattern of behavior; or
                        whether it is a symptom of a new phase of adventuresome policy to which the
                        Kremlin is already committed.<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s analysis on this topic,
                            see <ref target="#d243">Document 243</ref>.</note> Subsequently, I asked
                        our Soviet experts to look at these two possible explanations for Soviet
                        behavior in Afghanistan. They have written the attached paper which I
                        believe is very helpful in putting these two explanations into perspective.
                            [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>2. It concludes that Soviet behavior in the future will be quite contingent
                        on the conclusions which the Soviet leadership draws from the results of
                        their experience in Afghanistan and US reactions to it. In short, the
                        Soviets are neither committed to returning to detente nor to pursuing an
                        aggressive policy on a global basis. [<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking and handling restriction not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>3. I would only add a personal comment that I would be a bit more categoric
                        than the paper in stating that the Soviet behavior in Afghanistan was not an
                        aberration. I agree that we do not have evidence that the Soviets are firmly
                        committed to continuing as aggressive a policy in the third world as was
                        this Afghan example. Yet, I do believe that the Soviet track record over the
                        past five or six years indicates a definitely greater willingness to probe
                        the limits of our tolerance. “Detente” was not a bar to their greater
                        assertiveness in Angola, Ethiopia, Kampuchea, and Yemen. It need not be so
                        again, even if we return to detente. As the paper concludes, how assertive
                        the Soviets will be <pb n="681" facs="0726" xml:id="pg_681"/>in the future
                        will very likely depend upon how “successful” the Soviet leadership views
                        their intervention in Afghanistan to have been. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                        </list>
                        <p>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has precipitated a sharp debate over
                            its significance. On one side, some offer Afghan-specific explanations
                            to argue that the move is an episodic aberration in an otherwise
                            generally circumspect pattern of Soviet behavior. On the other side of
                            the debate are those who hold that the invasion represents the opening
                            of a new and more aggressive phase in what promises to be an escalating
                            global competition.</p>
                        <p>Proponents of the first view concede that the invasion represents
                            Moscow’s first postwar use of combat forces outside the Soviet Bloc. But
                            they emphasize Afghanistan’s status as a Soviet client and ally and
                            suggest that the invasion was the result of a reluctant decision by
                            Moscow that it could not permit the collapse of a proto-socialist allied
                            regime in a neighboring country which was an incipient bastion of
                            anti-Communist Islamic fundamentalism, if not a potential client of the
                            US or the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Proponents of the second view contend that the invasion is symptomatic of
                            Moscow’s growing willingness to play a worldwide interventionist role
                            and to resort to the direct use of Soviet military force in the pursuit
                            of otherwise unattainable ambitions. As these analysts see it, Moscow is
                            convinced that “the correlation of forces” has shifted to its side,
                            creating a situation in which actions that it would previously have
                            rejected as “adventuristic” can now be confidently undertaken. Some
                            analysts of this persuasion even argue that Moscow’s new found
                            confidence has led it to embark on a calculated plan to fill the
                                unprece<pb n="682" facs="0727" xml:id="pg_682"/>dented vacuum of
                            power in Southwest Asia and consolidate a position of privileged access
                            to Middle Eastern oil and control over oil supply routes. In this way,
                            the Soviet Union would be assured of a solution to its own emergent
                            energy problem, and also win immense leverage against the West—leverage
                            which, among other things, Moscow could utilize to forestall the sort of
                            Western military buildup which could redress the currently favorable
                            “correlation of forces”.</p>
                        <p>Rather different policy implications flow from these alternative
                            explanations and expectations of Soviet behavior. The first implies that
                            if the Soviet Union can be induced to withdraw from Afghanistan in
                            return for suitable “reassurances” it will revert to a more acceptable
                            pattern of behavior and may even show a heightened appreciation of the
                            value (and fragility) of “detente”. According to this view, the present
                            Soviet predicament is in large part the product of miscalculation which
                            is now recognized as such. This has led to a situation in which the
                            mutual interests of the West and the Soviet Union lie in fashioning a
                            face-saving solution which will permit the resumption of normal
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The second view holds that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain a
                            permanent military presence in Afghanistan and will use it to bolster
                            its geopolitical position in the region, to bring pressure to bear on
                            neighboring and nearby countries, to discredit or nullify Western
                            security guarantees, and to highlight Western weakness and irresolution.
                            With reference to detente, this view holds that the Soviets are prepared
                            to write off for the time being what they already perceived before
                            Afghanistan as unsatisfactory levels of US trade, credits and technology
                            transfers. Simultaneously, Moscow will seek to preserve and extend its
                            commercial relations with Western Europe, and Japan through what it
                            believes can be a successful policy of “differentiated detente”.</p>
                        <p>The relevance of the central and regional military balances for the
                            Soviet decision to intervene in Afghanistan is also at issue in these
                            contrasting views of Soviet behavior. Members of the aberrationist
                            school are inclined to believe that shifts in the military balance over
                            the course of the last ten to fifteen years were essentially irrelevant
                            with respect to the Afghanistan intervention. Given the identical set of
                            circumstances, they contend, the Soviets would have intervened in
                            Afghanistan ten or fifteen years ago, as they did in Hungary in 1956. In
                            contrast, those who view the invasion as reflecting a higher Soviet
                            propensity to take risks hold that it was precisely the shift in the
                            military balances of the past ten to fifteen years that emboldened the
                            Soviets for the first time to employ military force directly against a
                            non-bloc state. As these analysts see it, the shifting strategic balance
                            has created a military environment in which Soviet recourse to force
                            became both physically possible and politically attractive.</p>
                        <p><pb n="683" facs="0728" xml:id="pg_683"/>We believe that each of these
                            divergent viewpoints captures important aspects of reality, but that
                            each also omits important considerations. If taken alone, each has
                            potentially misleading policy implications. Like those who view the
                            intervention as an aberration, we believe it was triggered by
                            Afghan-specific events and did not in itself stem from or reflect a
                            conviction that the time was ripe for a global offensive, let alone from
                            a belief that it was a necessary (or even a very sensible) first step in
                            the pursuit of warm water ports or control of Middle Eastern oil. Like
                            the aberrationists, we also believe that the timing of the Soviet
                            decision to intervene was critically affected by fear of an imminent,
                            and possibly irreversible, disintegration of the established Kabul
                            regime and its replacement by a regime which might even prove
                            susceptible to hostile external influence. In addition, we share the
                            aberrationists’ belief that the invasion of Afghanistan was defensive in
                            the sense that it was motivated by fear that the loss of a country from
                            within the Soviet sphere of influence would have an extremely adverse
                            effect on Moscow’s credibility as a power determined to brook no
                            challenge to the integrity of its empire or to the irreversibility of
                            “socialist” gains.</p>
                        <p>We are also inclined to agree with some of the arguments of those who see
                            the invasion as an expression of a more fundamental shift in global
                            Soviet policy. We believe it is probably the Soviet perception that
                            their enhanced military posture, especially in the strategic area, has
                            created a more permissive political environment for the conduct of
                            foreign policy. It has lowered the perceived risk of Soviet exploitation
                            of political and social instability in the Third World, and of a more
                            assertive foreign policy that has included the use of military force,
                            either directly or through proxies, in some Third World countries.
                            Growing Soviet military aid efforts have served as the main conveyor of
                            Soviet influence—in Angola, Ethiopia, Yemen, etc. The calculations that
                            informed the invasion of Afghanistan, therefore, were not without
                            precedent. Afghanistan involved the crossing of an important threshold,
                            and was recognized as such by the Soviet leadership. But, as we have
                            also pointed out, it was preceded by a gradual, decade-long escalation
                            in Soviet political-military involvement in the Third World.</p>
                        <p>The decision to solve the Afghanistan problem by an unprecedented massive
                            military intervention in a “Third World” country is a culmination of
                            this process. It reflects a confidence that the shift in the global
                            military balance, as the Soviets perceive it, guaranteed the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> immunity from Western military
                            retaliation, and has created new possibilities to demonstrate the
                            apparent inability of the West to deter Soviet self-assertiveness. The
                            possibility that Afghanistan represents a qualitative turn in Soviet
                            foreign policy in the region and toward the Third World is one to be
                            taken seriously. The Soviets recognize that the issue <pb n="684" facs="0729" xml:id="pg_684"/>of super-power involvement in a region
                            that stretches from Morocco to the Indian subcontinent remains the vital
                            question informing the posture and policies of the nations in the
                            region.</p>
                        <p>On balance, we tend to disagree with the argument that ascribes the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s Third World involvement and
                            its involvement in Afghanistan largely to Soviet feelings of insecurity.
                            We would argue that such behavior is more the product of confidence in a
                            potentially enduring shift in the balance of power—a stronger sense of
                            being a superpower and being perceived by others as such. This status
                            and self-image has become an important determinant of Soviet behavior; a
                            superpower would not let an “allied” regime in a bordering country go
                            down the drain. At the same time, from the Soviet point of view,
                            Afghanistan probably appeared an extremely low risk venture precisely
                            because it was preceded by numerous ventures which, though they did not
                            involve the direct use of large-scale Soviet forces, did involve an
                            active Soviet military presence in countries remote from the borders of
                            the Soviet Union, and located well within traditional Western spheres of
                            influence. The Soviet ability to carry out these ventures without
                            incurring drastic costs enhanced Moscow’s confidence that it could
                            intervene with relative impunity in Afghanistan. Perhaps to Moscow’s
                            surprise, this intervention did finally precipitate the sort of Western
                            reaction that the Kremlin may well have feared, but tended to discount
                            in view of the relatively passive reaction to its earlier involvements
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Even if those who see the invasion as an aberration were completely
                            correct in their explanation, there would be grounds for skepticism
                            about the policy implications they often tend to draw: namely, that if
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> can terminate its Afghan
                            adventure in relatively short order and without an undue loss of face,
                            it is unlikely to try to expand its influence elsewhere in Southwest
                            Asia or to challenge Western Third World interests militarily. However,
                            unlike the symptomists, we do not take it to be an almost foregone
                            conclusion that the invasion of Afghanistan will be followed by
                            comparable acts of Soviet military self-assertiveness. Like the
                            aberrationists, we consider it possible that the termination of the
                            Afghan adventure will leave the Soviet Union willing and eager to resume
                            the process of detente. However, as was true before the invasion, the
                            Soviets will continue to interpret detente as permitting active military
                            and quasi-military challenges to Western Third World interests.</p>
                        <p>The real issue of this discussion—whether the Afghanistan invasion
                            represents an aberration or a trend in Soviet policy—is the degree of
                            restraint which has governed Soviet policy toward opportunities in the
                            Third World, the nature and sources of that restraint, and changes in
                            it. Some would acknowledge that while Soviet policies since the
                            mid-1970’s have been more assertive and probing, such policies also <pb n="685" facs="0730" xml:id="pg_685"/>reflect caution and
                            risk-avoidance, imposed in part by Moscow’s desire to preserve its
                            detente and arms control relationships with the US. While a combination
                            of these motives contributed to the Soviet decision to invade, one can
                            only explain that decision in the broader context of Soviet perceptions
                            of a more favorable global military position and a greater latitude for
                            risk. If one subscribes to the idea that the Soviet propensity to take
                            risks is higher, however, one must realize that an ongoing cost-benefit
                            analysis will continue to shape Moscow’s policies toward the Third
                            World.</p>
                        <p>While we disagree with those who argue that the Soviets are henceforth
                            irrevocably committed to the direct use of their own military force to
                            aggrandize power in the Third World, we agree with them that Afghanistan
                            could be a precedent if the Soviets conclude it was an appropriate
                            solution to the Afghan problem, if they perceive that it places them in
                            a position from which they can exert pervasive leverage in Southwest
                            Asia, and if they conclude that the West is either incapable or
                            unwilling to frustrate the effort or to oblige the Soviet Union to pay a
                            counterbalancing military or political price elsewhere. In short, the
                            answer to the question of whether or not Afghanistan is a harbinger of
                            things to come will depend importantly on the “lessons” that are drawn
                            from the Afghan experience by the present incumbents in the Kremlin and
                            the successors who will shortly replace them.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we believe that Afghanistan is neither an aberration which, when
                            behind us, will see the Soviet Union revert to its previous pattern of
                            behavior, nor a symptom of a new phase of adventuresome policy to which
                            the Kremlin is already committed. We believe that future Soviet behavior
                            will be more contingent, the result of conclusions the Soviet leadership
                            reaches after an analysis of the costs and benefits of the invasion. A
                            generally assertive Soviet policy will almost certainly continue, but
                            whether it is more constrained in use of military force or not will
                            depend importantly on the “lessons of Afghanistan”: the outcome of the
                            situation in that country, its impact on the region, and on US allies,
                            but, above all, on Soviet perceptions of US reactions.</p>

                            United States could maintain a diplomatic presence in Kabul while
                            avoiding contact with the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>
                            government. The Department stated that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy on this matter should be coordinated with its
                            allies. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                    <p>2. We share Department’s concern as expressed in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> about how long we can continue to avoid diplomatic
                        contact with the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> regime
                        and still expect to function as a diplomatic mission in Kabul. We have
                        already seen the kinds of pressure the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>
                        can apply to “encourage” us to move towards more normal diplomatic
                        relations: when we were unsuccessfully seeking consular access to two
                        imprisoned Americans we were told that “something might be done” if we took
                        it up at the political level; and we and other Embassies which refrain from
                        diplomatic dealings with the regime are being subjected to a more
                        restrictive visa policy than “friendly” countries, and this could impact on
                        our operations here.<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">In telegram 1103 from
                            Kabul, March 24, the Embassy described the arrest and detention of

                            rug buyer who was detained by Afghan police for alleged suspicious
                            activity. The Embassy advised Brockunier to leave Afghanistan
                            immediately because, as a private citizen, it could offer him no
                            protection. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                    <p>3. We have been discussing this problem with selected diplomatic colleagues
                        and on April 13, after a false start or two, I got the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, French, Italian, German and Japanese
                        Chargés together for lunch to discuss it as a group. While everyone agreed
                        that we are on thin ice here, all seemed to have different (and not very
                        well thought out) notions of what we might be able to do to improve the
                        situation. All are under general instructions to refrain from diplomatic
                        contacts with the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. However, except for
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> Chargé, they are unwilling to
                        exercise the slightest initiative in interpreting that instruction without
                        referring back to their capitals. (The four <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Chargés have been meeting <pb n="687" facs="0732" xml:id="pg_687"/>regularly twice a week to coordinate their activities
                        in accordance with instructions from home, and some of them resent it if one
                        of their number does something out of step with the others; see Kabul

                        regular monthly meetings like Sunday’s will have some value in keeping one
                        another informed of current thinking on these matters in our capitals and in
                        coordinating our tactics locally to the extent allowed by national policies
                        but will be of very little use in coming up with innovative ideas to help
                        shape those policies. These meetings could be useful in reinforcing <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy proposals which are also made in
                        the respective capitals or to the Embassies in Washington, but my guess is
                        that not much would come of trying to use the Kabul Chargés as a means of
                        channeling <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> suggestions to their
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>4. The following summarizes the personal views of those at Sunday’s meeting
                        on how we can best maintain our diplomatic presence in Kabul without
                        undercutting our policy of nonrecognition and the avoidance of diplomatic
                        contact. (Please protect the Chargés in any discussions with other
                        governments.) The British Chargé believes that eventually, and probably
                        sooner rather than later, we will have to expand our contacts with the
                        regime somewhat beyond the current administrative and consular areas if we
                        are to protect our interests here. He believes this can be done in an
                        incremental, non-dramatic way and that if necessary enough disclaimers can
                        be built in to assure there is no implication that we “recognize” or approve
                        of the regime. The German, on the other hand, believes we ought not to
                        increase our dealings with the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> but wait
                        the situation out. He thinks we should be able to find ways to reciprocate
                        and make our displeasure known if the regime does something we can’t put up
                        with, but he wasn’t able to suggest specific measures when various
                        situations were posed. The French Chargé felt it was important not to do
                        anything to jeopardize future good relations while waiting for the “very
                        awkward” political situation to get better. (Most of the French Embassy
                        staff here, the largest of any non-Communist country, is concerned with
                        maintaining and improving cultural ties with France.) The Italian tended to
                        agree with the British Chargé, while the Japanese didn’t offer an
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>5. My own view is that for the time being, at least, we can live with the
                        present arrangement in spite of the difficulties we may increasingly face in
                        our day-to-day operations and that it is probably worthwhile doing so for
                        the sake of our overall objectives. (Not everyone in the Embassy agrees;
                        some believe, as the British Chargé does, that if <pb n="688" facs="0733" xml:id="pg_688"/>we want to continue functioning here we are going to
                        have to offer something to the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> in
                        return.) In my opinion, the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> and the
                        Soviets need us here so they can continue to maintain that everything has
                        returned to normal in Afghanistan (and the Afghans may also consider our
                        presence a potentially useful hedge against total dependence on the
                        Soviets), but they want us here on their own conditions or as close to them
                        as they can get. They want a very small Embassy so we have a limited
                        capability to do the things they know we are trying to do; they want to make
                        it difficult for us to rotate <gloss target="#t_TDY_1">TDY</gloss> personnel
                        in and out of Kabul because that increases their problems of surveillance
                        and control; and they want to put obstacles in our way so they can trade the
                        removal of those obstacles for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        concessions. But they do not want to push us so far that we pack up and
                        leave, and we can use that knowledge to defend ourselves against their
                        moves. While the Afghans are unpredictable and often illogical, they have
                        shown that they understand and respond to firm counterpressure (witness
                        their back-down when the Pakistani Chargé threatened reciprocal action on
                        visas), and we should not be afraid to play tit-for-tat with them. Where
                        there is no exactly reciprocal action we can take, as there is in the visa
                        field, we should be able to find something else that hurts about as much.
                        Our hole card is the threat to close down our Embassy and encourage others
                        to leave as well, demonstrating to the world that claims of normalcy and
                        legitimacy are pure hogwash. It goes without saying that we should not
                        threaten this action unless we can afford to go through with it, and that is
                        a judgment I cannot make from here. But if, as I believe, the Afghans need
                        us here more than we need to be here, toughing it out is probably our best
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>Since their invasion in December, the Soviets have encountered more
                        resistance and instability in Afghanistan than they anticipated. Yet,
                        despite several thousand Soviet casualties and continued international
                        criticism, there are no indications that Moscow is seriously considering any
                        change in its basic policy of preserving a pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. Its
                        words and actions suggest that it hopes to ride out the present difficult
                        situation, slowly—very slowly—rebuild the Afghan army and government, and
                        avoid being forced to commit still larger numbers of Soviet forces to
                        achieve its aim.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Insurgency Continues, Regime Shaky</p>
                    <p>Three months after the Soviet-engineered coup that brought it to power, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> regime has still
                        been unable to garner significant popular support and remains in power only
                        because of the presence of Soviet troops. The insurgents continue to
                        threaten major urban areas, while constantly ambushing and engaging Soviet
                        and Afghan troops in the countryside. Within the government itself, there
                        remains a bitter Khalqi-Parchamist rivalry, and recently, new rumors of coup
                        plotting have surfaced. Internationally, the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> regime has failed to win any important
                        recognition outside of the Soviet bloc and its hangers-on.</p>
                    <p>Although the rebels cannot stand up to concerted Soviet military strikes,
                        their hit-and-run tactics have thus far made any Soviet gains temporary.
                        Soviet forces can pacify an area or province, but once withdrawn, the rebels
                        return. While the Soviets have been able to restore a semblance of order in
                        Kabul after last February’s riots and general strike, they have only been
                        able to do so by assuming more and more of the security burden
                            themselves.<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document

                        necessitated by the continued disintegration of the Afghan forces. The
                        Afghan army currently has little more than 30,000 men; it is questionable
                        whether it could field more than 10,000 at any one time. Soviet military
                        officials in Afghanistan have reportedly complained about the Afghan army’s
                        disarray and have expressed grave doubts about its loyalty.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">No Change in Sight</p>
                    <p>The current situation in Afghanistan—and the likelihood that it will continue
                        for some time—raises the question of whether the Soviets are approaching the
                        point at which they will have to decide to increase substantially their
                        military commitment in order to eradicate the insurgency once and for all or
                        pursue some sort of political solution that would allow them to extricate
                        themselves from what is quickly becoming the Afghan quagmire. While there
                        are indications that at least individual officials in the Soviet ministry of
                        foreign affairs and military have grave doubts about the wisdom of the
                        present Soviet course, there are no signs that Moscow is now seriously
                        rethinking its policy. Indeed, the present situation in Afghanistan may well
                        have confirmed the Soviet leadership in the wisdom of its decision to
                        intervene in the first place on the grounds that if the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had not, the situation would be far
                        worse.</p>
                    <p>Despite Moscow’s insistence that it is in favor of a political solution to
                        the Afghan problem, the Soviets have rebuffed any initiatives requiring
                        compromises on their part and have meanwhile stiffened their own maximalist
                        position. In discussions in March with the French and British, for example,
                        the Soviets insisted that the US and Afghanistan’s neighbors must
                        “guarantee” that all outside interference in Afghanistan has ceased, and
                        would not resume, before Moscow would even consider withdrawing its troops.
                        Lately, they hinted that any solution must include the entire region and
                        that “guarantees” of non-intervention must also include Iran.</p>
                    <p>Over the last two months, the Soviets have made it clear that the Afghan
                        Marxist revolution is an historical fact and must be preserved and
                        protected. Their public support for the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> regime as the only legitimate government of
                        Afghanistan has been complete, though rumors abound that they are seeking a
                        more effective Afghan puppet than Babrak. In reply to Western and Iranian
                        proposals to discuss the “neutralization” of Afghanistan, Moscow has
                        insisted that neither the “socialist” nature of the Afghan government nor
                        its international status can be open for outsiders to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the Soviets are attempting to portray the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> regime as the effective government
                        if Afghanistan capable of carrying <pb n="691" facs="0736" xml:id="pg_691"/>out its international obligations, in a perfectly normal manner. In early
                        April, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> agreed to a $150 million
                        economic grant for Kabul, and appears to be encouraging the East Europeans
                        to help alleviate the dismal Afghan economic situation and to give the
                        illusion at least of socialist solidarity. Soviet propaganda has extolled
                        the reforms of the Kabul regime and attempted to portray the rebels as,
                        “bandits” controlled by reactionary mullahs and egged on by outside
                        “imperialist” provocateurs. Hardly a week has gone by in which the Soviet
                        media have not highlighted the visit of an Afghan delegation or senior
                        official to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or Eastern Europe.
                        Similarly, the Soviets have given favorable play to the Cuban foreign
                        minister’s recent trip to Afghanistan and have used the occasion to
                        re-emphasize Kabul’s nonalignment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Hopes</p>
                    <p>Although they underestimated the intensity of international and Islamic
                        criticism, the Soviets certainly anticipated some trouble. However, they
                        apparently expected it to be short-lived and no greater in duration and
                        severity than after Czechoslovakia in 1968. In this they were wrong. But
                        they may be heartened by signs of obvious differences in tactical approach
                        between the US, the West Europeans, and Japan on issues of current
                        political, cultural, and economic relationships with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Moscow is still probably counting on
                        the stake of America’s allies in detente in Europe to lead them to accept
                        the intervention as a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the regional response to the Soviet action, Moscow may also
                        believe it has seen the worst. Relations with Iran appear no worse than they
                        would have been if there had been no invasion, and, in any case, US-Iranian
                        relations remain in shambles. Similarly, Pakistan has yet to embrace openly
                        the rebel cause and is hesitating to align itself with the US. Moscow
                        probably believes that this is a result of its policy of playing on
                        Islamabad’s fear of Soviet retribution while offering reassurances and
                        increased aid. Moscow probably also judges that the damage to its relations
                        with India has been negligible because of New Delhi’s concern over increased
                        US aid to Pakistan and its suspicions of China. Further afield, the Soviets
                        are probably still calculating that they can eventually refocus Arab
                        attention away from Afghanistan to the Palestinian and Iranian problems and,
                        thus, on the US.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Commitment Remains</p>
                    <p>In any case, Moscow is not backing away from its military commitment in
                        Afghanistan. During Afghan Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_DSM_1">Dost</persName>’s visit to Moscow in March, the Afghans and Soviets
                        signed an agreement on the stationing of forces which provides for the
                        “temporary” presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. Presumably, this
                        agreement is similar <pb n="692" facs="0737" xml:id="pg_692"/>to those which
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has with Warsaw Pact countries.
                        The Soviets have also proceeded with the construction of permanent barracks
                        and garrison areas and are reportedly restructuring some of their units in
                        Afghanistan in order to wage a more effective counterinsurgency
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>It can be expected that with the arrival of good weather, Soviets will step
                        up their operations against the rebels. Operations will probably be
                        concentrated in the eastern provinces where the insurgents have been most
                        active. Closing the border with Pakistan to rebel movements will surely be
                        one of the aims. While this offensive will result in considerable bloodshed
                        on both sides, it will probably not be decisive. The resistance may be
                        forced to subside momentarily to regain its breath, but its almost certain
                        revival will continue the attrition of Soviet forces in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Limiting the Cost</p>
                    <p>The Soviets seem prepared to shoulder the Afghan burden for some time to
                        come, but there are signs that they hope to accomplish their goals without
                        significantly augmenting their forces. Since late February, Soviet troop
                        levels have not greatly increased and now number 85,000 in Afghanistan and
                        another 30,000 involved in the intervention, but held just across the border
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. While they will probably
                        augment these slowly over the next month or so, there are no indications
                        they plan a massive increase. Unless the Soviets dramatically increase these
                        forces—which they may have to consider if operations this spring and early
                        summer falter badly—they remain unlikely to crush the insurgency quickly.
                        However, for now, they seem in no hurry and appear to prefer to test their
                        capability to do the job with their present forces for a full campaign
                        season. Their current game plan for stabilizing the situation includes the
                        start of a long-term effort to rebuild the Afghan armed forces, as well as
                        limited combat engagements for Soviet troops which are enough to hold the
                        major cities and to prevent general deterioration.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> to clarify
                        what was indeed the Soviet position on Afghanistan. <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Babrak Government
                        had a good proposal (publicly announced by the Afghanistan Government on
                        April 17).<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">On April 17, the Afghan Government
                            announced its intention to attempt to normalize relations with Iran and
                            Pakistan. News reports quoted unnamed Western diplomats who
                            characterized the move as a Soviet-directed attempt to mitigate the
                            international boycott of the Soviet-hosted Olympics and to dampen
                            worldwide condemnation of Soviet policies in Afghanistan. See Kevin
                            Klose, “Afghanistan Seeks to Open Talks to Mend Ties with Iran,
                            Pakistan,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, April 18, 1980, p.
                            A26.</note> The first step would be a discussion among the three
                        neighboring countries—Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan—about their borders.
                        The Soviets supported that idea because, after all, there had been
                        historically much trouble about those borders. The decision could create a
                        peaceful atmosphere and if some countries wanted to guarantee the results
                        such as the Soviets, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or European
                        countries, the Soviets would be prepared for it. A second step would be to
                        enlarge the discussions leading to a pact of non-interference, disarmament,
                        etc., among the three neighbors, and of course there could be guarantees for
                        this as well. A third step, which seemed not likely to be acceptable, <pb n="694" facs="0739" xml:id="pg_694"/>might be to enlarge the discussions
                        and to talk about the military presence in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>Secretary pressed two questions—would the Soviets be willing to withdraw
                        their forces, and can the Afghanistanese choose their own government?
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> thought that the Soviet
                        forces would most naturally withdraw after the conclusion of Step I although
                        this might happen in the course of the discussions to Step II as well. (With
                        further questioning, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> on this
                        point was evasive.) He emphasized that border crossing on the
                        Pakistan-Afghanistan border was and is a large problem, but he thought that
                        once the border was agreed and sealed it would create a situation where the
                        Soviets could withdraw. He then turned to his proposal and urged, what was
                        wrong with discussing the Afghanistan idea? The Secretary responded that the
                        Afghanistan Government in no way represented the Afghanistan people, and
                        returned to his point asking, can the Afghanistanese choose their own
                        government? Babrak is no real representative. He pressed then the
                        question—does an Afghanistan Government have to be acceptable to the
                        Soviets? <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> responded that
                        obviously the Soviets did not want a hostile government, but otherwise were
                        quite open about the form of government. The Secretary responded then that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> was insisting on a
                        Soviet-installed government. <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        replied that, you say it so.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> gave a long comment on the
                        nature of Afghanistan, the social changes. He said that it is a land that
                        where for decades there has been fighting and discontent. This has been
                        particularly true in more recent years where the landlords’ holdings have
                        been exploited after centuries of depression. The Soviets he said had had
                        problems of a similar nature in the Asiatic areas of Russia, which had
                        continued right on through until 1930. There were similarities here—of race,
                        of peoples who move back and forth across borders, of the relationship
                        between peasants and landlords. Today in Afghanistan he recognized that
                        perhaps not many of the people are in favor of the Russians, but they are in
                        favor of the social changes in recent years. A real civil war is going on in
                        Afghanistan between the old and the new, and it is not all that simple to
                        define. If the main <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concern is that the
                        Soviets are pushing to the Ocean, the Soviets could settle this by giving
                        guarantees because they don’t have that objective. If it is a question of
                        borders and the future of Pakistan, then why not have it talked out along
                        the lines of the Babrak proposal?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said of our concerns that Pakistan was a buffer state and we
                        could live with it, but now it is not, and the Soviets have 85,000 troops
                            there.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">An unknown hand bracketed “Pakistan,”

                        the Indian Ocean and we cannot be certain of what are the Soviet intentions.
                        Would the Soviets accept a non-aligned government in Afghanistan? <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said yes, but it must not be
                        hostile to the Soviets. The Secretary again questioned, do you accept the
                        concept of a buffer state in Afghanistan? <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said yes, but remember that over the past 15 years
                        there have been changes in the social structure and land reforms so that a
                        buffer state would not be simply a reversion to the period of Daoud. The
                        Secretary asked whether the 3-step proposal of <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> had to take place step by step, or if some could
                        take place at the same time. <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        replied that it is probably simpler to proceed step by step, but there was
                        no objection to a mixture. Sticking to his primary point, he repeated that
                        the Afghanistanese are interested in the first step and the Soviets
                        therefore support him.</p>

                            troops from Afghanistan is a precondition for any improvement in its
                            relations with either country. Islamabad’s position is under constant
                            review, however, and President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> is subject to conflicting pressures from within his

                        problems Pakistan faces in the short term as the Soviets try to pacify
                        Afghanistan. Some advisers believe that a continued influx of refugees could
                        soon lead to a serious breakdown of law and order along the frontier. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                        acquiescence in a violation of their country’s sovereignty. The Pakistanis
                        believe that the Soviets are already encouraging leftists as well as
                        separatists, especially in Baluchistan, to oppose <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> more actively. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Diplomatic Tightrope</p>
                    <p>Islamabad has taken a strong diplomatic stand against the Soviet occupation
                        of Afghanistan, but it is trying to avoid giving unnecessary offense to
                        Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> rejected US aid primarily
                        because he believed that accepting it would increase tension with Moscow but
                        would not strengthen Pakistan’s security to a corresponding degree. ([<hi rend="italic">2 lines, classification marking, codeword, and handling

                    <p>Islamabad’s desire to avoid confrontation with Moscow is further reflected in
                        its reluctance to back publicly exile groups in Pakistan and its
                        unwillingness to give extensive help to Afghan insurgents. Pakistan also has
                        tended to avoid publicity on border incidents, including Soviet overflights.

                        not seeking an accommodation with Moscow. Pakistan’s closest allies—Saudi
                        Arabia, Iran, and China—would have serious reservations about any
                        significant move toward Moscow. At home, many Pakistanis—especially the
                        conservatives supporting Zia—would oppose abandoning fellow Muslims in
                        Afghanistan or any “sellout” to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.

                    <p>Pakistani policymakers doubt, moreover, that any agreement with Moscow would
                        bring more than temporary benefits. There also is considerable sentiment in
                        the military—on which <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> ultimately
                        depends—for a continued hardline on Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Pakistani leaders seem to agree on their sense of isolation while facing the
                        Soviets. This has led them to an unprecedented interest in trying to improve
                        relations with India despite longstanding deep distrust of India’s
                        intentions and of its relationship with Moscow. The conflicting advice
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> is getting makes Pakistan’s
                        policy unpredictable. Some aides—notably Foreign Affairs Adviser <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>—seem to favor some agreement
                        with the Soviets but most probably would support an accommodation only if
                        they see no other good alternative. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> next raised the issue
                        of making support for the Afghanistan freedom fighters a publicly
                        respectable undertaking rather than a covert activity which we and other
                        countries feel obliged to deny. He argued that by maintaining the covert
                        posture, we are allowing the Soviets to argue cogently the support for the
                        insurgents as wholly illegitimate while their support for insurgency
                        elsewhere is wholly legitimate. (<gloss target="#t_SS_1">S/S</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Some argued that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> cannot
                        politically afford an overt program. The Saudis will also protest abandoning
                        the covert mode. Finally, for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to
                        take the public lead, the effect would be to “de-Islamicize” the program. It
                        was also argued that the present support programs might be jeopardized.
                            (<gloss target="#t_SS_1">S/S</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that we should
                        not “go public” unless <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and the
                        Saudis approve, but it might be worth exploring with them. Also, one might
                        encourage other Islamic countries, such as Morocco, to support the public
                        stand that Egypt has already taken. (<gloss target="#t_SS_1">S/S</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Harold Brown</persName> recommended that we no longer

                    </list>
                    <p>At your suggestion, I have looked into the question of whether our aid to
                        Muslim forces in Afghanistan is effective. I discovered that those involved
                        in this effort seem to be enthusiastic, motivated, and convinced that
                        everything reasonable and possible that can be done is being done. I sharply
                        disagree. The reason that our “operators” in this area are relatively
                        sanguine about their efforts is that they accept two basic
                        restrictions—i.e., supply only weapons of Soviet manufacture and work
                        exclusively through the Pakistanis—which I consider unnecessary and unwise.
                            (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>It is literally impossible to exaggerate the significance of the outcome of
                        Soviet efforts to crush the Muslim resistance in Afghanistan. If the Soviets
                        succeed, as seems likely, this action will become a powerful precedent
                        within the bureaucracy which will inevitably ensure that we will be faced
                        with other Afghanistans down the road in the 1980’s. Particularly sensitive
                        will be Central America and the Caribbean. Could a United States government,
                        for example, look the other way while a Soviet or a Cuban force of thousands
                        landed in Nicaragua, Honduras, or perhaps even Venezuela, in order to save a
                        self-described progressive government that was going down the drain?
                        Chervonenko, in his recent speech in Paris, said in referring to Allende
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could tolerate <pb n="700" facs="0745" xml:id="pg_700"/>no more Chiles.<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">Telegram 12604 from Paris, April 17, reported on the speech delivered
                            by Chervonenko, Soviet Ambassador to France. Regarding Afghanistan,
                            Chervonenko hewed to standard Soviet positions that the crisis there was
                            not relevant to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> national security
                            and that the Soviet military presence was necessary so long as
                            Afghanistan was threatened by external aggression. (National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D800191–0155)</note> The implications of that remark are sobering, to
                        say the least. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>It is therefore crucial for us to do everything that we possibly can to make
                        the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan extremely costly to the Kremlin. The <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi>, if they had the right kinds of weapons,
                        could considerably impede Soviet mobility and “air-cav” tactics, which give
                        the Soviets an enormous tactical advantage over the resistance forces. Men
                        on horseback are no match for men in helicopters. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Our efforts thus far have been tentative, piecemeal, and inadequate. The
                        Soviets wiped out 372 insurgents in a single operation the other day. We
                        will be seeing many more such reports in the months ahead if the <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi> are not adequately supplied. We should keep
                        in mind that SA–7s are hard to get and very expensive and it is for this
                        reason that we are only planning to supply the Muslims with 85 of these
                        weapons, literally a drop in the bucket. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we must also keep in mind that the Pakistanis are not eager
                        to provide weapons to those who could become future security problems.
                        Punjabis have an inbred reluctance in arming Pathans. They know that the gun
                        pointed against Kabul today might be pointed against Karachi tomorrow.
                            (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we have a natural opening in <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s public criticism of the US for not providing greater
                        support to the resistance forces. We should take him at his word. This is
                        especially the case in that political opposition to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> is mounting and opposition leaders are
                        now calling for rapprochement with the Soviets and the cessation of support
                        for the <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi>. All our eggs should not be in
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s basket. (<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">How to Operate</hi>. There are 53 Afghan refugee camps
                        along the Pakistan border. We should have at least three agents in each of
                        those camps; ostensibly for refugee relief purposes, but principally to
                        ensure that the <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi> are getting the weapons
                        they need. A similar effort should be made in eastern Iran. We should not
                        restrict ourselves to the use of American citizens for this purpose. In
                        addition, we ought to explore and take advantage of traditional gun
                        smuggling routes, which have been used in that part of the world for
                        centuries. There should never be a shortage of the right kinds of weapons in

                            have huge stocks of M–14 rifles which are no longer used by the US Army
                            and which would be ideal for the resistance fighters).</p>
                        <p>—Light mortars, which can be easily disassembled and used effectively by
                            men on horseback.</p>
                        <p>—Simple short-wave two-way radios. (One of the greatest difficulties of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi> is that they cannot coordinate

                        <p>—Small mines (which could be extremely effective in closing lines of
                            communications, thereby forcing the Soviets to expend additional efforts
                            in defending those LOCs).</p></quote>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Public Line</hi>. We could do the above without

                        supplying the rebel forces and have, in fact, used this as their
                        justification for invading Afghanistan. They and their Afghans will make the
                        same amount of noise, which will have roughly the same propaganda effect,
                        whether we are supplying the <hi rend="italic">Mujahidin</hi> effectively or
                        ineffectively. I vote for supplying them effectively. How the world turns

                    <p>The Pakistani Chief of Intelligence has asked for our assistance in providing

                    </list>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Preliminary analysis of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] indicates that circa mid-March
                        1980 Soviet and <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces in Afghanistan
                        began noting significant increases in rebel land mine and anti-tank rocket
                        attacks. This upsurge in such incidents closely coincides with
                        January–February 1980 passage to rebels of land mines, RPG–7 anti-tank
                        rockets and RPG–7 rocket launchers.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Land Mines:</hi> Prior to mid-March 1980 the Soviet and
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> armies encountered very few land
                        mines, but during the first two and one half weeks of April 1980 the Soviets
                        alone had 23 vehicles (including 12 tanks and 8 <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>’s) damaged or destroyed, with nine Soviets killed and three
                        wounded. This prompted the Soviets to arrange for priority air shipment of
                        minesweeping equipment into Afghanistan. The total land mine incidents
                        suffered by <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces is not known (only
                        10% of the data has been analyzed), but preliminary information indicates
                        that the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> has suffered even more than
                        the Soviets. Various reports by <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> forces
                        of actual land mine explosions and other indirect evidence show Afghan exile
                        groups infiltrating the land mines all along the Pakistan border. In
                        addition to the 1,000 Czech land mines supplied the rebels by 26 February
                        1980, the Paks have supplied an additional 700 land mines to the rebels.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Anti-tank Rockets:</hi> Prior to mid-March 1980 <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> and Soviet armies reported few instances
                        of anti-tank rockets being fired by rebel bands. However, beginning
                        mid-March 1980 [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                        showed a significant increase in rebel anti-tank rocket attacks. For <pb n="704" facs="0749" xml:id="pg_704"/>example, on 3 April 1980, the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> 14th Division in Ghazni noted the
                        destruction of two <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>’s by rebel rocket
                        attack inside the city of Ghazni—a new rebel tactic. On 15 April 1980 the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> 17th Division in Herat reported its
                        first rebel anti-tank rocket attack; and two days later seven armored
                        vehicles struck by anti-tank rockets were seen in the Herat area. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] traffic has not
                        been scanned for reports of anti-tank rockets used against Soviet armor, but
                        we suspect that the rebels are also using these weapons against the Soviets.
                        By 26 February 1980 127 launchers and 1,404 RPG–7 rounds had been passed to
                        the rebels, with 33 launchers and 1,000 rockets scheduled for current
                        shipments.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Proof of Arms/Ammo Infiltration Success:</hi> Two
                        detailed reports by a source with <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName>’s Peshawar exile group on weapons he actually saw
                        being funnelled from the Paks to <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> closely match with reports from Pakistan liaison on

                            Armor:</hi> The Soviet and <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> armies
                        in Afghanistan now have over 4,000 tanks and other armored vehicles, plus
                        approximately 20,000 trucks and other vehicles.</p>
                    <p>6. A senior <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> analyst on 24 April 1980
                        noted “both a qualitative and a quantitative increase in rebel capabilities
                        during the past five weeks,” thus adding some credence to our preliminary
                        analysis.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overview</p>
                    <p>China sees the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as both a threat and an
                        opportunity. It is concerned that Moscow has embarked on a new, <pb n="705" facs="0750" xml:id="pg_705"/>aggressive global policy that seeks
                        ultimately to obtain a stranglehold on Western oil supplies. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Beijing believes that the outcome in Afghanistan will set the tone in world
                        politics for years to come and that the Soviet action thus poses a
                        fundamental test for the West. In Beijing’s view, Western acquiescence in
                        Soviet action in Afghanistan will only embolden Moscow and will also lead to
                        international acceptance of the Vietnamese conquest of Kampuchea, where
                        Chinese security interests are more directly at stake. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>For Beijing, the Soviet invasion is an opportunity to advance three key
                        foreign policy objectives: to discredit detente politics in the West; to
                        drive a wedge between the Third World and Moscow; and, most important, to
                        prod the United States into a tougher anti-Soviet stance. With these goals
                        in mind, China is pursuing the same policies in Southwest Asia that it has
                        pushed in the region for several years, although with new emphasis, along
                        the following lines. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Engage the West in the Region.</hi> At the heart of
                        Beijing’s strategy is its effort to get the United States to renew its close
                        ties with Pakistan. It wants Washington to give Pakistan a strong security
                        guarantee and enough military aid to encourage Islamabad to resist firmly
                        the Soviet presence in the region. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Reassure Pakistan.</hi> China has given Pakistan constant
                        reassurance of its support since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and has
                        sent separate high-level political and military delegations to Islamabad.
                        Although China has publicly stated its willingness to aid Pakistan, it has
                        not offered a firm security guarantee or given Pakistan any new military
                        assistance. China is known to be concerned about the stability and the
                        anti-Soviet steadfastness of the <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia-ul-Haq</persName> regime. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Encourage Regional Harmony.</hi> Beijing seeks, over the
                        long term, to create an informal, Western-backed alliance of Southwest Asian
                        countries that can firmly resist further Soviet encroachment in the region.
                        As a key element of this policy, China is encouraging Pakistan to improve
                        ties with India while itself attempting to mend its own relations with New
                        Delhi. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction
                            not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Bog the Soviets Down in Afghanistan.</hi> China seeks to
                        make Moscow pay the highest political price possible for its intervention.
                        It thus opposes any plan to neutralize Afghanistan or any attempts at a
                        compromise solution that would leave the Soviets in control. Beijing is
                        supporting all international measures to isolate the Soviets and is
                        encouraging other countries to aid the Afghan rebels. It is not clear what
                            <pb n="706" facs="0751" xml:id="pg_706"/>assistance—if any—China has
                        given the rebels; Beijing has reportedly sought to assist the rebels through
                        Pakistan, but its effort has met some resistance from Islamabad. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>A number of factors constrain China’s ability to achieve its policy goals and
                        limit the role that Washington can play in the region. Longstanding tensions
                        between the major states in the region limit the cooperation Beijing
                        advocates. China has few positive inducements to offer and is still regarded
                        with suspicion by India, which is the key to the success of this strategy.
                        With the possible exception of Pakistan, there is at present no country that
                        is seeking a greater US security role in the region. Pakistan, India, and
                        some Iranian leaders believe, to varying degrees, that a strong anti-Soviet
                        policy is not in their best interests. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Despite these problems, in the months ahead, China will probably persist in
                        its current policy in the region. Over the longer run, however, it may make
                        tactical adjustments to those policies that it believes are not working. One
                        likely area of adjustment is in Chinese policy toward India, where Beijing
                        seems to be willing to go further toward accommodating New Delhi’s interests
                        than before. The persistent plea for more US aid to Pakistan, a greater US
                        military presence, and a firm US commitment to meet any new Soviet action in
                        the region is unlikely to change. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking

                    <p>Soviet policy toward Europe since the invasion of Afghanistan has been
                        characterized by elements of defensiveness and of opportunism. To a great
                        extent, it is a policy of reactive and ad hoc efforts to exploit what Moscow
                        perceives as significant West European concerns about the wisdom and
                        predictability of US policy toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Moscow’s policy, therefore, is less a “peace offensive”
                        than a combination of blandishments and threats intended to undercut West
                        European support for potential economic sanctions or other retaliatory
                        measures against the Soviet Union. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>In seeking to influence West European opinion, Moscow has strongly condemned
                        West European endorsement of US policies. Threats of a harsh Soviet response
                        have been conveyed directly—as in President <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s letter of 2 March to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>—and have also been evident in the
                        increasingly acerbic tenor of Soviet media commentaries directed at West
                            Europe.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">The letter, a response to a letter
                                <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> sent to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> in late January, was
                            described by <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> during a
                            news conference as “moderate in tone but hard in content,” with a
                            “warning undertone” against West Germany following <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy with regard to Afghanistan.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> was quoted in Bradley
                            Graham, “<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Warns

                        reporting clearly indicates that in private the Soviets have taken care to
                        differentiate between the harsher aspects of Moscow’s public posture and an
                        underlying flexibility in Soviet policy. ([<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p>Overtures to the West Germans appear to be the most frequent and subtle.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has sent two letters to
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>—the <pb n="708" facs="0753" xml:id="pg_708"/>last containing an unexpected invitation to
                        visit Moscow this summer. By means of private channels, which the Soviets
                        have long believed useful in communicating with the Chancellery, Soviet
                        representatives have indicated Moscow’s “interest” in the European
                        Community’s neutralization proposal for Afghanistan, and have also conveyed
                        the message to a Chancellery official that West Germany’s expected refusal
                        to impose economic sanctions on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        was much more important to the Soviet leadership than Bonn’s likely decision
                        to boycott the summer Olympics. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking
                            and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Although private Soviet overtures to the West Germans and other West
                        Europeans lack specific substance, it is evident that Soviet tactics are
                        based on the assumption that US-West European differences are significant
                        and create openings for the Soviets to exacerbate them. The Soviets may
                        believe that the worst of the European reaction to the Afghanistan
                        intervention has passed or that more serious moves—such as specific economic
                        sanctions—can be attenuated by skillful diplomacy. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In either case, the Soviets have opted for a combination of harsh public
                        rhetoric with private hints of a more conciliatory Soviet stance on arms
                        control issues in particular should the West Europeans temper their support
                        for US “hard line” policies toward Moscow. Thus far, however, the Soviets
                        have demonstrated little willingness to make tangible concessions to West
                        European concerns. Nevertheless, West European reservations with respect to
                        US actions in Iran, the implementation of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s decision on theater nuclear force modernization, and

                        personal attention you have given <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Pakistan relations, and I hope that strengthened cooperation
                        between our two nations will help to show the Soviet Union how seriously we
                        view their ruthless and unprovoked aggression in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>I was deeply impressed by the reports of my emissaries of your country’s
                        determination to counter the Soviet challenge. Your leadership at the
                        Islamic Foreign Ministers’ Conference in January was vital in putting the
                        Islamic world on record condemning the Soviet seizure of a neighboring
                        Muslim country. I hope that Pakistan will exercise equally firm leadership
                        at the Islamic Foreign Ministers’ Conference in May to demonstrate that the
                        Islamic world remains united in its condemnation of Soviet actions.</p>
                    <p>One particularly effective way to demonstrate opposition to the Soviet
                        invasion is to boycott the Olympics, and I was pleased to learn privately of
                        your government’s decision not to go to Moscow. Making your position public
                        before the beginning of the Islamic Foreign Ministers’ Conference would
                        increase the likelihood that the moral weight of the Conference will remain
                        behind the boycott.</p>
                    <p>The struggle of the Afghan people against the Soviet occupation forces is one
                        of the most stirring events of our time. I attach the greatest importance to
                        this struggle and know that you share my admiration for the Mujahidin. Not
                        only does their bravery deserve recognition, their ability to continue their
                        resistance brings home the cost of aggres<pb n="710" facs="0755" xml:id="pg_710"/>sion to the Soviets every day. Such resistance,
                        therefore, is in the interest both of the Islamic world and of the
                        democratic Western countries.</p>
                    <p>The United States places a particular value on close consultations between
                        our two governments in these critical times. We are always ready to work
                        with you to find mutually acceptable and effective means of dealing with the
                        problems and concerns that we share. We would be glad to hold any further
                        consultations that you think advisable and will also continue to discuss
                        with our allies those matters which are of interest to you. As you know,
                        those discussions have already helped to mobilize some assistance.</p>

                    <p>2. Summary: In the two years since President Daoud was overthrown and slain
                        by some of the same leftists who helped him stage a bloodless coup ousting
                        King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir</persName> in 1973, the quality of
                        life in Afghanistan and any sense of security and hope for the future on the
                        part of the Afghan people have steadily eroded. Fear, trepidation about the
                        future, and a loathing of the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>
                        regime pervade the atmosphere in this strife-ridden, poverty-stricken
                        country. The “great Saur revolution,” cautiously accepted by many Afghans in
                        mid-1978, is fraying at <pb n="711" facs="0756" xml:id="pg_711"/>the edges,
                        if not tottering, and is the object of widespread and bitter ridicule. No
                        one in Afghanistan believes the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> regime would last 48 hours if the Soviet troops were
                        to pull out now. The failure of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> and his colleagues in the regime to win the support
                        of any significant element of Afghan society and the continued crumbling of
                        the Afghan military virtually guarantee a growing Soviet military presence
                        here, no matter what the cost to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        in global terms. As they are sucked deeper and deeper into the morass of
                        Afghanistan, the Soviets will inevitably be faced with new points of basic
                        decision and ever-increasing frustration, with the concomitant inclination
                        to try to do everything themselves. No matter what they decide to do, they
                        will find their Afghan adventure increasingly costly. Their task will be
                        made no easier by the ongoing rifts among the Parcham and Khalq wings of the
                        ruling Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan. It is unlikely that they
                        will be able to fashion a broad-based governing group, and there are few
                        bets that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> will die a
                        natural death. In these circumstances, the United States and its allies
                        should continue to treat this regime with circumspection and try to make the
                        Soviet invasion as costly as possible for Moscow. End summary.</p>

                        Minister had just met with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FJ_1">Francois-Poncet</persName>:</hi> Yes, it was one of our regularly
                        scheduled meetings, and we felt it would have been more complicated to try
                        to cancel it. Let me report briefly on the conclusions of the meeting.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> had a general hardness
                        of line, and a harsh tone about US-<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        relations, using vocabulary I have not heard before. We had three long
                        discussions with Afghanistan taking up about two thirds of our time. The
                        Soviet objective in Afghanistan is a diplomatic initiative involving Iran,
                        Pakistan and Afghanistan legalizing the Afghan regime and legalizing the
                        Soviet presence. It is clear they want a regional legitimization. When this
                        is done, they then may want to invite outsiders. We told them that we do not
                        see any outside interference, nothing justifying the Soviet invasion, and
                        with this the case, we asked why they did not accept the proposal of having
                        an international body come in. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said no, how could they, there was fighting going
                        on. It would be too dangerous (laughter).</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we got into a discussion of <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard
                            d’Estaing</persName>’s proposal for a withdrawal of troops and
                            self-determination.<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">Not further identified.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> visited Paris April
                            24–25 and met with <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> and
                            Francois-Ponçet. Presumably the proposal was made at that time.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> did not say this is of no
                        interest. He said he accepted the proposal, but only in as much as it helped
                        to promote the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> objective. <hi rend="italic">But</hi> the Soviets say first outside interference must
                        stop. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> balks at a date for
                        Soviet withdrawal. They want a regional approach to “crack the Pakistani
                        nut.” They are embarrassed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Vice President:</hi> Did he express some heat about the
                        Pakistanis?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FJ_1">Francois-Poncet</persName>:</hi> Yes, he was aggressive and insulting
                        about the Pakistanis. He said who does this <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> think he is; he should remember how he came to
                        power.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Vice President:</hi> We have just picked up [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] evidence of
                        construction of a new 9,000-foot air field in southwest Afghanistan. It has
                        a rationale entirely unrelated to the Islamic problem they say is at the
                        basis of their invasion. It looks to us as it is a base for projection of
                        Soviet air power.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FJ_1">Francois-Poncet</persName>:</hi> Generally, our reading of the Soviet
                        move into Afghanistan has not been that there was a master plan with the
                        objective of the Persian Gulf. It is not proven at this stage that they have
                        become prone to military adventurism, but this does not mean that once they
                        are there there will not be other military developments.</p>
                    <p><pb n="713" facs="0758" xml:id="pg_713"/>I have a question. They must get
                        out. We cannot be starry-eyed about this. It may take a long time, but they
                        have to get out. We feel local and regional factors will determine whether
                        or not they do so. Why aren’t the Afghan rebels more effective? Why aren’t
                        they shooting down Soviet helicopters?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName>:</hi> They
                        have shot down about a dozen. They are obtaining SA–7s from defecting Afghan
                        troops. The problem of supply is the narrow Pakistani funnel. The Pakistanis
                        are cautious. A much more promising route would be Iran, but of course we
                        know the problems there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FJ_1">Francois-Poncet</persName>:</hi> Our feeling is that the weapons they
                        have are very limited.</p>

                        aware of casualties. They are reading newspapers.</p>

                        EQUIPMENT</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Army is being destroyed by Soviet weaponry in Afghanistan. For
                        many years the Soviet Union provided military aid to the Afghan Army.
                        Although there can be political benefit in providing military equipment to a
                        border state, the sudden change of circumstances in Afghanistan has proved
                        that this can also bear bitter consequences.</p>
                    <p>After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan last December, the Afghan Army began
                        to dissolve. Rather than fight their fellow Muslims and assist the Soviet
                        invaders, Afghan soldiers, and in many cases full units, began to rally to
                        the tribal forces. When these units changed sides they took with them
                        critical Soviet anti-aircraft and anti-armor equipment, particularly
                        anti-tank rockets which can be fired by one soldier.</p>
                    <p>Reliable reports reaching Afghan exile leaders indicate that Soviet armor and
                        vehicle losses have begun to mount dramatically as a result of the insurgent
                        use of these Soviet weapons. Sources with access to the rebel forces report,
                        for example, that Soviet units in the Herat area of western Afghanistan in
                        April lost several armored vehicles due to attacks by anti-tank rockets. One
                        rebel source described a particularly successful but simple technique used
                        by the Afghans as they become accustomed to the anti-tank weapons. Some
                        Soviet armored vehicles have rubber tires. The rebel soldiers fire on the
                        tires thereby immobilizing the vehicle. Once immobilized, the vehicle is
                        destroyed by the rebels with their new rocket ability. Soviet vehicle losses
                        have reached rates which reportedly are beginning to alarm Soviet
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>Rebel sources also report that the Afghan fighters are beginning to enjoy
                        increased success against the once feared Soviet MI–24 helicopter <pb n="715" facs="0760" xml:id="pg_715"/>gunship. When first introduced into
                        the fighting, the weapon apparently was very successful in intimidating many
                        of the tribal forces. However, as the more experienced Afghan Army defectors
                        swell the tribal ranks, the fighters have learned the helicopters’
                        vulnerability to anti-aircraft ground fire. Refugee reports increasingly
                        tell of gunships being downed by the simple expedient of the rebels firing
                        down on the helicopters’ vulnerable tail rotor from gun implacements high in
                        the mountains. The rebels have discovered, thanks to their newly acquired
                        army allies, that while the helicopter is effective firing at the ground, it
                        is vulnerable to fire from relatively immune positions above the aircraft.
                        Rebel sources indicate that at least nine Soviet helicopters have been lost
                        in the past 60 days.</p>
                    <p>One of the many dilemmas confronting the Soviets in Afghanistan is what to do
                        with the remainder of the Afghan Army. If the Soviets hope to conclude their
                        Afghan adventure successfully, they will eventually need a reliable Afghan
                        force. To build this force, they will have to equip it with weapons which
                        could continue to get into the hands of the rebels.</p>

                    <p>On December 28, 1979—two days after Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan—we
                        expanded the already initiated <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> covert
                        action program there to include for the first time the supply of lethal
                        weapons to the insurgents.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">See <ref target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note> Prior to that date, our
                        program had consisted essentially of covert media efforts (radio broadcasts
                        and leaflet distribution <pb n="716" facs="0761" xml:id="pg_716"/>within
                        Afghanistan), as well as of the provision of some food, medicine, and
                        tactical radio equipment (for field combat use) to various guerrilla
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>The arms being furnished currently are Soviet-made rifles, submachine guns,
                        machine guns, ammunition, mines, and anti-tank launchers and rockets. These
                        items, at first drawn from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> reserve
                        stocks, but now bought by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> on the
                        international arms market, move in <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss>
                        C–141 aircraft [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to
                        Saudi Arabia, and then by Saudi C–130s to Pakistan. No American personnel in
                        Pakistan are in any way involved in the logistics machinery or in training
                        Afghans, though a few Egyptian Specialists may be present. The training
                        function is performed by Pakistani personnel, who, if necessary, have
                        received special training from Americans in Saudi Arabia. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief in Islamabad works out all
                        of the operational details with Pakistani intelligence and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The most critical gap in Afghan rebel armament has been the absence of means
                        to shoot down Soviet helicopters and aircraft. Egypt has now donated 15
                        Soviet-made SA–7 shoulder-held anti-aircraft rocket launchers, with a small
                        supply of missiles. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is purchasing
                        additional such weapons on the international market, through devious
                        cut-outs, from a Bulgarian source. As of one week ago, Pakistan had not yet
                        taken the final decision on whether to transfer the SA–7s, because <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> recognizes that this would be a major
                        escalation of outside support to the insurgents, which could trigger a sharp
                        Soviet reaction. However, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> believes that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> will bite this bullet
                        too.</p>
                    <p>Pakistani cooperation in the program has been exemplary—and completely
                        divorced from the troubles that bedevil the US-Pakistani political
                        relationship. However, this collaboration was put into jeopardy in
                        mid-January [<hi rend="italic">mid-February</hi>] by reports on the program,
                        attributed to White House officials, which appeared in the Washington Post
                        and New York Times. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> was outraged
                        and has made it perfectly clear that Pakistan will stop all participation if
                        there are any further leaks.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">See <ref target="#d209fn3">footnote 3, Document 209</ref>.</note></p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We don’t have much success these days in getting Afghan material to the
                        world’s attention. The story is getting old and we, frankly, don’t offer
                        much in a positive sense (i.e. we can produce atrocity stories but no clear
                        policy line that might yield a satisfactory outcome.) (S)</p>
                    <p>We need to seize some high ground, especially after the failure of the rescue
                        attempt in Iran. Fortunately there is some readily available <pb n="718" facs="0763" xml:id="pg_718"/>high ground. In fact we are there already,
                        although nobody seems to notice it very much for we are sharing it with some
                        noisy types. (S)</p>
                    <p>Specifically, we should double track our current strategy (make the Soviets
                        pay heavily) with a strategy that portrays us as the party urging a peaceful
                        settlement on reasonable terms. We should be the moving spirit of a “peace
                        offensive”—and define its terms. At present, we are in the apparent position
                        of grudgingly accepting the idea of a peaceful settlement while harping on
                        things that people don’t like to hear. And, given our evident lack of
                        interest in a peaceful negotiated outcome, when we do say something positive
                        it tends to be discounted. (S)</p>
                    <p>What is needed is a change in emphasis. We should be talking long and loud
                        about the need for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. We should be
                        pointing out at every opportunity that the Soviets are frustrating this
                        outcome not only by their actions on the ground but also because of their
                        unreasonable and unjust refusal to commit themselves to prompt and total
                        withdrawal. (S)</p>
                    <p>Clearly we would keep up (and if possible intensify) our drumfire of
                        propaganda along the present lines. And we would not yield an inch on our
                        conditions. <hi rend="italic">But</hi> we would try to become identified
                        with the goal of peace rather than the goal of punishing the Soviets
                        (largely, it might be noted, at the price of dead Afghans and unhappy
                        athletes.) (S)</p>
                    <p>This theme should also be featured in our talks with the Soviets. From what I
                        have seen of the reporting, we have been growlingly negative. We should be
                        challengingly positive. Put Moscow more and more on the defensive. Sure, it
                        won’t make much difference in bilateral negotiations (and none of this will
                        likely budge the Soviets out of Afghanistan), but the fact of our emphasis
                        on peaceful settlement will leak out, and play back into our public
                        strategy. (S)</p>
                    <p>The public strategy should be founded on statements by the President,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> and you. The Philadelphia
                        speech, for example, should have had an impassioned plea for peace and a
                        truly non-aligned Afghanistan “if only the Soviets would see reason and meet
                        conditions that are universally supported.” It should have stressed that we
                        have no preferred outcome in Afghanistan as long as the Afghans are

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">OVERVIEW</p>
                    <p>—The Pakistani and US intelligence appraisals of the Afghan war are
                        remarkably similar. Both sides believe the Soviets have encountered
                        unanticipated difficulties, or as General Akhtar said, “the Russians are
                        stuck.” The identity of views is particularly noteworthy because we arrived
                        at our conclusions by different routes. Much of the US judgment is based on
                        sensitive signals intelligence not available to the Pakistanis. The
                        Pakistanis have based their judgment not simply on appraisals we have
                        provided them but on intelligence they received directly from Afghan rebels.
                        The Pakistanis conclude that the Afghan “Freedom Fighters”—as they call
                        them—are doing surprisingly well and will in all likelihood continue to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p><pb n="720" facs="0765" xml:id="pg_720"/>—Neither side had a good estimate of
                        insurgent strength. The Pakistanis feel the Afghan situation is a classic
                        Mao’s “Peoples’ War.” As a Pakistani colonel observed: if an Afghan has a
                        rifle and a bullet he is a soldier; when he loses one, he becomes a
                        civilian. It is therefore not possible to reach a reliable estimate of
                        insurgent strength. Drawing further on Mao, the Pakistanis say the rebels
                        are the fish in this sea. The rebels are careful not to undertake actions
                        which would damage the people’s interest and risk weakening the insurgents’
                        link with their mass base. They want to damage a bridge and force the
                        Russians to expose themselves during its repair rather than to destroy the
                        bridge and injure for years the surrounding economy. Thus, explained the
                        Pakistanis, they cannot, and indeed should not, control the insurgency. The
                        Afghans control it and the Pakistanis support it with materiel, which the
                        Afghans accept, and advice, which may or may not be accepted. This fact
                        establishes the parameters within which the covert support must operate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">COVERT ACTION PROGRAM</p>
                    <p>—Barring a change in the internal or international scene, the Pakistanis are
                        committed to covert support to the Afghans. General Akhtar expressed his
                        concern about lack of US security guarantees but did not pursue the subject
                        and did not make continued support contingent on such aid.</p>
                    <p>—The Pakistanis are providing unilateral weapons support from their
                        stockpiles to the insurgents, support which predates our involvement. When
                        we offered to provide some of the materiel now being provided by Pakistan
                        (e.g., .303 ammunition), General Akhtar waved aside our offer stating he
                        preferred to use Pakistan money for things available in Pakistan and to use
                        our resources for external procurement.</p>
                    <p>—The Pakistanis attempt to control any unilateral exile weapons procurement.
                        They do not want weapons entering Pakistan outside their control and have so
                        informed the Peshawar exile leaders. The Pakistanis share our surprise at
                        the vigor of the insurgency in northeastern Afghanistan (Badakshan and
                        Qonduz Provinces). The Pakistanis suggested some aid may be coming over the
                        mountains from China or that Tadzhik ethnic groups resident in the four
                        border area could be providing support.</p>
                    <p>—General Akhtar described how the support mechanism works. Our weapons arrive
                        at Rawalpindi airport by Saudi C–130 approximately twice a week at dusk.
                        Officers of Akhtar’s organization oversee the unloading. Fortuitously we
                        happened to witness one such unloading while awaiting our aircraft
                        departure. A Pakistani Army tank transporter backed up to the C–130 ramp and
                        the unmarked crates rolled on to the transporter. The whole process took
                        less than an hour. From <pb n="721" facs="0766" xml:id="pg_721"/>the
                        aircraft the crates are taken to a warehouse controlled by Akhtar’s
                        organization where they are opened and the weapons inspected and
                        inventoried. The Pakistanis have excellent records which coincide with ours;
                        what we are buying in Egypt is being delivered in Pakistan. The munitions
                        are distributed through eight different exile organizations which are
                        responsible for transporting the materiel in Afghanistan. There is no
                        Pakistani distribution system in Afghanistan. Akhtar unilaterally monitors
                        the distribution of the weapons and is confident that most of the materiel
                        is indeed going to Afghanistan. Akhtar is distributing weapons into all
                        parts of Afghanistan, not just the eastern area bordering Pakistan. We said
                        we had noted the appearance of anti-tank rockets and land mines around Herat
                        and encouraged Akhtar to continue to distribute the weapons in western
                        Afghanistan through any means he deemed appropriate (i.e., via Iran).</p>
                    <p>—The arms mix has been about right. The Pakistanis had a list of 24 items
                        needed by the insurgents. These items divide basically into four categories:
                        anti-armor, anti-aircraft, AK–47 rifles and ammunition, and miscellaneous
                        equipment such as time detonators, gas masks and wireless equipment.</p>
                    <p>—Akhtar said the present weapons delivery schedule of two C–130’s per week is
                        about the right pace. We emphasized we stand ready to increase the flow
                        whenever he can handle it and we are prepared to fly C–141’s directly into
                        Pakistan under cover of the regular embassy resupply flight.</p>
                    <p>—The Pakistanis need two C–130’s. Akhtar explained that overland transport is
                        too slow and unreliable. The Pakistan Air Force has been helping but due to
                        the loss of two C–130’s they can no longer do so and meet their other
                        obligations. The request for a loan of two aircraft is legitimate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SA–7 MISSILES</p>
                    <p>—Akhtar said the Pakistani Government had made the political decision to use
                        the SA–7’s, “fully aware of its implications.” The Pakistanis forecast three
                        levels of Soviet reaction. The least serious would be no reaction at all;
                        second would be a ground incursion into border areas of Pakistan; and most
                        severe would be a Soviet air strike at Pakistani airfields. We took no
                        exception to his estimate. Soviet retaliation, to a certain extent, will
                        depend on how and where the missiles are used. Akhtar explained that two
                        Afghan groups had been trained in the use of the weapon. Each of these
                        groups will take three missiles and one launcher. The targets will be
                        Shindand and Bagram airfields. Akhtar refused to reveal any timing. The
                        second group is scheduled to complete its training on 17 May.</p>
                    <p>—In reply to Akhtar’s request for more SA–7’s we explained the difficulty
                        finding these in the international market. We told Akhtar <pb n="722" facs="0767" xml:id="pg_722"/>that we understood the Chinese may have
                        SA–7’s. If the Pakistanis could give the appropriate political signal to the
                        Chinese, we would be prepared to do whatever necessary to purchase and
                        deliver the missiles to Pakistan. Akhtar seemed to like the idea and said he
                        would discuss it with President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE</p>
                    <p>—The US side gave a one hour slide presentation on worldwide Soviet and Free
                        World psychological warfare activities. Akhtar was obviously interested in
                        what was going on outside his borders and confessed Pakistan was probably
                        not doing enough in the psywar field. We agreed that the issue was beginning
                        to fade from international attention and that we should work both jointly
                        and separately to insure that the Afghan story continues to be told.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SECURITY</p>
                    <p>—The Pakistanis would vigorously oppose any surfacing of the covert action
                        program and would probably consider it reason for termination. The program
                        is highly compartmented within Pakistan—even within the intelligence
                            service.<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> placed a bracket in the left margin beside this

                        there be no publicity if and when the SA–7’s are fired. Akhtar registered
                        the anticipated complaint about Washington leaks.</p>

                        Specifically, the statement contains the following “new” elements:</p>
                    <p>—explicit identification of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as guarantor of any political
                        settlement; and</p>
                    <p>—recognition of the need to resolve “in the context of political settlement .
                        . . the question of withdrawal from Afghanistan’s territory of the Soviet
                        limited military contingent.”</p>
                    <p>4. On withdrawal, the statement repeats standard Soviet and Afghan
                        formulation that “an end to armed invasions and guarantees that neither
                        invasions nor any other forms of interference in Afghanistan’s internal
                        affairs will be resumed would eliminate the causes which made Afghanistan
                        turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.” The statement also
                        notes that “in concrete terms, the withdrawal . . . will depend on the
                        resolution of the question of effective guarantees of bilateral agreements”
                        with Pakistan and with Iran. Thus, as in previous proposals, withdrawal is
                        made contingent on a prior end to hostilities in Afghanistan on
                            Soviet/<gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> terms and on prior direct
                        negotiations with and hence legitimization of the Babrak regime.</p>
                    <p><pb n="724" facs="0769" xml:id="pg_724"/>5. The timing of the statement
                        suggests its purpose is to take the heat off Kabul at the Islamic Conference
                        meeting starting today in Islamabad and running through May 21.<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">The Conference of Islamic Foreign Ministers, which met
                            May 17–22 in Islamabad, adopted a resolution that condemned the Soviet
                            intervention in Afghanistan and established a committee to consult with
                            all concerned parties and resolve the situation on the basis of Soviet
                            troop withdrawal; recognition of the Afghan people’s right to choose
                            their own form of government; respect for the independence, integrity,
                            and non-aligned status of Afghanistan; and creation of conditions that
                            would allow the refugees to return. (Marvine Howe, “Islamic Conference

                            formation of a “broad-based” government that could still be headed by

                    <p>6. Press guidance—Following press guidance is being used by the
                        Department:</p>
                    <p>Q. What is your reaction to the Afghan Government’s proposal that it hold
                        talks with Pakistan and Iran regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
                        Afghanistan?</p>
                    <p>A. We have seen press reports of the proposal. Our initial assessment is that
                        it is not substantially different from previously articulated positions, is
                        aimed at the legitimization of the Babrak regime rather than anything else,
                        and is obviously timed to attempt to influence discussions at the Islamic
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>7. We regard this initiative as a propaganda device designed to affect the
                        outcome of the Islamic Conference and prevent condemnation of the Soviet
                        action and the actions of the puppet Babrak government. While we think it
                        important to downplay this new proposal and Soviet efforts to describe it as
                        a means of reaching an acceptable political solution to the problem of
                        Afghanistan, we recognize the importance of allied support for our position.
                        This is particularly true regarding the French, British and Germans who have
                        been discussing possible neutrality proposals with us. We suggest the
                        following talking points which could be used with key Islamic countries by
                        ourselves and allies who have been in touch with attendees at Islamic
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p><pb n="725" facs="0770" xml:id="pg_725"/>—We welcome this first explicit
                        mention of the withdrawal of Soviet troops which in our view must be the
                        central focus of any acceptable political settlement of the Afghan
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>—Unfortunately, withdrawal element appears to be only cosmetic in nature,
                        following as it does recognition of Babrak government, legitimization of
                        Soviet invasion and an end to the resistance of the Afghan nationalists.</p>
                    <p>—This first Afghan mention of withdrawal in the context of a political
                        settlement may indicate that they and the Soviets are feeling the costs of
                        their action. If so it is important all concerned countries keep political
                        pressure up to attain prompt and complete Soviet withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>—In our view this can best be achieved by continuing to emphasize Soviet
                        responsibility for the crisis and by continuing to insist that only
                        proposals which focus on withdrawal deserve discussion.<note n="6" xml:id="d270fn6">An article in the National Intelligence Daily, May 16,
                            assessed the Afghan statement as follows: “The new plan does not
                            substantially change Moscow’s longstanding position that Soviet forces
                            cannot be withdrawn until the insurgency has ended and a government
                            friendly to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is firmly in
                            power. Moscow recognizes that a pro-Soviet regime could not survive
                            after a Soviet withdrawal, and the proposal is little more than a
                            Soviet-sponsored attempt to promote international acceptance of the
                            Afghan regime and Soviet intervention.” (Central Intelligence Agency,

                    <p>Foreign Minister <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName></hi> opened the conversation by suggesting that
                        he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> conduct
                        their talks in compact form since they did not have much time at their
                        disposal. It was his understanding that there was no formal agenda for this
                        meeting; thus they would be free to choose whatever topics they wanted to
                        discuss.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> now wanted to turn to the
                        subject of Afghanistan. He would deal with it in the context of how this
                        problem had affected other problem areas between us. First of all, he would
                        like to demonstrate the complete untenability and absurdity of an argument
                        current in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> today. He had not yet
                        heard it from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> in so
                        many words (in this respect being a new man was an advantage), but he had
                        certainly heard many statements on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        side to the effect that the <pb n="728" facs="0773" xml:id="pg_728"/>Soviet
                        Union wanted to dig in in Afghanistan. It was said that the Soviet Union
                        wanted to occupy Afghanistan in order to target the oil-rich regions in the
                        Gulf of Iran, thereby either depriving the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> of the possibility of buying Iranian oil, or making it
                        more difficult to produce and to transport oil from the Persian Gulf to the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to emphasize as
                        strongly as he could that such a view was possible only as a result of a
                        very low level of understanding of Soviet policy, a very low level indeed.
                        Some people were talking of some sort of “Arc of Crisis” which started no
                        one knew where and ended perhaps in Africa or perhaps even in the
                            Atlantic.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">See, for example, <ref target="#d35fn3">footnote 3, Document 35</ref>.</note> The Secretary
                        should realize that such an “arc” existed only in the thinking and
                        imagination of those who talked in this manner. The Soviet Union did not
                        need any kind of Iranian oil. The very manner of looking at the question
                        from this standpoint could only be regarded as schoolboyish, nothing more.
                        He believed it important to explain the Soviet position on this subject to
                        the Secretary. He did not know whether he would be able to convince the
                        Secretary, but such was the Soviet position nevertheless. He would state it
                        on behalf of the entire Soviet leadership and <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">L.I. Brezhnev</persName> personally.</p>
                    <p>Now to the substance of the Afghanistan question. The Soviet Union had
                        introduced its forces into Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan
                        Government in order to assist it in repelling outside aggression against
                        that country. That request had been made not only by the present Afghan
                        leadership, but had also been made repeatedly earlier by <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and before him by <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. The Soviet leadership had
                        reflected on that request for a long period of time, hoping and expecting
                        that the external intrusion would cease. Under the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter such intervention could only be qualified as
                        aggression. When the Soviet leadership saw that this aggression was being
                        expanded, when it saw that forces were being trained and armed on the
                        territory of Pakistan and then sent into Afghanistan, the Soviet Union had
                        sent in its contingent of troops. The Secretary surely knew that the border
                        between Afghanistan and Pakistan runs through a mountainous region and that
                        there were literally hundreds of passages through the unsecured border. Each
                        year at least 100,000 people crossed through them. When forces crossed from
                        Pakistan, where they had been armed and trained, the Soviet Union had come
                        to the conclusion that it must send in its own forces to put an end to the
                        threat to Afghan independence. At the very outset, the Soviet Union had
                        stated that as soon as the reasons for which it had sent in its forces
                        ceased to exist, and as soon as the Afghan Government was in a position to
                        ensure its country’s independence, <pb n="729" facs="0774" xml:id="pg_729"/>the limited Soviet troop contingent would be withdrawn from the territory
                        of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union had stated that on the very first day of
                        its action, and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government had the
                        text of the relevant Soviet statement. He would repeat that statement today
                        and add that there was no need for the Soviet Union to say anything else in
                        clarification. There had been no zigzags in Soviet policy. If anyone on the
                        Western side believed that the Soviet Union would comply with the wishes
                        expressed in several capitals, and withdraw its forces as a precondition for
                        a political settlement in Afghanistan, he would have to tell the Secretary
                        very frankly that those who had such expectations were very poorly informed
                        of the actual situation. They had their heads in the clouds and were
                        engaging in fantasy and unrealistic polemics.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, statements continue to be made, calling upon the Soviet Union
                        to withdraw its forces. That is totally ruled out. He would repeat that as
                        soon as aggression against Afghanistan from the territory of Pakistan and to
                        a lesser extent from that of Iran was halted, the Soviet troop contingent
                        would be withdrawn. He was availing himself of the opportunity to clarify
                        Soviet policy for the Secretary.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Secretary might
                        want to ask the question (and he had encountered such questions in his talks
                        with others): was it really true that there was a massive invasion into
                        Afghanistan from the territory of Pakistan or Iran for the purpose of
                        fighting against the present Afghan regime? He would ask the Secretary to
                        look into this matter more thoroughly. He would suggest that he ask
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia ul-Haq</persName>, President of Pakistan, that he
                        ask if there are dozens of camps on the territory of Pakistan where forces
                        are being assembled, trained and equipped, and whether incursions into the
                        territory of Afghanistan are taking place. Even President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> had recently said publicly: “Yes,
                        we do assist those forces and will continue to assist them.” He had called
                        this assistance, but in fact it was a struggle against the regime in
                        Afghanistan. President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had
                        confirmed this and said that he was aware that this was taking place, but
                        that he could do nothing to stop it. It was strange, indeed, that the
                        President of Pakistan cannot stop all this, although it was taking place on
                        the territory of his country; that he was unable to put his house in order.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> wondered if the Soviet
                        Union should offer its assistance to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> to accomplish that purpose. However, he had not heard
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> make such a request of
                        anyone. As for the domestic affairs of Afghanistan, one thing had to be said
                        firmly: questions of the internal leadership of Afghanistan were internal
                        affairs of that country and could only be resolved by the Afghans
                        themselves. No one had the right to interfere in these matters. The
                        President of Pakistan had said that he did not wish to negotiate with the
                        President of Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        wondered whether <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had asked
                        himself the question of <pb n="730" facs="0775" xml:id="pg_730"/>how many
                        people liked the present leadership of Pakistan. Many people recalled that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> himself had come to power at
                        the point of a rifle or bayonet; but now <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> did not want to talk to these people, although people
                        did talk to him. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to
                        emphasize that the core of this problem was that any settlement had to be
                        arrived at in negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, that there must
                        be peace between these two countries. The Afghan leadership agreed with this
                        premise and was prepared to enter into negotiations. Naturally, Iran must be
                        involved as well, but first and foremost this was a matter of relations
                        between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Just two days ago the Afghan leadership
                        had once again made its proposal, but <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> says that he does not want to sit down at a table with
                        them. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> would urge the
                        Secretary to try and persuade <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> to
                        enter into negotiations. If he genuinely wished to settle this matter
                        peacefully, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> must be persuaded to
                        enter into negotiations. The Soviet Union was certainly in favor of a
                        political settlement, and believed that such a settlement was necessary and
                        possible. Thus, it was necessary to persuade <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. As soon as the invasion of Afghanistan was halted and a
                        settlement reached, and relations between Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran
                        returned to a peaceful basis, Soviet forces would be withdrawn and
                        Afghanistan’s neutrality would be guaranteed. Of course, guarantees would be
                        required and, as <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had said,
                        one such guarantor power could be the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>,
                        perhaps also the Soviet Union and some other countries. That question, too,
                        should be discussed between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> could not understand why this was
                        not acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He had explained
                        his position to the Secretary. He had explained that the Soviet Union
                        favored a peaceful solution, but no one should demand that Afghanistan
                        conduct its affairs to suit some other capital, whether it be London or any
                        other. In conclusion, he would point out that this was an internal matter
                        for Afghanistan. He would urge the Secretary to reflect on this matter. In
                        the Soviet view it was something well worth reflecting on. If such a course
                        is followed and a settlement reached, the question of Afghanistan will
                        simply disappear and disappear completely. It was currently being used in an
                        artificial manner to stop progress on other issues. While the Secretary
                        might not agree, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> was certain
                        that it can and must be resolved in a political manner.</p>
                    <p>There were two more issues <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        wanted to address briefly—China and Iran.</p>

                        Information Committee, which is responsible for insuring public awareness of
                        Soviet activities in Afghanistan, presented a report on its activities and
                        some recommendations. It has had more success recently in attracting media
                        coverage. Nine recommendations were considered by the <gloss target="#t_SCC_1">SCC</gloss>, as follows:</p>
                    <p>—Strengthening the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> presence in Peshawar,

                        newsmen obtain stories on Afghanistan and develop their own news networks
                        inside and outside that country. (Approved)</p>
                    <p>—Systematically encourage editors at home offices in Europe and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to send reporters to tap the real
                        resources available among the refugees in Peshawar. (Approved)</p>
                    <p>—White House and State Department spokesmen should repeatedly indict the
                        Afghan Government and their Soviet mentors for refusal to allow in Western
                        reporters. (Approved)</p>
                    <p>—Instruct Embassies Delhi and Islamabad to give regular background briefings
                        to large <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and foreign press corps on
                        Afghanistan, and to locate any local films and still pictures which can be

                    <p>—The President, Vice President, and Secretary of State include statements on
                        Soviet actions in Afghanistan in public statements (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>’s press conference May 20 offers a

                        <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>. Subject: (S) The Pakistan
                        Dimension in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Response to Soviet
                        Aggression in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>1. (S) Entire text.</p>
                    <p>2. I address you directly, Mr. Secretary, to suggest that we need to have a
                        whole new look at our policies and actions in Pakistan, especially as they
                        relate to the Afghan situation. As things now stand, we state publicly, and
                        privately to our friends, that strengthening Pakistan is a central element
                        in our response to the Soviet invasion next door. But we are doing almost
                        nothing to carry out that declared policy.</p>
                    <p>3. Unless we narrow this gap between our public stance and the concrete
                        actions we intend to take, it will shortly become so conspicuous that I fear
                        sharply adverse consequences for our national objectives and prestige.</p>
                    <p>4. The Pakistanis have asked us explicitly for economic assistance.<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">Documentation on Pakistani requests for economic
                            assistance is scheduled for publication in <ref target="frus1977-80v19"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1977–1980, vol. XIX,
                                South Asia</ref>.</note> However, we will shortly have to tell the
                        Paks and others (at an aid consortium meeting June 12) (A) that we have no
                        economic help to offer in the current fiscal year, (B) that we plan for none
                        at all in fiscal ’81 and (C) that even in fiscal ’82 it is doubtful that we
                        will give substantial economic help. The Agency for International
                        Development (AID) has strongly resisted putting any funds at all into its
                        budget request for fiscal ’82.</p>
                    <p>5. The Paks have asked us to give top priority in our economic assistance to
                        re-scheduling their debt repayments to us, which amount to over $130 million
                        per year. Given present <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attitudes in
                        Washington, it is very doubtful that we will make any meaningful move toward
                        debt rescheduling. Thus our friends, and the Pakistanis, will draw their own
                        adverse conclusions about our real intentions despite what we say our
                        policies are.</p>
                    <p>6. I am very much aware that we have genuine problems in getting resources
                        with which to carry out our foreign, and indeed our domestic, policies, and
                        that Pakistan is by no means the only country where our objectives are not
                        supported by adequate resources. There are no easy <pb n="734" facs="0779" xml:id="pg_734"/>solutions, but I hope you and others in Washington will
                        consider whether, and how, a special effort should be made to avoid the
                        predictably adverse results for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        interests if we persist in our present courses with Pakistan. I see these
                        results here and world-wide to be (in priority order):</p>
                    <p>A. A <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> failure to give meaningful support
                        to Pakistan could very well cause the Soviets to conclude that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> does not have the serious intention to
                        counter further Sov expansionist moves in this region or elsewhere. And a
                        weak Pakistan, without substantial support, would likewise tempt the Sovs to
                        increase their pressures on Pakistan—such as raids on <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> territory—that would pose new challenges
                        for the region and for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> that would
                        be difficult or impossible for us to counter.</p>
                    <p>B. A number of our important friends will find it impossible to understand
                        why we withhold support for Pakistan. We placed heavy pressure on the
                        Europeans, Saudis, and Japan to increase their aid to Pakistan, which many
                        have already done. Others, including the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, are watching us closely to see whether we will respond
                        effectively to the many global challenges that beset us. No matter how
                        carefully we explain our very real budgetary problems and our domestic
                        economic difficulties, many will conclude that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> lacks the capability, and perhaps also lacks the will, to
                        play the role in the world that they want us to play and that we say we want
                        to play.</p>
                    <p>C. More parochially, and of lesser importance, is the severe effect on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>
                        bilateral relations if we withhold support. President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and many others will conclude that we
                        are so unhappy with him that we are deliberately trying to topple his
                        government so we can deal with another, perhaps elected, govt more to our
                        liking, and perhaps more responsive to our anti-nuclear views. Many
                        Pakistani leaders will also suspect, bizarre though it may seem, that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, the Sovs, and India have some
                        secret understanding that involves keeping Pakistan weak. Whatever the exact
                        content of these unjustified <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>
                        suspicions, we can be sure that there will be a sharp rise in
                        anti-Americanism and an even greater <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>
                        disposition to espouse leftist “nonaligned” positions. These public
                        manifestations of a Pakistani turn away from the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will in turn have deleterious effects on the attitudes of
                        other countries who will see them as evidence of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> mishandling of relations with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>7. Actions that it is possible for us to take to remedy these consequences
                        are few, and at best palliative. I do not recommend that we re-structure our
                        existing security agreement of 1959, because I do not see it in our interest
                        to tie ourselves too closely to this <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>
                        Government, which is hardly a strong and reliable partner, and which has
                        nuclear and other policies [with] which we profoundly disagree. No
                        foreseeable <pb n="735" facs="0780" xml:id="pg_735"/>alternative to

                        more successful or favorable to our interests than his government at this
                        time. But I believe, and <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy papers
                        state, that we have important interests here, in promoting regional
                        stability, avoiding conflict, countering Soviet expansionism, and not least
                        in seeing that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is perceived as
                        actually carrying out its professed policies. I therefore hope that we can
                        examine anew the possibilities for economic assistance to Pakistan, and come
                        to some better decisions before the aid consortium meeting June 12.</p>
                    <p>8. I would give top priority to debt rescheduling, which all the other
                        members of the consortium are ready to do, and where we are the only
                        hold-out. Given our very real budget constraints, congressional attitudes,
                        and Treasury and <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> policies, only a
                        directive from the President has any chance of changing the present <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> hard-line stance.</p>
                    <p>9. I have been told that there is no possibility of finding funds, and
                        authorizations, for economic assistance to Pakistan in the upcoming <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 81 budget. I hope that this can be tested
                        out again, to see whether priorities can be rearranged.</p>
                    <p>10. <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>–480 sales of agricultural
                        commodities are being projected at low, or very indefinite levels. These
                        should be examined, and raised substantially.</p>
                    <p>11. A substantial grant of funds for relief of nearly a million Afghan
                        refugees would be useful and logical, and would help to avoid a totally
                        negative <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stance at the consortium
                        meeting. Substantively, too, our interests will be served by helping the
                        Paks avoid the disruptive and destabilizing effects of this large number of
                        Afghans in its border provinces.</p>
                    <p>12. The <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 82 budget request, now being
                        constructed in Washington, should be carefully considered, to see that
                        economic assistance to Pakistan is adequate to match our policies,
                        particularly in aid inputs, in [garble] and in <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>–480.</p>
                    <p>13. None of these suggestions will be new to Washington policy-makers, and
                        none of them will be easy. You will hear strong and cogent reasons why they
                        are impossible or at best difficult. Still, I hope that you will use your
                        influence to see that our important policy goals are not made unattainable
                        by essentially procedural difficulties, real though they are, within our own
                        government.</p>

                    <p>8285. Subject. Soviet Concern About Spill-Over of Islamic Fundamentalism From
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>1. (C—<gloss target="#t_Noforn_1">Noforn</gloss>—Entire text)</p>
                    <p>2. During a May 14 reception for members of the Incidents at Sea (INCSEA)
                        Delegations, Acting Political Counselor engaged a Soviet Navy Captain 1/R
                        Valentin Alekseyevich Serkov in a conversation on Afghanistan. After
                        remarking that it was heartening to learn that the INCSEA talks were
                        proceeding well, A/PolCouns referred to the overall state of bilateral
                        relations and commented that the Soviet action in Afghanistan had undermined
                        détente.</p>
                    <p>3. Serkov responded along the following lines: “You Americans must understand
                        Soviet history in order to understand our actions in Afghanistan. It took
                        the Soviet Government twenty years to suppress the Muslim resistance in
                        Central Asia and to establish the Soviet Republics there. It was a bloody
                        and costly struggle. Accordingly, we were not going to just stand by and see
                        a Soviet-supported government on the borders of the Soviet Union overthrown
                        by the same forces of Muslim fundamentalism which we had conquered in the
                        Soviet Union earlier. This is the major reason we sent our troops into
                        Afghanistan.”</p>
                    <p>4. Comment: Serkov is the Deputy Head of the Soviet INCSEA Delegation. He has
                        been involved in INCSEA matters since before the agreement was signed in
                        1972, and is familiar to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> members as an
                        extremely serious, dedicated party member. He is thought to be the
                        controlling member of the Soviet delegation, often cowing higher ranking
                        members. His influence appears to far outstrip the rank he wears. Serkov is
                        not given to thoughtless, emotional or inadvertent remarks.</p>
                    <p>5. It is unusual to hear an official Soviet make so explicit his concern
                        about the possible spill-over of Islamic militancy into Central Asia should
                        the anti-regime forces in Afghanistan not be checked. Periodically Soviet
                        media try to “sell” the intervention in Afghanistan by drawing a parallel
                        between these forces and the “Basmachi” movement which carried on guerrilla
                        war against the Soviet authorities in Central Asia until well into the
                        1930’s. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on March 7, for example, pub<pb n="737" facs="0782" xml:id="pg_737"/>lished a letter from a Frunze
                        resident (probably a Kirghiz) citing his own upbringing in an atmosphere of
                        “Basmachi” violence and his support for Soviet aid to Afghanistan, a “victim
                        of outside aggression” like the Soviet Union in the interwar years.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">The Basmachi movement refers to the Muslim
                            insurrection against Soviet domination in Central Asia, particularly
                            Turkistan, approximately 1917–1926.</note> More recently, during a
                        television broadcast, <hi rend="italic">Literaturnaya Gazeta</hi> editor
                        Aleksandr Chakovskiy, recalled to viewers the Basmachi movement and, in the
                        next breath, stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cannot
                        permit its Afghani border to become a springboard for attacks against the

                    <p>Much of the future of our relationship to the Soviet Union and to Europe
                        hinges on the evolution of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. The marker
                        has been laid down by us, by the Europeans, and by the Islamic countries
                        that the Soviets must withdraw their troops.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets, however, have made it clear that they will not withdraw their
                        troops as long as the Parchamist government is threatened. Some type of
                        compromise will ultimately be necessary if we are to avoid a long-term
                        Soviet presence and a gradual erosion of the policies we have adopted in

                        <p>Here, for consideration, is a possible approach to resolving the Afghan
                            crisis. It would propose the establishment of a four power commission
                            with two non-aligned Islamic states and two Warsaw Pact states as
                            members, the withdrawal of Soviet troops and their replacement by troops
                            of non-aligned Islamic and Warsaw Pact nations, the establishment of a
                            more broadly-based government under a Parchamist president, and a
                            guarantee of Afghanistan’s non-alignment by the states of the commission
                            and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assumption:</p>
                        <p>—The primary <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest is to get
                            Soviet troops out of proximity to the Persian Gulf in southern
                            Afghanistan and to reduce Soviet influence in that country.</p>
                        <p>—Sanctions and other measures against the Soviet Union are not likely to
                            result in their withdrawal from Afghanistan. The US faces an erosion of
                            support for Afghan-related sanctions against the Soviet Union and of
                            opposition to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan in the Third World
                            unless there is genuine momentum toward a solution.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets would probably like to find a way to reduce their direct
                            involvement in Afghanistan, but they are not likely to withdraw if it
                            means the destruction of the Parchamist revolution. A compromise <pb n="739" facs="0784" xml:id="pg_739"/>solution which protects Soviet
                            interests as they see them is, therefore, necessary.</p>
                        <p>—A direct US initiative is likely to be rejected by the Soviet Union. A
                            successful initiative must not have a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> label.</p>
                        <p>—An accommodation between the Parchamists and at least some of the
                            Islamic revolutionary forces in Afghanistan cannot be ruled out.
                            (Intelligence suggests that Babrak may already be in touch with some
                            Islamic leaders.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Elements of a Solution</p>
                        <p>1. A four power commission consisting of two non-aligned nations which
                            are members of the Islamic Conference, two Warsaw Pact nations, and, as
                            non-voting members, Pakistan and Iran. All member nations should have
                            diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (One possible composition:
                            Hungary, Poland, Indonesia, and Sudan.) The functions of the commission
                            would be to:</p>

                        <p>—Supervise the retraining and reforming of the Afghan army and their
                            replacement of both Warsaw Pact and non-aligned forces; this to be
                            accomplished within one year.</p>
                        <p>—Supervise the return of refugees.</p>
                        <p>—Oversee the establishment of and functioning of a broadly-based

                        <p>2. A government under a Parchamist (Babrak or another) as President with
                            a Prime Minister and at least one-half of the cabinet to be appointed
                            from non-Parchamist Islamic elements acceptable to the commission. The

                            Interior Minister and Minister of Information must be agreed to by all
                            members of the commission.</p>
                        <p>3. Creation of an Afghanistan rehabilitation fund by the Islamic
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>4. Guarantee of Afghanistan’s non-alignment and neutrality by the powers
                            in the commission, plus the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Procedure</p>
                        <p>1. The United States would float the idea with a friendly power which
                            would then carry it forward without a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> label. We could <pb n="740" facs="0785" xml:id="pg_740"/>do this either directly to an Islamic country
                            (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Tunisia) or with one of our European
                            allies which would, in turn, discuss the question with the Islamic
                            countries directly concerned.</p>
                        <p>2. The idea would be proposed and adopted by the council of the Islamic
                            nations which would choose a group to present it to Babrak.
                            (Supplementary approaches would be made to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>3. When agreement is reached on an approach by all parties concerned, it
                            would then be put before the Security Council for approval. The
                            four-nation commission would report to the Security Council.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arguments</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pro</p>
                        <p>—If approved, it would expedite the departure of the Soviet forces from
                            Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>—It would remove the Afghan matter as a major obstacle to cooperation
                            with the Soviet Union in other fields. (e.g., arms control)</p>
                        <p>—It would avoid the almost certain erosion of support for our present
                            policies on Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>—It would remove Warsaw Pact military presence to north of the Hindu
                            Kush.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Con</p>
                        <p>—Communist influence would clearly be established and recognized in
                            Afghanistan by the international community.</p>
                        <p>—Such a solution would mean the end of the open armed opposition to the
                            Parchamists and of international support for that opposition.</p>
                        <p>—The proposal contains elements difficult to achieve, such as the
                            introduction of non-Parchamist elements into the government and the
                            agreement of the Soviets to permit non-communist forces to replace
                            theirs in the South.</p>
                        <p>—A proposal of this kind at this time could conceivably undercut the
                            recent resolutions of the Islamic Conference which called for the
                            complete and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet forces.<note n="5" xml:id="d276fn5">See <ref target="#d270fn4">footnote 4, Document

In telegram
                            137543 to Moscow and other posts, May 24, the Department provided policy
                            guidance for discussions with Eastern European governments in response
                            to a “tough speech” delivered by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Petar

                            the world. It is the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which has challenged
                            the premise of international relations and had a profoundly negative

                        instructions, made a general presentation of our views on these subjects. On
                        the overall state of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> repeated the Soviet
                        position that responsibility for normalization of relations and repairing
                        the damage is that of the United States administration. He took an
                        uncompromising line on the Afghanistan question and urged the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to “be more or less objective” so that “a
                        common language can be found” to resolve this issue. He said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> underestimated the significance of the May
                        14 Afghan proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note></p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        remarks.</note></p>
                    <p>You emphasize that Afghanistan is the main event which has brought about the
                        deterioration in relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and the Soviet Union and which is responsible for the general deterioration
                        in the international situation. We categorically reject this. We believe
                        that the problem has been artificially exaggerated. Afghanistan is not the
                        main problem, especially if it is viewed factually. In any event,
                        Afghanistan should not be viewed as a problem resulting in negative
                        consequences for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations and
                        for international relations in general. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> completely distorts the meaning of Soviet actions and the
                        introduction of Soviet forces into Afghanistan. We introduced those <pb n="742" facs="0787" xml:id="pg_742"/>forces to help Afghanistan repel
                        aggression and did so according to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        Charter and our treaty with the Government and leadership of Afghanistan. We
                        have not violated anything by that action and have acted in accordance with
                        international law. We categorically reject all these distortions of the
                        situation which are made by Washington. We shall withdraw our forces after
                        we are requested to do so from the Afghan Government and, of course, if
                        there is such a request. Also, our withdrawal is dependent on whether or not
                        interference and intervention cease from Pakistan and Iran and they stop
                        fighting against the legitimate Government of Afghanistan. The withdrawal of
                        our forces will be accomplished also when an agreement is reached and it is
                        guaranteed. The question of a withdrawal of our forces before that is beside
                        the point. Those who raise such questions are wasting not only their time
                        but our time. We have expressed our position publicly and <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName> has done so on more than
                        one occasion. Our position has been explained to the United States and I
                        repeated it the last time in my meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d277fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d272">Document 272</ref>.</note> Our position should
                        be clear to you. Why does the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> continue
                        to take such an unrealistic position on Afghanistan after all these
                        explanations? We are aware of what Washington and the West wish to see
                        happen (in Afghanistan) but are you prepared to take a realistic position?
                        If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> were prepared to be more or less
                        objective, a common language can be found but, I repeat, only if you are
                        prepared to look objectively at the situation and take an objective
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the Afghan proposal which was recently made and which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has been critical of, it seems to us that
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> underestimates the significance of
                        that proposal. If you do wish to settle the situation around Afghanistan,
                        your attitude would be different. The Afghan proposal is aimed at
                        normalizing the situation around Afghanistan, including Pakistan. It is a
                        good basis for normalizing the situation.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>14. Upon the completion of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s
                        remarks I told him that I would, of course, communicate what he said to my
                        government and that it would be useless at this point to try to address each
                        point he had made, many of which I took strong objection to. I then singled
                        out some of his key statements for rebuttal and made the following
                        comments.</p>
                    <p>15. Since the beginning of our relationship with the Soviet Union we think
                        there has not been anything that parallels the Soviet Union’s invasion of
                        Afghanistan which was recognized as a non-aligned state. I stressed the
                        importance of the historical implications of the Soviet <pb n="743" facs="0788" xml:id="pg_743"/>Union’s actions and that they had
                        endangered international stability and peace. The Soviet Union must
                        understand this. It is now necessary to find a way to make some progress in
                        removing tensions lest the world situation become even more dangerous. In
                        this respect the Soviet Union must live up to its responsibilities as a
                        world power.</p>

                    <p>1. During a meeting of senior Pakistani military officers on 24 May 1980,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>-ul Haq was given a
                        briefing by the Master General of Ordnance and Lt. General <persName corresp="#p_KAAR_1">Akhtar Abdul Rahman Khan</persName>, Director
                        General of the Inter Services Intelligence Directorate (<gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss>), on weapons covertly supplied by the
                        Government of Pakistan (<gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>) to the Afghan
                        Islamic nationalist insurgents (<gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>’s).
                        Weapons recently supplied were listed as follows:</p>
                    <p>A. 300,000 rounds of .303 rifle ammunition</p>
                    <p>B. 500 .303 rifles</p>
                    <p>C. 50 anti-tank hand-held 75 <gloss target="#t_mm_1">mm</gloss> rocket
                        launchers</p>
                    <p>D. 30 field radio communications sets</p>
                    <p>E. an unknown quantity of plastic explosives and other demolitions</p>
                    <p><pb n="744" facs="0789" xml:id="pg_744"/>2. Commenting on the method of
                        supply, General Akhtar said that he and the Director of Military
                        Intelligence coordinate these activities through their own agents, that all
                        markings on the equipment were erased and that all ammunition supplied is
                        without markings. All ammunition and equipment is moved into Afghanistan
                        through small groups of trusted agents.</p>
                    <p>3. Lt. General <persName corresp="#p_AKM_1">K.M. Arif</persName>, Chief of
                        Martial Law Administration Staff, objected to these activities and said that
                        such actions would provoke the Soviets and invite their retaliation. By
                        undertaking such activities, the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> was
                        moving into a confrontation policy with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>4. General Akhtar disagreed with General <persName corresp="#p_AKM_1">Arif</persName> and commented that the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>’s are stronger now and they should receive continued <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> support.</p>
                    <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> basically agreed with
                        Akhtar’s position, commenting that the Saudi Arabian Government had recently
                        asked about the extent of <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> support to
                        the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>’s. General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> closed the discussion by stating that
                        because of the sensitive nature of the issue he told the Saudis at the
                        Islamic Conference that he would provide King <persName corresp="#p_KIAAA_1">Khalid</persName> with all the details at their next meeting.</p>

                    <p>1. It may be possible to use Pakistan’s close intelligence connection with
                        Iran to increase the flow of weapons to the Afghanistan fighters. Pakistani
                        Intelligence Chief General Akhtar has made several veiled references to
                        connections with his Iranian counterparts. He has refused to identify this
                        link or provide any elaborating data, but he recently provided one example
                        of its use. We provided intelligence to the Pakistanis on a bloody Soviet
                        offensive in the heavily Shi’ite areas of central Afghanistan. The intent
                        was to place the material in the Islamabad press at the time of the Islamic
                        Conference. Time factors made this impossible, but General Akhtar, acting on
                        his own, used the material to prepare a report for his Iranian contacts on
                        the suffering of Shi’ites in Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">An
                            intelligence information cable prepared in the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> reported on a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Q_1">Qotbzadeh</persName> at the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers
                            in Islamabad, May 24. Regarding Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_Q_1">Qotbzadeh</persName> was quoted as saying: “some appeasement time
                            in delaying tactics” would be required in dealing with the Soviet Union,
                            and that the Soviets had intimated to Iran that they could cause trouble
                            in Baluchistan, which, <persName corresp="#p_Q_1">Qotbzadeh</persName>
                            told <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, neither Iran nor
                            Pakistan could afford. In response to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s assertion that the Afghan insurgency was gaining
                            strength, <persName corresp="#p_Q_1">Qotbzadeh</persName> said that Iran
                            would increase its support of the insurgents by 30 percent in June. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Q_1">Qotbzadeh</persName> agreed that at some point
                            their respective countries would have to talk with the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> regime, but doing so should be
                            delayed as long as possible given the possibility that the Afghan
                            Government would collapse within the next two months. (Department of
                            Defense, Afghan War Collection, Box 5, <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> Support for Insurgents)</note></p>
                    <p>2. The Pakistanis are presently receiving all the weapons that they can
                        distribute through their mechanisms. It is possible that the Pakistanis,
                        through their Iranian links, could arrange for the delivery of additional
                        weapons to fighters in western Afghanistan. We propose to suggest to General
                        Akhtar that he approach his Iranian contacts and offer to fly Soviet weapons
                        to Iran for onward distribution in Afghanistan. The weapons could be flown
                        directly from Islamabad to airfields in eastern Iran on the C–130’s to be
                        loaned to Pakistan. Neither the origin of the weapons nor our role in their
                        procurement would be <pb n="746" facs="0791" xml:id="pg_746"/>mentioned. We
                        believe Pakistan would honor a proviso not to use our aircraft to deliver
                        embargoed items to Iran.</p>
                    <p>3. Given the political sensitivity of shipping <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-procured arms via Iranian authorities and our inability to
                        control the weapons once they reach Iran, we request your prior approval of
                        this proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">In his reply to <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>, June 2, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> approved <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>’s proposal, “provided adequate
                            assurances can be obtained that such weapons will not be diverted by the
                            Iranians to other purposes (including retention by the Iranians
                            themselves).” Noting “the extreme importance of the Afghanistan

                    <p>The ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) of Afghanistan, in which Moscow
                        has a substantial stake, is beset by longstanding divisions. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>’s regime would have
                        fallen apart by now were it not for constant Soviet pressure on the feuding
                        factions—Babrak’s Parcham (Banner) and the Khalq (People’s) of former
                            Presi<pb n="747" facs="0792" xml:id="pg_747"/>dents <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>—to work together. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Still, personal enmity and the settling of old scores between the more
                        numerous Khalqis and their Parchamist adversaries continue in spite of
                        Soviet attempts at mediation. Moreover, as the intraparty struggle erodes
                        the authority and saps the energies of the PDP’s leaders, the Soviets will
                        become even more involved in the regime’s day-to-day decisionmaking process.
                            ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The strains in the regime are the same as those that weakened the governments
                        of <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> before the Soviet intervention.
                        Soviet military intervention and political interference, far from bringing
                        the two party factions together, have sharpened the antagonisms dividing
                        them. Moscow could engineer yet another coup, but the Soviets are unlikely
                        to come up with a new leadership that will achieve Moscow’s objective of
                        restoring stability under a Soviet-dominated regime. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>As they try to deal with the infighting, the Soviets are concerned that
                        Babrak’s faction in the military is weaker than its Khalqi rival. If the
                        Soviets are ever to disengage from Afghanistan, they must first rebuild the
                        demoralized Army and ensure its loyalty to the regime. Babrak’s weak
                        position in the military is a serious vulnerability Moscow must confront and
                        probably will be an important factor in any Soviet consideration of an
                        alternative leadership. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and
                            handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Babrak recognizes that he remains in power only as long as Moscow believes he
                        can serve Soviet interests. As he and the Khalqis vie for Soviet backing,
                        Moscow will face difficult choices in estimating the prospects for each
                        faction in holding the regime together and, over the longer term, governing
                        effectively in the absence of Soviet occupation forces. For the foreseeable
                        future, however, Moscow will not be able to look to its clients in Kabul to
                        shoulder the burden of protecting Soviet interests in Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not

                    <p>In opening the discussion, <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> asked <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> if our lack of success with the Allies in
                        persuading them to respond vigorously to the Afghanistan crisis was an
                        indication that they disagreed with our strategic analysis of the situation.
                        He noted that our original rationale had been to try to persuade the Soviets
                        to withdraw and to deter repetition of the Soviet invasion. The Secretary
                        asked if the Europeans had in effect accepted a permanent Soviet occupation
                        of Afghanistan. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss></hi>
                        said yes, <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName></hi> thought that was indeed the case, and <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName></hi>
                        added that there was an important train of thought in Europe that argued
                        that we would in the end have to trade Western acceptance of the Babrak
                        regime for eventual Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                    <p>Responding to <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>’s</hi> observation that these issues should be
                        discussed at the Venice Summit, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> stressed that it was
                        important for the leaders of the West to talk together in detail about the
                        strategic challenge, either formally or informally at dinner. Before going
                        to the Summit, the President would have to decide if he wished to pose
                        sharply and directly the strategic issues we confront, or to soft-pedal
                        them. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> thought that
                        the President should use the Venice forum to portray the Soviet challenge as
                        he saw it and to make clear that palliatives such as a partial Soviet
                        withdrawal from Afghanistan would not work. With this approach the President
                        would stress that if we did not act to meet the Soviet threat in Southwest
                        Asia, a fundamental tipping of history would occur. <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> all
                        had said that they more or less concurred with our strategic assessment, but
                        it was important to get their collective agreement at Venice to our view of
                        the implications of Afghanistan. If we could do that, the individual
                        measures we had proposed would then be easier to achieve. Therefore, the
                        President should make a tough-minded, forceful statement at Venice.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">A report on the June 22–23 Venice Economic Summit
                            is printed in <ref target="frus1977-80v03#d247"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1977–1980, vol. III, Foreign Economic
                                Policy, Document 247</ref>. On June 22, the participants at the
                            Summit issued a statement on Afghanistan that called for “a world in
                            which the rule of law is universally obeyed, national independence is
                            respected and world peace is kept.” The statement continued: “We
                            therefore reaffirm hereby that the Soviet military occupation of
                            Afghanistan is unacceptable now and that we are determined not to accept
                            it in the future. It is incompatible with the will of the Afghan people
                            for national independence, as demonstrated by their courageous
                            resistance, and with the security of the states of the region. It is
                            also incompatible with the principles of the United Nations Charter and
                            with efforts to maintain genuine détente. It undermines the very
                            foundations of peace, both in the region and in the world at large.” The

                                <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> observed that if
                        we fell back from any of our efforts so far to apply punitive measures
                        against the Soviets, we would inevitably have reduced in European eyes the
                        urgency of our evaluation of the crisis and made it easier for them to
                        minimize their own contributions in meeting the crisis. He thought the
                        President should make a statement in Venice in a way to force the Allies to
                        face up to the issue. The President should ask whether the Allies agreed
                        with our strategic evaluation or not. <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> agreed and said that
                        it was important to set a higher standard for European action than we
                        thought they could probably meet. This would show <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> leadership and also realistically recognize that we had to
                        ask for more in order to get the minimally acceptable. (S)</p>
                    <p>In beginning to go through the individual measures we had pursued relating to
                        Afghanistan, <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> asked <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BR_3">Bergland</persName></hi> to address the issue of
                        the grain embargo. <persName corresp="#p_BR_3">Bergland</persName> observed
                        that this matter would be decided by something over which we had no
                        control—weather. If the Soviet Union could harvest 225 metric tons of grain
                        this year, it could muddle through with minimal grain imports whatever we
                        did. We would not know until late June or July how the Soviet crop would
                        turn out. <hi rend="italic">Under Secretary Hathaway</hi> added that
                        Argentina would not cooperate with us in this endeavor and that the key to
                        holding at last year’s export level to the Soviet Union was Canada. If
                        Canada cooperated with us, Australia would follow. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Hathaway</hi> stressed that in order to gain Canadian
                        cooperation, Presidential intervention would be necessary. The Canadian
                        bureaucracy was dead set against our approach. In stressing that the Allies
                        were generally against us on this matter, <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_OHD_1">Henry Owen</persName></hi> said that the chances
                        of Canadian cooperation were less than 50–50. Moreover, if the Soviets had
                        an average crop year, our efforts to reduce grain exports would not make
                        much difference anyway. In any case, the Canadians would make a decision on
                        this issue in the next week or so and if we intervened, it would have to be
                        soon. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BR_3">Bergland</persName></hi>
                        agreed and stressed we had only two alternatives—to pressure the Canadians
                        or to abandon this effort altogether. He thought the Canadians could be
                        pressured but we must act now. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi>, observing that this issue
                        was a centerpiece of our post-Afghanistan measures, said if we dropped it
                        this would signal to the Europeans and the Soviets that we were in effect
                        dropping our anti-Afghanistan effort. We would be saying that the problem
                        was too tough. That would be perceived abroad as a relaxation of our
                        determination to respond to the Soviet invasion. <hi rend="italic">Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> agreed and
                        said that we had no choice except to go to the Canadians. It would be better
                        to fail because Ottawa did not agree than to drop the effort ourselves. The
                        consensus at the table was thus that talking points should be urgently

                    <p>Noting that the Allied response to our efforts to restrain export credits to

                        tactically we should continue to pressure the Europeans on credits even
                        though we knew we would not get their complete cooperation. To do otherwise
                        would send the wrong message to the Allies. At the same time, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> stressed that we should keep
                        our efforts private since we did not wish to inflate this matter publicly to
                        a point at which our lack of success became a public defeat for the
                        President. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> registered the participants’ agreement that
                        we should continue to push the Europeans on credits. (S)</p>
                    <p>Moving on to <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>, <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName></hi> emphasized that
                        this issue had long-range strategic implications and that we should press
                        the Europeans hard. The <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss></hi> agreed. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> thought reduced technology
                        transfer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> had the greatest
                        potential for giving pain to the Soviets over time. The group thought that
                        we should do our best to expand the <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss>
                        list, recognizing that the Europeans would resist. Again, all concurred that
                        this should not be a matter for public discussion. (S)</p>
                    <p>On the Olympics, it was agreed that we should send messages this week to
                        ensure that there is no slippage among those who had already decided not to
                        go to the Olympics and to try to persuade individual federations not to
                        attend the Moscow Games. Near the time of the Moscow Games, we should also
                        emphasize to those who would be attending that we hoped they would insist on
                        reduced ceremonies (no flags, anthems, etc.) at Moscow. <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> suggested
                        that we try to think of ways to give more credit to those governments which
                        would not be going to the Olympics. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> agreed, and thought
                        perhaps the Senate might do something in this respect, as might the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and public groups in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName></hi>
                        wondered whether we might schedule bilateral games—track with the Kenyans,
                        swimming with the Australians, and the like—and it was agreed that these
                        suggestions would be followed-up. (S)</p>
                    <p>On the remaining issues before the group, it was agreed that we should make
                        clear to the Allies that, aside from political-level contacts, we intended
                        to maintain our basic practice of minimal contacts with the Soviets and
                        hoped they will do the same; <hi rend="italic">State</hi> promised an
                        options paper on the issue of debt relief for Pakistan; and all thought it
                        would <pb n="752" facs="0797" xml:id="pg_752"/>be useful to press the Allies
                        harder on the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense response to
                        Afghanistan, especially the Belgians and Dutch who were apparently not going
                        to make their three percent defense commitment. (S)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                        then reminded the participants that the President had endorsed the following
                        division of labor concepts for coordinating <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Allied contributions to the security of the Persian
                        Gulf region:</p>
                    <p>1. Most important is that our Allies increase their commitments to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s defense. This is the greatest
                        contribution they can make while the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is
                        building a security system for the Persian Gulf region. (S)</p>
                    <p>2. Facilitating <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> enroute access for
                        military contingencies in the region is the next most helpful thing the
                        Allies can contribute. They should be pressed to provide that access.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>3. On military exercises and deployments, we should encourage our Allies to
                        go through with those they have already planned but not to do more at this
                        time. (S)</p>
                    <p>4. We should encourage the British, French, and Australians to improve their
                        rapid deployment capabilities, but we should not encourage them to go beyond
                        their current plan. (S)</p>
                    <p>5. We should encourage the Allies to expand their security assistance to key
                        regional countries, particularly Turkey, but also Oman, Somalia, Djibouti,
                        and Sudan. We should encourage them to maintain at least the same level of
                        economic aid to Egypt, Turkey, and Pakistan and to expand economic aid with
                        the smaller countries in the region. (S)</p>
                    <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> observed that
                        another matter of transatlantic concern in the next months was <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_CDE_1">CDE</gloss>. It was agreed that there would be a follow-on to this
                        meeting next week which would discuss how this issue might affect our
                        relations with the Allies and, if required, what steps we should take after
                        the President’s call to Trudeau on Canadian grain exports.<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">At the bottom of the memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> wrote: “We must <hi rend="italic">convince</hi> the Allies that there will be no

                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>Intensifying infighting between the Khalq and Parcham factions of the
                        People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) is significantly complicating efforts to legitimize and
                        popularize the Soviet puppet <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> regime. The struggle has its roots in early personal
                        and ideological differences, greatly exacerbated by the events of the two
                        years since the April 1978 coup, which brought the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss> to power in Afghanistan. Should the present uneasy truce
                        continue to erode, there could be another major upheaval in the Afghan
                        political scene. Already, reports abound that each group is plotting to
                        unseat the other.</p>
                    <p>The situation presents the Soviets with a dilemma. The continuing feud is
                        paralyzing government operations and strengthening the ranks of the
                        countrywide resistance. But if the Soviets should espouse the cause of one
                        faction to the exclusion of the other, they could further undermine their
                        own base of support. While neither faction could remain in power without
                        Soviet backing, keeping the peace between them may prove to be a goal beyond
                        the Soviet reach.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Importance of a United <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss></p>
                    <p>The government installed by the Soviets after their December 27 invasion
                        signaled a reuniting of Khalqis and Parchamis under the leadership of
                        long-time Parcham head, now President, Prime Minister, and Secretary General
                        of the <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>. The government is a carefully contrived mix
                        of Khalqis and Parchamis. There are two Deputy Prime Ministers—one a Khalqi,
                        Assadullah Sarwari, and the other a Parchami, Sultan Ali Keshtmand. The
                        dominant Parcham faction outnumbers the Khalq in all the government and
                        party organizations—but only by a margin of four to three in the important
                        Politburo.</p>
                    <p>Collaboration between the two groups, functioning as a united <gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>, is important from the Soviet viewpoint
                        for two reasons. First, it confers legitimacy on <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>, the Soviet puppet, as a natural successor to
                        the previous Khalq regimes of <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Nur Mohammad
                            Taraki</persName>
                        <pb n="754" facs="0799" xml:id="pg_754"/>and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Hafizullah Amin</persName> and supports the claim that this is merely a
                        new phase in the natural evolution of the Saur (April) revolution. Second,
                        it helps establish as broad-based a political appeal as possible. The Soviet
                        Union gambled that Babrak would appear more politically attractive than his
                        predecessors and that it could effect a reconciliation between the estranged
                        Khalqis and Parchamis which would provide a base on which to build a broader
                        national front. The building of such a front is considered essential for
                        overcoming the present widespread hostility to the succession of Marxist
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets also apparently believed that the 85,000 troops they brought into
                        Afghanistan to support Babrak would quickly discourage the countrywide
                        opposition to the government, thus giving it time and breathing space to
                        become established and to win support with conciliatory programs. To date,
                        most of the Soviets’ original judgments appear to have been in error. The
                        overwhelming popular resistance, which has grown appreciably since the
                        December invasion and is now directed primarily against the Soviets
                        themselves, makes a mockery of any claim to legitimacy. Likewise, the
                        deep-seated hostility between the Parcham and Khalq factions is proving to
                        be irreconcilable.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Early Stages of Rivalry</p>
                    <p>The rivalry between the Khalqis and the Parchamis has its roots in an early
                        split in the Communist-styled People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan when
                        Babrak led a splinter group out of the party in 1967, two years after it was
                        founded by <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. The present
                        organization was then known popularly as the Khalq party after the name of
                        its short-lived publication <hi rend="italic">Khalq</hi> (“The Masses” or
                        “The People”) and the Babrak group became known as the Parcham (“Banner”)
                        party from the name of its paper.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for the original split appear to have been more personal than
                        ideological as both groups were dedicated to the principles of
                        Marxism-Leninism. However, certain philosophical and policy differences
                        separated them from the beginning and are important factors in the current
                        struggle. The Parchamis have always been considered closer to Moscow than
                        the more independent Khalqis. This is currently symbolized by the Parchamis’
                        blatant status as a Soviet puppet. Also, the Parchamis have consistently
                        been more pragmatic and have favored temporary alliances with progressive
                        movements as an intermediate step on the path to socialism, whereas the
                        Khalqis have favored class struggle and a hard line. This approach led the
                        Parchamis to team up with Mohammad Daoud for the coup against his cousin,
                        King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM_1">Zahir</persName>, in July 1973 and for the
                        early stages of his Presidency.<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">See <ref target="frus1969-76ve08#d4"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        gradual approach to political, social, and economic change in order to
                        appease the inflamed populace. This policy appears to have the full support
                        of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Recruitment and organization patterns also differed from the beginning of the
                        Afghan leftist movement and are important factors in the present conflict.
                        The Parchamis, although more in the public eye because of the dynamism of
                        Babrak, were a relatively small and loosely organized group. They were
                        intellectuals drawing their support from the urban middle class,
                        professionals, and students and have been described as Afghanistan’s
                        “Communist Aristocracy.”</p>
                    <p>The Khalq group stayed more in the background, but eventually came to be much
                        larger and much better organized than the Parchamis. It recruited primarily
                        among the civil service, the military establishment, and in the countryside.
                        It was also considered to be more Pushtun-dominated than the Parcham party,
                        which, although smaller, reputedly had a broader ethnic base. One member of
                        the Khalq inner circle who was a particularly effective organizer and had
                        special responsibility for recruiting in the military was <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>No official current membership figures are available. According to a recent
                        Reuters article from Kabul, there are an estimated 25,000–50,000 Khalqis,
                        while it is believed there were fewer than 10,000 Parchamis at the time of
                        the December coup. These figures give a sense of relative size. They may
                        have been valid for an earlier period, but in light of overwhelming current
                        alienation, they are probably highly inflated.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Feuding Intensified After Successful 1978 Coup</p>
                    <p>The predominant cause for the current hostility lies in the events of the
                        past two years after the Khalq and Parcham groups, having reunited in 1977
                        following 10 years of estrangement, jointly overthrew President Mohammad
                        Daoud in April 1978.</p>
                    <p>The unity which brought them to power proved to be short-lived. The Khalqis
                        quickly outmaneuvered the Parcham group and forced Babrak and his closest
                        associates first into diplomatic exile as ambassadors in July 1978 and later
                        into real exile, when they were dismissed from their posts. Other
                        high-ranking Parchamis suffered an even more disagreeable fate in the summer
                        of 1978 when they were accused of plotting against the government,
                        imprisoned, and tortured. During the course of the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> regimes, most of the Parcham leadership and hundreds of
                        lower ranking members were imprisoned.</p>
                    <p>When the Soviets invaded in December 1979 and overthrew <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, who had won out in a power struggle
                        with the subsequently murdered <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>, they brought the exiled Parcham leadership group
                        with them and reinstated it as the dominant element in the new government.
                        All other Parchamis were subsequently released from imprisonment.</p>
                    <p><pb n="756" facs="0801" xml:id="pg_756"/>Against this background, it is
                        understandable that the current attempts to reconcile past differences are
                        not succeeding. Parchamis who suffered torture from their current Khalq
                        colleagues cannot forget and forgive. One of the most hated figures is
                        Khalqi Deputy Prime Minister Assadullah Sarwari, who was head of the secret
                        police during the <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> presidency
                        and who is held personally responsible for the torture of some of the
                        Parcham political prisoners, including the other Deputy Prime Minister,
                        Sultan Ali Keshtmand.</p>
                    <p>Current reports indicate a good deal of maneuvering by each group to
                        discredit and hopefully eliminate the other. The differences are now
                        becoming so acute that they are breaking out into the open and are being
                        reported in the press with increasing frequency. Recently a prominent
                        Parchami newspaper editor, who is a younger brother of Parchami Deputy Prime
                        Minister Keshtmand, was arrested after his paper ran an article and a
                        cartoon critical of former President <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>. While former President <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> is now treated as an aberrant and responsible for all
                        the mistakes and suppression of the past two years, <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> is still honored and the Khalqis in
                        the present government are loyal to him.</p>
                    <p>The Khalq faction is apparently opposed to the current Parcham policy, which
                        emphasizes moderation and a respect for Islam designed to placate the
                        hostile populace. The Khalqis reportedly were particularly opposed to
                        issuing the new, less inflammatory flag.</p>
                    <p>Most important of all, it has been reported by the Press Trust of India
                        correspondent in Kabul that the recently signed Afghan-Soviet treaty
                        covering the status of Soviet troops in Afghanistan has caused sharp
                        divisions within the government and the party. Khalqis are now said to be
                        increasingly opposed to the continued presence of Soviet troops.</p>
                    <p>On the surface it might appear to be in the Soviets’ interests to dispense
                        with the Khalq faction altogether and rely solely on the more amenable and
                        beholden Parchamis. However, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> has failed to win popular support and strongman Khalqi
                        Assadullah Sarwari is said to be a Soviet favorite. Even more important, the
                        superior numerical strength of the Khalq group, and particularly its
                        strength in the military, makes this a less appealing option. If the Khalqis
                        were to go over to the resistance <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, it would
                        make the Soviets’ job of pacification even more difficult than it already
                        is.</p>
                    <p>Some lower ranking Khalqis may already be joining the resistance ranks,
                        however, and it certainly appears that the Soviets will find it increasingly
                        difficult to keep the lid on the explosive feuding.</p>

                            Rhodesia’s independence, gave a press conference April 17, during which
                            he called on the United States to pursue a stronger military response to
                            the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. (Carlyle Murphy, “Pakistan Calls

                            Congressman Wolff, who led a congressional delegation to Pakistan, met
                            with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> in Islamabad June 1. The

                            countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">See <ref target="#d272">Document

                    <p>It is the position of the United States that any viable solution to the
                        problem of Afghanistan must be based on the principles of non-intervention
                        and non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign nations.
                        Accordingly, with the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet forces from
                        Afghanistan, the United States will be prepared to join in assurances and
                        arrangements to establish a truly independent and non-aligned Afghanistan,
                        administered by a government acceptable to the Afghan people.</p>
                    <p>The United States has no interest in interfering in Afghanistan’s internal
                        affairs. We will not endorse arrangements designed to perpetuate a
                        government imposed upon Afghanistan through foreign arms. Nor could we agree
                        to conditions which affect adversely our own vital interests in the area or
                        those of Afghanistan’s neighbors.</p>
                    <p>If the foregoing approach is accepted by the Soviet Union, the United States
                        would be prepared to explore some transitional arrangement, to be
                        implemented along with the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet troops from
                        Afghanistan, for the purpose of ensuring that peace and tranquillity are
                        restored in Afghanistan. The creation of an international peacekeeping force
                        could be considered in this connection.</p>
                    <p><pb n="760" facs="0805" xml:id="pg_760"/>It is the US view that a solution
                        based on such principles would facilitate the restoration of more
                        cooperative relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>1. The security situation throughout Afghanistan continues to deteriorate.
                        Main roads leading south and east out of Kabul city are being interdicted by
                        the Islamic nationalist insurgents (<gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>).
                        The Afghan military continues to experience desertions, and recruiting
                        drives have been unsuccessful. Kabul city has become the scene of repeated
                        assassinations and other terrorist acts. The population of the city appears
                        to be almost totally disaffected from the regime, and there is the potential
                        for serious civil disturbances. Kandahar, Jalalabad, and Herat are contested
                        cities with the government on the defensive. In these latter cities, party
                        workers continue to be attacked and killed. The Afghan military <pb n="761" facs="0806" xml:id="pg_761"/>officers corps is coming under increasing
                        pressure by the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>. Officers are now being
                        targeted for assassination throughout the country, including attempted
                        attacks on senior officers in Kabul. Reports indicate that the morale of the
                        Afghan military is crumbling. The Parchamist clique and the Khalqi clique of
                        the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (<gloss target="#t_PDPA_1">PDPA</gloss>) are attacking each other and are in turn attacked by the
                            <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>. Party workers live in constant
                        fear for their lives in Kandahar, Jalalabad, and Herat; this pattern is
                        beginning in Kabul. Mazar-i-Sharif is not as chaotic, but the situation in
                        that city is also tense.</p>
                    <p>2. Afghan Army units are operating in the field, but with decreasing
                        competence. Increasingly, the Soviet forces have been called on to rout the
                            <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> from strongholds they occupy.
                        Soviet attacks on the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> have been
                        militarily successful. The Soviets are taking losses, probably at a much
                        higher level than they originally anticipated. But when the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> elects to confront the Soviets in static
                        battles, the Soviets prevail. When the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>
                        has resorted to more classical guerrilla tactics, they have inflicted
                        significant losses on the Soviets. Ambushes, minings and assassinations by
                        the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> are taking a steady toll of Soviet
                        forces. Once the Soviets leave an area from which they have cleared the
                            <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>, the insurgents successfully
                        reinfiltrate and cause the returning Afghan Army units considerable grief.
                        The lesson the Soviets must be learning is that if they plan to control an
                        area, they must keep Soviet forces there because the Afghan military cannot
                        handle the job. This leads to the conclusion that the Soviets will have to
                        increase their overall strength levels inside Afghanistan and be prepared to
                        become even more overtly an army of occupation.</p>
                    <p>Regime’s forces.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>, while demonstrating
                        sophistication in guerrilla tactics, remain disunited and unable to
                        coordinate their sometimes effective actions against the regime and the
                        Soviets. There appears to be little coordination among the groups in
                        Peshawar and those doing the actual fighting; and there appears to be little
                        coordination within Afghanistan among the groups doing the fighting.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> continue to make good use of the
                        weapons available to them. The average <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>
                        soldier is deadly when using an Enfield 303. The <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> have been making good use of mines and anti-tank weapons
                        against both the Soviets and the Afghan regime forces. During the last
                        several weeks, there have been confirmed reports that the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> have successfully shot down Soviet MI–8
                        and MI–24 helicopters with conventional arms.<note n="2" xml:id="d285fn2">An
                            unknown hand underlined “conventional arms.”</note> The MI–24 gunship
                        helicopter has been particularly harmful to the insurgents, however, and it
                        has proved to be a difficult <pb n="762" facs="0807" xml:id="pg_762"/>weapon
                        to destroy in the air by conventional anti-aircraft weapons. If the
                        insurgents can work out a way to destroy MI–24s with some regularity, there
                        is the possibility that the Soviets’ effective use of this weapon can be
                        curtailed.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviets have been increasingly barbarous in their responses to <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> attacks. There are several reports that
                        the Soviets have killed tribal non-combatants and destroyed villages in
                        areas the Soviets see as still hostile. More of this kind of reprisal is
                        beginning to develop and it appears that village destruction, as
                        retaliation, may be Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviets appear to be trying to seal the borders of Afghanistan. When
                        Soviet troops are in the border areas, they appear to be relatively
                        successful in this effort. They can only continue to prevent the movement of
                        most supplies across borders, however, by committing additional men so that
                        they have a permanent force in the border areas. Even with an increase in
                        manpower, the total prevention of cross-border infiltration from Iran and
                        Pakistan will be possible.</p>
                    <p>7. This has been the wettest spring in Afghanistan in twenty years. The rains
                        were to the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>’s advantage. The wet
                        weather was almost immediately followed by hot weather in the plains.
                        Because of the altitude of most of Afghanistan, the dust and the heat,
                        helicopter operations are difficult in the summer months. Thus, because of
                        weather, the Soviets have not been able to fully utilize this equipment
                        which gives them an advantage. The Soviets are behind schedule in their
                        pacification operations, we believe, because of these weather factors and
                        their miscalculation of the intensity of the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>’s resistance. We have not seen signs that the Soviets have
                        decided to discontinue their pacification plans; rather they have repeatedly
                        gone back into several areas on search and destroy missions where resistance
                        has reemerged.</p>
                    <p>8. There appears to be little likelihood that the Soviets will agree to a
                        political settlement which includes their withdrawal because if they
                        withdraw, the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> regime
                        will fall and chaos will follow. For the Soviet side, there is nothing to be
                        gained by a withdrawal. The situation would not return to pre-1975; the
                        regime would be destroyed; the Soviets would be isolated from any new
                        government; and the new government would probably be a fundamentalist
                        Islamic government. There is no indication that a compromise government
                        acceptable to both the Soviets and the various factions in the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> could be constituted. The positions of the
                        opposing sides are too divergent at this time; therefore, the Soviets’ only
                        course of action is to destroy the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>
                        forces in the field. A military victory in the field will alleviate the need
                        for a political solution. It is not possible for the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> to defeat the Soviets; rather the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> can only hope to conserve their forces’
                        while continuing to make the Soviet forces’ situation difficult and painful.
                        To date, the Soviets have not taken unacceptable heavy casualties, <pb n="763" facs="0808" xml:id="pg_763"/>relative to their manpower pool and
                        equipment resources. Probably the most painful element has been that the
                        Soviets’ pride has been badly hurt. The Red Army is being hit hard by bands
                        of irregulars and we doubt if the Soviets considered it possible that such
                        groups could operate so successfully against their forces.</p>
                    <p>9. Given the resources the two sides have at their command, it seems probable
                        that the Soviets will prevail, but the cost will be higher than they
                        calculated both in military and political terms. The longer it drags out,
                        the more painful it becomes for the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>10. Chargé’s comments: I agree entirely with this appraisal’s description of
                        the current situation in Afghanistan (paras. 1–7) and with the general
                        thrust of paras. 8 and 9. However, I am a little more optimistic than the
                            <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss> that the Soviets can eventually be
                        brought to the point where totally destroying the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> forces is not their “only course of action.” If the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss> can keep enough pressure on the Soviets
                        for a long enough period of time, and if in the meantime the Soviet
                        diplomatic offensive to bring about acceptance of the status quo can be made
                        to fail, the Soviets might reach the point where a compromise solution seems
                        more attractive to them than an endless continuation of the blood-letting.
                        This will probably require that the <gloss target="#t_INI_1">INI</gloss>
                        receive more and better military equipment from the outside than it is now
                        getting, and that carries with it the chance that the Soviets might lash out
                        in frustration at Pakistan, Iran or indirectly at the other “aggressors,”
                        including this Embassy.</p>
                    <p>If the point is eventually reached when the Soviets are ready for a genuine
                        compromise solution, I do not believe their prospects are quite as bleak as
                        para. 9 implies. It is not a given, for instance, that “the Soviets would be
                        isolated from any new government;” <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName> and other resistance leaders have publicly
                        acknowledged that any Kabul government would have to be on good terms with
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Through tribal manipulation and
                        bribery, the Soviets could probably ensure that someone minimally acceptable

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>There are a number of proposals being floated for a political solution to the
                        Afghan problem. While the Soviets do not seem seriously interested now, we
                        think it worthwhile to keep alive proposals which are broadly consistent
                        with our own views. Tactically, we recommend that in the weeks immediately
                        ahead we focus attention on the Islamic Conference initiative and encourage
                        the Europeans to do likewise. The purpose of this memorandum is to obtain
                        your approval for a positive approach to the Islamic Conference Committee
                        and your guidance on the posture we should take with our allies as we
                        prepare for the Venice Summit.</p>

                    <p>1. Your approval of the attached cable informing members of the Islamic
                        Committee other than <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> of
                        the approach contained in your letter to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>, expressing interest in the Islamic Conference
                        initiative, and suggesting that you would be prepared to meet with the
                        Pakistani Foreign Minister if he comes to New York. (The approach would also
                        be conveyed to the Indians and Chinese.)<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">The

                            Beijing, June 12. The telegram informed the posts that Department
                            officials had notified the Soviet Union of the latest <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views on the Afghanistan issue. The
                            Department instructed the Ambassadors to convey the following points: 1)
                            a viable settlement in Afghanistan required the withdrawal of the Soviet
                            military, after which the United States would be prepared to help
                            “establish a truly independent and non-aligned Afghanistan;” 2) the
                            United States “has no interest in interfering with Afghanistan’s
                            internal affairs;” 3) the United States is “prepared to explore some
                            transitional arrangement, to be implemented along with the prompt
                            withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan, for the purpose of
                            ensuring that peace and tranquility are restored in Afghanistan;” and 4)
                            a settlement in Afghanistan would “facilitate the restoration of more
                            cooperative relations between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                        preparing for Venice, we seek to encourage the Europeans to focus their
                        efforts on the Islamic Conference Committee rather than push competing
                        proposals of their own in their contacts with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>3. Your consideration of a recommendation to instruct Swiss Ambassador Lang
                        to convey to <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> in more

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <p>There are several initiatives, contemplated or underway, designed to advance
                        a political solution for the Afghan problem. <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Tom Watson</persName> will shortly be delivering your letter to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">See <ref target="#d284">Document 284</ref>.</note> The
                        Islamic Conference Committee (Pakistan, Iran and Islamic Conference
                        Secretary General Chatti) has been meeting in Tehran to formulate their
                        approach. <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> will be going to
                        Moscow and will be discussing Afghanistan. The British are continuing their
                        dialogue in Moscow despite public Soviet rebuffs and could be slightly
                        softening their position.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are evidently not prepared at this time seriously to consider a
                        solution which involves their early and total withdrawal from Afghanistan.
                        On the contrary, the Soviets are seeking to turn the notion of a political
                        solution to their own advantage in an effort to gain recognition of the
                        Kabul regime, to divide the allies and soften Third World condemnation.
                        Nevertheless, there is value in keeping alive the idea of an acceptable
                        political solution in order to keep the door open should the Soviets wish to
                        withdraw from Afghanistan and in the meantime keep them on the defensive
                        politically. The allies place particular importance on this tactic.</p>
                    <p><pb n="766" facs="0811" xml:id="pg_766"/>Your letter to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> clearly keeps the door open and
                        lays out our basic conditions for a solution. At this stage, we think our
                        allies should be encouraged to help to shape and encourage the Islamic
                        initiative rather than proposing their own variants which the Soviets can
                        pick and choose among in an effort to escape pressure for withdrawal. The
                        allies are generally sympathetic to the Islamic Conference Committee’s
                        initiative. We have already encouraged the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> to discuss the Islamic initiative with <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>, who will be visiting Bonn next
                        week.</p>
                    <p>The Committee’s terms of reference are quite close to our own principles,
                        although we cannot be certain how the Committee will proceed in its work and
                        we will certainly have no control over it. There is, however, a good bit of
                        value in having the Soviets confront an Islamic initiative. The Committee
                        may build a record of Soviet intransigence which we could point to later,
                        particularly in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>. However, you
                        should be aware that according to press reports on June 7, the Committee has
                        authorized Chatti to ascertain the views of the Soviets, Afghan authorities
                        and resistance leaders regarding a political solution.</p>
                    <p>We have not made known our attitude toward the Committee. A public embrace
                        would probably be unwelcome and counterproductive. Unpublicized contact,
                        however, could be useful in indicating our support and perhaps even
                        influencing the process of negotiation.</p>
                    <p>The President has authorized us to convey to the Islamic Committee members
                        the approach contained in your letter to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>. We propose in addition to express our interest in
                        the work of the Committee and our hope that we could quietly stay in touch
                        at least with Chatti and Pakistan Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>. In this connection, we suggest
                        that we tell <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> that you would
                        welcome an early opportunity to exchange views with him on Afghanistan.
                            (<persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> may be coming to a meeting
                        at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in the next few weeks and could
                        come down to Washington for a brief undramatized meeting.) Such a meeting
                        would give you an opportunity to brief <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> on your conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>, provide an assessment of Soviet intentions and
                        other initiatives for a political solution, and exchange views on the
                        Islamic Committee’s work. The meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> could also have a collateral benefit in terms of our
                        bilateral relations with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we realize that <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> is
                        in a different category from Chatti and <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName>, but we think there is some advantage in giving
                        recognition to the important role <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> has played in this issue and the parallelism of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Iranian interests on
                        Afghanistan. Since <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> is the
                        Iranian official working most vigorously for release of the hostages, to
                        establish this common interest could have some benefits for us.</p>

                        during a specified period, often with a breakdown by individual unit.
                        Although incomplete, these data indicate that Soviet military forces
                        suffered at least 2,031 casualties—771 killed and 1,260 wounded and
                        injured—between late December and mid-May. Among individual ground units

                        during this period were as low as 2 percent but generally approached 5

                        provide details of how and when casualties occurred—for example, that 120

                        25 Soviets were killed in one part of Kabul during the demonstrations in
                        late February; and that 17 Soviets were killed on 16 or 17 May in a
                        firefight between Afghan and Soviet soldiers around Pol-i-Charkhi prison.
                        These and numerous other similar reports raise the possibility that total
                        Soviet casualties in Afghanistan may be two or three times higher than the

                        <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has ordered approximately $30 million
                        worth of equipment of Soviet origin delivering it at a rate controlled by
                        Pakistan’s ability to absorb and distribute it. Approximately $10 million
                        worth of arms have been distributed through Pakistan to the Afghans. The
                        remaining $20 million worth will be delivered prior to 30 September 1980.
                        The attachment lists the weapons delivered and those still in the
                        pipeline.</p>
                    <p>2. The delivery mechanism involves five nationalities. The arms originate in

                        Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where they are transferred to Saudi Air Force C–130’s
                        for delivery to Islamabad, Pakistan. Finally, the arms are sent into
                        Afghanistan by the Pakistanis primarily through eight Afghan exile
                        organizations headquartered in Peshawar. Until recently the Pakistani
                        distribution mechanism could only absorb one C–130 load approximately every
                        five days. The Pakistanis now are able to distribute the material more
                        quickly. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> will supplement the existing
                        mechanism with direct C–141 Cairo-Islamabad flights. This will represent
                        about a 40 percent increase in delivery. Supplementary delivery systems via

                        extremely sensitive to this program. The Saudis have commented favorably on

                        mentioned in any press leak. The Pakistanis are less pleased because they
                        have been mentioned. We have committed to them to protect the security of
                        the program. We have generally briefed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                            origin, and were funneled through Pakistan; and that the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration rejected plans
                            to supply the Afghan rebels with more sophisticated weaponry due to the

                        Freedom Fighters is an extremely sensitive subject. Our Saudi and Pakistani
                        partners have made it clear that their continued participation is contingent
                        upon the program being kept secret. Periodic leaks in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> press about the Afghan covert action
                        program invariably produce questions from the Paks and Saudis. In response,
                        we can only explain the role of the press in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> society.</p>

                        elevates the problem to a new plane. Despite our denials, the Pakistanis and
                        Saudis will probably conclude that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        policy is to surface the Afghan support program. It should be understood
                        that any further broadcasting over <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                        in Afghanistan can result in the termination of the program.</p>
                    <p>4. Such official broadcasts also increase the risk that Afghan terrorists

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> had originally
                        requested the meeting before the Vienna meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> but, because of the press of
                        business, it had been deferred until today.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had been disappointed with the reply <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> had given <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> to his (<persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>’s) letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">See <ref target="#d284">Document 284</ref>.</note> The
                        reply had not been as responsive as we had expected, perhaps because it had
                        been given “off the cuff” on first reading. The Secretary expressed the hope
                        that <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> would digest the letter
                        more thoroughly, and might then <pb n="774" facs="0819" xml:id="pg_774"/>be
                        in a position to give a more detailed response to some of the elements in
                        the letter.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to mention two points in particular which concerned him
                        in the report of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s reply:
                        (1) we continue to have difficulty with the Soviet view that the principal
                        aggression comes from Pakistan. It remains our view that the principal
                        aggression is that created by the Soviet invasion. In any case, we would
                        like to see both the Soviet aggression and any intervention from abroad
                        brought to an end. (2) <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>
                        emphasized at length his objection to what he apparently understood the
                        letter to suggest, that a government should be established in Afghanistan
                        acceptable to the neighbors of that country. This was a misunderstanding:
                        what the letter said was that a government should be set up in Kabul which
                        was acceptable to the people of Afghanistan. He added that this could be
                        done “with the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan,”
                        emphasizing that the word “with” had been carefully chosen.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> asked how the word “with” was
                        to be understood, and whether it could be a significant departure from the
                        word “prior,” which he had understood to represent the US position. The
                        Secretary replied that this could be a matter for discussion. [In view of
                        the problem of translating “with,” which had arisen at the <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName> conversation, <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> was asked what Russian word had been used in the
                        copy of the letter sent to him by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He
                        replied: “nariadu s,” which conveys the proper sense of simultaneity.]<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">Brackets are in the original.</note></p>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized forcefully that so long as Soviet troops continued
                        to occupy Afghanistan, this fact would continue to be a matter that affected
                        our vital interests, and it would also be a barrier to the establishment of
                        an independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. His letter, he said, had been
                        worked out carefully with the President in the hope that it would open the
                        way to a solution of the problem that would meet both Soviet and American
                        interests fairly, and would remove this unfortunate and dangerous
                        problem.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought a solution
                        could be found which would meet both Soviet and American security
                        interests.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> had asked him to obtain any
                        further clarification possible on what the American side had in mind in
                        referring to “some transitional arrangement.” The Secretary replied that he
                        had reference to the point in this regard which the President had made at
                        his press conference on Feb. 13;<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4">See <ref target="#d212fn2">footnote 2, Document 212</ref>.</note> he did not

                        detailed a meaning to the term, but to raise a general point which, if
                        accepted, could be worked out in the course of further negotiations. What we
                        were seeking to do, he said, was to find the outside limits within which
                        negotiations might be possible.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> made a further effort in
                        behalf of the Afghan plan.<note n="5" xml:id="d290fn5">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> Why, he asked, could not
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and Babrak sit down together
                        to work things out, as a way of getting things started? The Secretary
                        reviewed the objections previously expressed to the plan, emphasizing that
                        under it, Soviet troops could remain in Afghanistan forever, and this was
                        our main concern.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Subjects</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> said he hoped future
                        negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> could
                        cover a broader range of subjects than Afghanistan. He asked, as an example,
                        whether the US could not find a way of working together with the Soviet
                        Union on Middle East problems, adding that Soviet and American interests
                        were not as far apart in that area as some people seemed to think. He also
                        suggested, on a purely personal basis, that a compromise solution could be
                        found for the <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> issue. In this context,
                        he repeated his regret that no formal answer had been given to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s proposal, other than the
                        decision to proceed with the deployment. The Secretary probed to see whether
                            <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> was implying that the
                        Soviet Union was prepared to postpone its theater deployments, but <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that this was his
                        personal view, and no more. Both agreed, however, that the Afghanistan issue
                        was an unfortunate barrier to the resolution of many issues between the two
                        countries.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I will be doing a full trip report shortly,<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">The
                            full trip report was not found.</note> but want to fill you in on a few
                        points of particular interest on the covert side. (S)</p>
                    <p>I got an (apparently) good and candid briefing from the Station Chief in
                        Islamabad. He is very satisfied with the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> performance now; the earlier bottlenecks have been
                        dissolved and now the Paks are prepared to pass through more equipment than
                        we can get to them. The <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss> claims that he
                        has several unilateral sources who confirm that the Paks are telling him
                        pretty much the truth. (It is noteworthy, though, that the Paks tell him
                        very little. They hold this entire operation extremely closely and I am
                        impressed by their ability to keep it all secret. Wish we could do as well.)
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>On the SA–7: There are two launchers and (I believe) 15 missiles in country,
                        headed for the Kabul area. The Paks insisted that they <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be used, initially at least, in areas near Pakistan since that
                        would be too obvious and provocative. That is understandable but
                        unfortunate, since the border area is where they are needed most. If things
                        go well, we should soon be hearing of mysterious downing of aircraft. There
                        is no report-back capability from the people who have the SAMs; we will have
                        to read it out of battle reports. (S)</p>
                    <p>The Paks are extending the arms flow now to groups operating out of Quetta as
                        well as Peshawar. This is another good step, since the operation should not
                        be too dependent on the faction-ridden Peshawar leadership. (S)</p>
                    <p>Both Afghans and Paks with whom I spoke (and none of the latter at least
                        would have been aware of the operation) commented very favorably on the
                        increased readiness of the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> over the
                        past two months or so to provide assistance to the mujahidin. I don’t know
                        to what extent this represents our involvement, but it is a good sign.

                        about the lack of US support (I was noncommittal) but then said that they
                        did expect to get some SA–7s soon. Word must be seeping out. He also went on

                    <p>The Soviets are currently engaged in an increasingly active campaign to
                        spread the idea that their withdrawal announcement demon<pb n="778" facs="0823" xml:id="pg_778"/>strates a serious interest in a political
                            settlement.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">The Soviet statement on a
                            partial withdrawal from Afghanistan, June 22, made through the official
                            news organ, <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>, was first reported
                            in telegram 9988 from Moscow the same day. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            P900077–1709) An article in the President’s Daily Brief, June 23,
                            asserted that the statement “seems aimed primarily at influencing the

                            explicit on this point and did not discuss the possibility of further
                            withdrawals.” The article further noted that the withdrawing troops,
                            numbering approximately 5,000, were “largely ineffective against the
                            guerillas.” An article in the July 7 President’s Daily Brief surmised
                            that the announcement of the troop withdrawals possibly suggested
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s interest in
                            assuaging domestic critics apprehensive of Soviet Afghan policy.

                        Soviets don’t really want to talk seriously about a political
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>—Embassy Moscow has picked up a story that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> overruled <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> on the withdrawal question.<note n="5" xml:id="d292fn5">The Embassy reported this information in telegram 10147

                    <p>All of these indications are consistent with the interpretation that the
                        Soviet withdrawal is strictly a propaganda move which Moscow hopes to
                        exploit to further divide the US and the West. This interpretation is
                        strongly buttressed by the nature of the Soviet withdrawal and the way they
                        let the French in on the news first.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, there are a few straws in the wind which suggest that there
                        may be more to this than a purely propaganda move.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> appears to be preparing the
                        way for declaring a victory in the style suggested by Senator Aiken for
                        Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s statement that
                        the situation in Afghanistan is returning to normal came at a time when the
                        Soviet security situation in Afghanistan appears worse than ever.<note n="6" xml:id="d292fn6">Speaking at a June 23 meeting of the Central Committee,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> declared: “Life in
                            Afghanistan is now gradually coming back to normal.” A resolution passed
                            by the Central Committee approved the December 1979 intervention in
                            Afghanistan. (Craig R. Whitney, “<persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> Says His Side Won Afghan War,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, p. A6)</note> Whatever his
                        intention, his statement creates the assumption within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> that Soviet involvement is winding
                        down.</p>
                    <p>—Even the kind of phantom withdrawal the Soviets have announced would seem to
                        indicate that they have abandoned one of the options open to them—doubling
                        or tripling of their force in Afghanistan, coupled with a major effort to
                        defeat the Afghan Nationalists throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>—Insignificant though the withdrawal might be, it does create the presumption
                        of a lower overall ceiling and possible further withdrawals. Thus, their
                        action creates new constraints for the future.</p>
                    <p>—It is unlike the Soviets to reverse themselves like this on the withdrawal
                        question. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> told us and the
                        Germans privately that we were wasting our time in talking about withdrawals
                        before there had been recognition of the Babrak government and an end to the
                        Nationalist resistence. He made the same point publicly at a lunch for the
                        Indian Foreign Minister earlier this month.</p>
                    <p>—The fact that the withdrawal announcement was not made a couple of days
                        before the Venice Summit when it might have had more effect on deliberations
                        there would seem to indicate that it was a subject of internal debate and
                        that the opposition was significant. Such a debate <pb n="780" facs="0825" xml:id="pg_780"/>would logically occur in any case before a Plenary
                        meeting of the Party which was called upon to set the line for the next
                        Party Congress in foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>—Embassy Moscow speculates that the uncertainties stemming from US and allied
                        economic countermeasures related to Afghanistan are forcing the delay in
                        producing a new full-year plan as the question on future dependence on
                        technology and food from the West is debated. In the Embassy’s view it is
                        barely conceivable that our actions are having more policy bite than is
                        apparent, and that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> may
                        therefore take his withdrawal initiatives more seriously than is
                            apparent.<note n="7" xml:id="d292fn7">A likely reference to telegram

                    <p>Of course, the Soviets can justify their stated interest in a political
                        settlement by clinging to the May 14 Afghan proposals as they have done so
                        far. But they could have had more success in pursuing this line without any
                        withdrawal announcement, following <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s time-tested pattern of complete inflexibility. The
                        kind of iron-pants strategy is at least as effective in stirring up European
                        doubts about the US as Soviet hints of flexibility.</p>
                    <p>The President’s toast at the Yugoslav State Dinner and subsequent discussion
                        of “transitional” arrangements demonstrate our willingness to discuss a
                        political settlement seriously.<note n="8" xml:id="d292fn8"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> visited Yugoslavia at the

                            withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan, for the purpose of

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s response to the <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> letter is a very authoritative

                    <p>However, the passage in the Resolution of the Party Plenum which comes out
                        for “a political settlement of the situation that has formed around
                        Afghanistan which is pursuing the policy of nonalignment” seems to suggest
                        some flexibility in considering a broadly based arrangement without
                        preconditions or assurances that the gains of the “socialist” revolution
                        there will not be reversed.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, we will presumably be hearing a lot more from the Soviets
                        about the importance of our making a reciprocal gesture such as relaxing
                        some of the post-Afghanistan sanctions. Were we or <pb n="781" facs="0826" xml:id="pg_781"/>our Allies to accommodate them on this, it seems safe
                        to predict that we will hear no more from the Soviets about negotiating a
                        political settlement involving complete withdrawal. If the Soviets are
                        serious, a little stalling on our part should produce additional indications
                        that the Soviets are willing to take the steps which will make real
                        negotiations possible. If not then we will have avoided giving ground in
                        response to a Soviet ploy.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I have carefully read your letter of June 5, which is a continuation of the
                        exchange of views we started in Vienna.<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">See <ref target="#d284">Document 284</ref>.</note> As we agreed at that time
                        the purpose of this exchange is to promote the improvement of Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations, to seek solution on a wide
                        range of bilateral and international problems of mutual interest.</p>
                    <p>Now about the specific problem you raised in your letter: that of
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>As you know, a few days ago we withdrew from Afghanistan, in agreement with
                        the Government of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>, some Soviet
                        military units. It was done in view of the fact that the present situation
                        does not make it necessary to maintain in Afghanistan our military
                        contingent of previous strength.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that the Soviet Union will continue to render
                        necessary assistance to Afghanistan against any action aimed from outside at
                        depriving it of independence and territorial integrity. You must be well
                        aware of that, though, from the report by <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">L.I.

                        adopted by that meeting in connection with the report of the Minister of

                        regard to a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan is that

                        into the Afghan territory, to reach appropriate agreement on normalizing
                        relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, between Afghanistan and Iran,
                        and to guarantee non-recurrence of all forms of outside interference aimed
                        against the Government and the people of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>. It is precisely in this context that the question of
                        withdrawal from Afghanistan of the Soviet military contingent, stationed
                        there to help in repulsing outside aggression, could be also solved.</p>
                    <p>These are the considerations I wish to state in connection with your letter
                        in addition to what has been already said in the conversations with the US
                        Ambassador in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I deem it necessary to stress the following: in order to place
                            Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations into normal
                        tracks, so that they would not be subject to fluctuations of political
                        expediency but develop to the benefit of both our peoples and strengthening
                        peace they cannot be built otherwise than on the basis of equality, mutual
                        respect for each other’s legitimate interests, compliance with agreements
                        already achieved.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leadership has proceeded and intends to proceed in future exactly
                        from this premise. We would like to hope that the US side will also act
                        likewise.</p>

                    <p>Soviet interests abroad have suffered because of the intervention in
                        Afghanistan—and especially the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                        failure to consolidate control. Although things now look better to Moscow
                        than they did a few months ago, the negative reaction to the invasion was
                        greater than the Kremlin anticipated and, though now diminished, remains of
                        considerable concern. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The desire to consolidate control in Afghanistan at any cost may prove
                        overriding, but Moscow has been given important incentives to try to achieve
                        this objective with a minimum of forces. A major escalation that did not
                        produce victory in the field or obtain accommodations to strategic Soviet
                        goals in Southwest Asia would result in further harm to Soviet external
                        interests. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling
                            restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have made several gains and avoided some potential losses:</p>
                    <p>• Moscow has derived comfort from West European desires to maintain a
                        dialogue with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and to avoid
                        heightened tensions in Europe; the significance attributed by US allies to
                        normal trade with the Soviet Union; and the uneven Western support of US
                        policies toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in the wake of
                        the invasion.</p>
                    <p>• In Southwest Asia, Soviet ability to bring pressure on Pakistan and Iran
                        has been enhanced, although neither country has reacted by accommodating
                        Soviet objectives thus far.</p>
                    <p>• India, although distressed by the intervention, shows no present
                        inclination to alter its security ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>; Iraq’s dependence <pb n="784" facs="0829" xml:id="pg_784"/>on Soviet armaments and other aspects of the alliance with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has deterred Baghdad from abrogating the
                        Soviet-Iraqi treaty and normal working relations. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile,
                        has become even more anxious about US capabilities and resolve.</p>
                    <p>• The nonaligned movement has been unable to condemn the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> except implicitly within the forum of
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, Soviet interests have suffered considerable damage:</p>
                    <p>• The political center of gravity in the West has shifted in ways generally
                        adverse to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>; belief in Soviet
                        expansionism has been reconfirmed; openmindedness about Soviet intentions
                        and favorable attitudes about the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are
                        voiced infrequently and receive scant hearing.</p>
                    <p>• US defense efforts have been accelerated, the European allies have pledged
                        to fulfill the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Long-Term Defense Plan
                        more rapidly, and a strong impetus has been given to increased Japanese
                        defense spending and military cooperation with the United States.</p>
                    <p>• The United States has affirmed its readiness to use military force in the
                        Persian Gulf, Western security cooperation with China has increased, and
                        Western willingness to maintain military deployments in the Indian Ocean has
                        been increased. Local opposition to forward US military deployments also has
                        been undermined.</p>
                    <p>• Western economic sanctions have impaired Moscow’s ability to satisfy Soviet
                        consumer demands for meat and dairy products and will probably further
                        retard Soviet efforts to secure sophisticated technology and massive
                        investment credits. Although Western support for the sanctions is eroding,
                        Soviet economic weaknesses have been pointed up anew, both within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and externally.</p>
                    <p>• The Olympic boycott has seriously damaged Moscow’s ability to use the games
                        for propaganda domestically and internationally.</p>
                    <p>• The Kremlin has received uneven support from Eastern Europe, which has felt
                        a strong identity of interests with Western Europe. Moscow has sensed
                        vulnerability and shown less than full control over the Warsaw Pact states
                        and has new reason to doubt the reliability of these allies.</p>
                    <p>• The interests of Cuba and Vietnam have been adversely affected by the
                        Soviet move into Afghanistan, and North Korea has been upset by the
                        invasion. Havana’s international position has been hurt; acceptance of the
                        Heng Samrin regime in Kampuchea has been at least slowed; and relations
                        between Pyongyang and Moscow have become even more strained. The Kremlin is
                        further concerned about the opening it may have afforded the United States
                        for undermining its positions in Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and South
                        Yemen.</p>
                    <p><pb n="785" facs="0830" xml:id="pg_785"/>• Finally, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has tarred itself as an imperialist
                        aggressor in the Third World. Most of the Muslim nations have formally
                        condemned Soviet oppression in Afghanistan. The Kremlin’s ability to
                        persuade the nonaligned movement to accept the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as an ally and to manipulate the movement against Soviet
                        adversaries has been undermined. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>Iran has become increasingly involved in the Afghanistan crisis in the last
                        few months. Tehran has provided important diplomatic support to the
                        insurgents fighting the Soviets. The central government has apparently not
                        lived up to its promises to provide material aid, but Tehran continues to
                        assert its willingness to do so if the Soviets do not withdraw from
                        Afghanistan. The Afghan insurgents have received material aid, however, from
                        the Iranian clergy, elements of the Revolutionary Guard, and local
                        officials—aid that reflects the general consensus in Iran in support of the
                        rebel cause. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Afghans have established a significant presence in Iran. The insurgents
                        train fighters in camps along the border that house more than 100,000
                        refugees and have offices in Tehran, Qom, and Mashhad. We have reports of
                        training in all three cities, and some Revolutionary Guard units apparently
                        are providing support for cross-border operations. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><pb n="786" facs="0831" xml:id="pg_786"/>Iranian involvement with the
                        insurgents seems certain to increase. Domestic pressures will incline the
                        government toward more active support of the rebels. For their part, the
                        insurgents will probably continue to find Iran an attractive base of
                        operations, especially given the small number of Soviet forces located in
                        the border area. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Since early June the Soviets have become increasingly alarmed by Iran’s role
                        in Afghanistan. They have taken a tougher line toward Iranians who have
                        taken outspoken public positions favoring the insurgents. Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> has, for example, been
                        characterized as an agent of the United States and China, and local
                        authorities in Mashhad have been accused of cooperating with the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. But Moscow has avoided direct criticism
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Khomeini</persName> government. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The tougher Soviet posture is not likely to dissuade Tehran, and the Soviets
                        may be forced to step up their pressure. They could do so—but only at the
                        cost of a significant deterioration in ties with Tehran. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>

                    <p>There are a number of reasons why Beijing, despite its claims to the
                        contrary, might not now be willing to make a serious effort to aid the
                        insurgents:</p>
                    <p>—Beijing may be disinclined to make a major effort in the absence of a
                        greater effort on the part of the West. China confronts the Soviets directly
                        along its own border and indirectly in Southeast Asia and may not wish to
                        lead the effort in Afghanistan and risk yet another confrontation with
                        Moscow in Southwest Asia. Heavy involvement <pb n="787" facs="0832" xml:id="pg_787"/>with the resistance now could also retard China’s
                        effort to improve ties with India, a major goal.</p>
                    <p>—Beijing may also believe that, on the one hand, its own resources do not
                        allow a larger effort, and, on the other, the insurgents are not capable of
                        effectively utilizing anything more than small arms anyway. Some Chinese
                        officials have criticized the insurgents as disorganized and
                        unsophisticated.</p>
                    <p>—It is conceivable China never intended to do more than it is at present. In
                        Beijing’s view of “labor sharing” with the West in the global anti-Soviet
                        struggle, China’s main effort should be in Southeast Asia. Because of its
                        strained military resources, geographic limitations, and, perhaps, because
                        of Islamabad’s failure to cooperate, China may have decided that the task of
                        thwarting the Soviets in Afghanistan belonged to the West and countries of
                        Southwest Asia. Its own frequent expressions of support for the insurgents
                        and assertions that it is rendering aid are thus tactics meant to arouse
                        more tangible support from other sources.</p>
                    <p>—The Chinese have been discouraged by Pakistan’s reluctance to assist them in
                        aiding the insurgents. [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>]
                        The Pakistanis, however, have recently claimed that they are willing to
                        cooperate with China in aiding the insurgents.</p>
                    <p>—China lacks an easy direct supply route to the insurgents. The
                        Chinese-Afghan border is extremely rugged and the main trail through the
                        region (the Wakhan Corridor) passes close to Russian border posts.
                        Undetected use of this route would be difficult, if not impossible, and the
                        trail seems ill-suited for the transport of significant amounts of arms.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                    <p>On balance Beijing may have been willing initially to make a significant
                        effort to aid the rebels on the assumption that it would do so in
                        cooperation with Pakistan and the West. After signs that Pakistan and the
                        West did not respond as forcefully as hoped, China may have embarked on a
                        small scale program to support groups in the northeast, perhaps by sending
                        supplies through the Wakhan corridor or northern Pakistan. Now, with some
                        experience in aiding the insurgents, Beijing may have concluded that the
                        risks involved in a more ambitious program outweigh the potential
                        benefits.</p>

                    <p>A second proposal was also unanimously supported, albeit with qualifications.
                        It involves a finding (attached at Tab A for your signature) that would have
                        us share with the Saudis the cost of up to [<hi rend="italic">amount not

                        would provide necessary training. The Pakistanis want this covertly because
                        of their earlier problems with our assistance offer. According to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, they see this as an integral and
                        necessary part of their ongoing support for the Afghan insurgents. State and
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> expressed concern that the
                        Pakistanis are using this method as a means of increasing our political
                        commitment to them, and noted that there should be no major problem for the
                        Pakistanis simply to buy the equipment. Nonetheless, in view of the urgent
                        Pakistani desire (and the fact that they control distribution of our
                        material and can skim off whatever they want anyway) it was agreed to
                        recommend that you approve the finding. The finding was changed, however, to
                        exclude the provision of US-origin equipment. The Pakistanis do not want it
                        for political reasons and there is a real danger that it might find its way
                        across the border. SA–7s are preferred, but these are in short supply;
                        European equivalents may be available. (S)</p>

                    <p>3. Begin text. Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>In the interest of continuing our exchange on Afghanistan and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations, I would like to comment
                        on your letter of June 27.</p>
                    <p><pb n="792" facs="0837" xml:id="pg_792"/>We have carefully considered the
                        implications of your announcement of the withdrawal of some Soviet military
                        units from Afghanistan. Your letter indicates that there has been a
                        reduction of the overall number of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, although
                        neither your public announcement nor our own analysis indicate that this is
                        necessarily the case. We will carefully watch for evidence of such a
                        reduction.</p>
                    <p>As the Venice Summit communiqué makes clear, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the other Summit participants would regard such
                        withdrawals as a useful contribution to the solution of the Afghan crisis if
                        they are permanent and continue until there is a complete withdrawal of the
                        Soviet troops.<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">See <ref target="#d281fn2">footnote 2, Document 281</ref>.</note> We would welcome as a
                        significant step an indication of your intention to undertake a process
                        leading to complete withdrawal and a political settlement.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the Soviet Union has legitimate interest in the security of
                        its borders and in friendly relations with Afghanistan. In our view, an
                        independent and non-aligned Afghan Government prepared to maintain friendly
                        relations with all its neighbors would be consistent with Soviet interests.
                        Such a government would have to be acceptable to the Afghan people, for
                        otherwise there can be no restoration of peace and tranquility in
                        Afghanistan. Any legitimate concern you may have regarding outside
                        interference in Afghanistan could be met by mutual and reciprocal guarantees
                        of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of
                        Afghanistan by all concerned parties.</p>
                    <p>Begin brackets. We have taken note of the Soviet position on a political
                        settlement as set forth in your letter. In our view, that formulation leaves
                        a number of important questions unanswered. For example, it offers no
                        indication of what the Soviet Union would regard as satisfactory assurances
                        of nonintervention, and it does not indicate whether and when all Soviet
                        forces would withdraw if such assurances were provided. In addition, it does
                        not address the problem created by the resistance of the Afghan people to
                        the policies of the present regime. End brackets.<note n="4" xml:id="d299fn4">This paragraph was not included in the final
                            text.</note></p>
                    <p>I would like to reiterate our strong interest in an improvement in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations based on reciprocity and
                        mutual restraint. The key to an improvement in this relationship remains a
                        political solution to the Afghan crisis which I believe can be achieved with
                        the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops, pursuant to appropriate
                        transitional arrangements. If you are prepared to discuss such a solution
                        seriously, <pb n="793" facs="0838" xml:id="pg_793"/>you will find us fully
                        and immediately cooperative. Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Edmund

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Judgments</p>
                    <p>After six months of fighting, the Soviets have not achieved any lasting
                        military success against the Afghan insurgency. A review of operations to
                        date shows that the 80,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan are no more able to
                        control the countryside than the Afghan Army was in 1979. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p><pb n="794" facs="0839" xml:id="pg_794"/>The first major Soviet
                        counterinsurgency campaign, which ran through mid-March and employed
                        conventional march tactics and area sweeps, failed to trap or destroy any
                        large insurgent bands. The insurgents, who easily eluded these operations,
                        sabotaged roads and struck government outposts to the rear and on the flanks
                        of the road-bound Soviets. Furthermore, they reinfiltrated after the Soviets
                        withdrew from operational areas. This forced the Soviets to garrison many
                        disaffected areas. As a result, their forces became thinly spread, making
                        them more vulnerable to ambushes, reducing their ability to mount operations
                        without regrouping, and creating logistics problems. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>By early April 1980, senior Soviet military officers in Afghanistan had
                        become pessimistic about their situation and short-term military prospects.
                            [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>] tactical and
                        organizational adjustments were begun. For example, the Soviets organized
                        hybrid brigades that combine airborne, infantry, and helicopter units. They
                        also created regiment-sized task forces composed of motorized rifle units
                        heavily reinforced with area-saturation artillery, such as multiple rocket
                        launchers. In addition, they formed small airborne detachments able to
                        respond quickly to targets of opportunity. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Although it is too early to judge the effect of these changes, results have
                        been limited so far. The new brigades have been used in several recent
                        operations, one of which resulted in large Soviet losses, suggesting that
                        the Soviets have not yet mastered airmobile tactics. Nor have the Soviets
                        trapped any large insurgent groups in decisive battles despite several sweep
                        operations. The infantry-artillery task forces have not suffered any
                        setbacks, but the Soviets have not yet demonstrated that such organizations
                        will be mobile and flexible enough for counterinsurgency operations in
                        difficult terrain. Soviet patrols may be achieving some modest success in
                        slowing border infiltration from Pakistan, and their sweeps may have some
                        effect on the ability of insurgent forces to concentrate for operations
                        against Soviet and Afghan units. The Soviets probably will continue to
                        emphasize and improve their airmobile and infantry-artillery task force
                        tactics this summer. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword,
                            and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>There are several persistent impediments to responsive counterinsurgency
                        operations which the Soviets so far apparently have not resolved. [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>] In addition, the slow pace
                        of Soviet tactical adjustments in Afghanistan suggests that approval for
                        operations must be obtained from Moscow. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking, codeword, and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviet forces now in Afghanistan appear to have little prospect of
                        substantially reducing the insurgency unless the Afghan Army can <pb n="795" facs="0840" xml:id="pg_795"/>be turned into an effective force that can
                        clear and maintain security in major areas of the countryside. The Soviets
                        attribute their inability to rebuild the Afghan Army to the failure of the
                        Babrak regime to develop political support. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>In planning the size and structure of their initial intervention force in
                        Afghanistan, the Soviets probably assumed that the Afghan Army would be both
                        willing and able to bear the brunt of counterinsurgency operations. For
                        their part, the Soviet forces were to secure a few key cities and supply
                        routes and to provide forces for limited counterinsurgency operations in the
                        countryside in support of the Afghan Army. Soviet leaders also probably
                        expected the introduction of Soviet combat troops to stiffen the resolve of
                        the Afghan Army and intimidate the insurgents. Instead the opposite has
                        occurred. The insurgency has grown while the Afghan Army has deteriorated at
                        an increasing rate. As a consequence, Soviet forces in Afghanistan have had
                        to shoulder responsibilities that had not been anticipated. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>It is unlikely that the performance of either the Afghan Government or the
                        Afghan Army can quickly be improved. Discord between the political factions
                        making up the Afghan regime is preventing effective administration, and the
                        prospects of resolving the contention are poor. Efforts to recruit new men
                        for the Afghan Army are having poor results and currently cannot even make
                        up the continuing losses through desertion. It probably will be impossible
                        to find the men to create the several additional Afghan divisions that the
                        Soviets want until there is considerably more administrative control over
                        the population. Moreover, Afghanistan’s borders cannot be sealed by the
                        Soviet and Afghan forces now available. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Despite the difficulties they have encountered, the Soviet field command in
                        Afghanistan now appears to be optimistic about the results of their recent
                        operations. At least some commanders apparently believe that the insurgents
                        have suffered serious setbacks and are now on the defensive. Large insurgent
                        bands are reportedly dispersing into groups of 50 men or less and seeking
                        refuge among the population. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                        declassified</hi>] The Soviet command in Afghanistan apparently believes
                        that it may be possible to establish the Afghan Government’s authority in
                        some contested areas and that the Afghan Army may be able to defeat the
                        smaller insurgent bands. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking,
                            codeword, and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>This optimism clashes with earlier Soviet views and contradicts recent
                        information available to us as well as views expressed by independent Soviet
                        observers. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] There is no
                        evidence that the Afghan Government is able to take hold in the
                            countryside—<pb n="796" facs="0841" xml:id="pg_796"/>even after Soviet
                        sweeps. Moreover, the Afghan Army continues to deteriorate and to perform
                        poorly. The Soviets reportedly have lost confidence in it and do not trust
                        it to perform security duties. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking,
                            codeword, and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>We do not know what pressures, if any, might be responsible for the apparent
                        optimism of at least some Soviet commanders in Afghanistan. Nor do we know
                        how Moscow might view it, especially in light of less sanguine reports and
                        other conflicting evidence. Nevertheless, any Soviet perception that
                        military prospects may be improving could affect the choice of options the
                        Soviets see ahead in Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking, codeword, and handling restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Through the fall of 1980, the Soviet forces now committed to operations in
                        Afghanistan are unlikely to reduce the rebellion permanently. They probably
                        will become more adept in the operational environment of Afghanistan, but
                        the insurgents are improving their arms, apparently increasing their
                        numbers, and adopting small-unit guerrilla tactics that will make them more
                        elusive and difficult to counter. Furthermore, the insurgents’ zeal for the
                        fight so far apparently remains high despite the casualties and hardships
                        they have endured. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>Turning to Afghanistan, the President said that some limited assistance was
                        being given to the Afghan freedom fighters who are struggling for their
                        independence against the Soviet invaders. The President noted that much of
                        the Afghan army has defected to the freedom fighters, taking their weapons
                        with them. The President said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        considers it important to give assistance to those who struggle for their
                        freedom. The President noted that Pakistan, even though under Soviet
                        pressure, was participating to some degree in efforts to support the Afghan
                        freedom fighters. The President said that these actions are very sensitive,
                        and that it is difficult to discuss them in complete candor. He also noted
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is willing to exchange
                        intelligence with the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> on the situation
                        in Afghanistan, and that we have benefitted from some information received
                        from the Chinese side.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has not been indifferent or passive in
                        responding to the difficult situation in which the Afghan freedom <pb n="798" facs="0843" xml:id="pg_798"/>fighters have found themselves. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that the
                        freedom fighters have one need which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has not been able to satisfy. This is a need for SA–7
                        ground-to-air missiles, which would be highly effective in reducing the
                        efficacy of the Soviet helicopter gun-ships. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that he had heard that the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> either has or is producing the SA–7
                        missile, and that if such weapons could be given to the freedom fighters, an
                        important contribution would have been made to their resistance.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that we can
                        deliver such weapons “indirectly but effectively” to the freedom fighters.
                        The President noted that we had been careful not to send any weapons of
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> origin into Afghanistan, as the
                        Soviets would use such weapons for propaganda purposes.</p>
                    <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> said that the Soviet
                        invasion of Afghanistan and the attack on Kampuchea had not happened by
                        chance. <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> described the attack on
                        Afghanistan as a premeditated plan by the Soviets, designed to give them
                        control of the country. <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> then
                        sketched the events in Afghanistan that led up to the Soviet attack. He
                        noted that three Afghan presidents had been murdered in a short time. He
                        said that this was a series of events almost without parallel, and that the
                        murders had been the direct result of Soviet intervention. <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> said that the attack into Afghanistan
                        was part of a thrust to the South by the Soviets, and that if they succeed
                        in controlling Afghanistan, they will then move on toward the Indian Ocean
                        and the oil-producing regions of the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> noted that the American <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has predicted that Soviet oil production
                        will decline, starting about 1985, and that the Soviets feel the need to
                        seize oil producing regions. <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName>
                        commented that even if the Soviet oil production were not to decline, they
                        would still undertake the same sort of strategic effort.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>Returning to the subject of Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> said that he had met General <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> recently, and that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said he hoped for more aid from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> paid tribute to the two Islamic
                        conferences, which he said had been helpful. He cited the three-man
                        committee set up by the Islamic Conference as performing good work.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> said that the Soviets have
                        been putting pressure on Pakistan, even threatening it with “another
                        dismemberment.” <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> praised
                        Pakistan’s courage in standing up to the Soviet pressure. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> said that he agreed the
                        Pakistanis have been courageous.</p>
                    <p>Referring to Iran, <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> said that the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> has stated its opposition to the
                        holding of the hostages. He said that he believes the Soviet attack into
                        Afghanistan also threatens Iran. He noted that the Iranians have called upon
                        the Soviets to withdraw from Afghanistan, and that the Iranians have said
                        they will support the Afghan rebels if the Soviets do not pull out.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HGK_1">Hua</persName> noted that the Iranians are
                        keeping their word <pb n="799" facs="0844" xml:id="pg_799"/>on this matter.
                        Iran has refused to recognize the Soviet puppet regime in Kabul, and at the
                        recent Islamic conference, the Iranians accepted six Afghan rebel groups as
                        part of their own delegation. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> noted that the Iranians have also told the Soviets to
                        reduce their presence in Iran, and that some of the 2,000 Soviet “advisors”
                        will have to move out.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Ambassador opened by saying that he wished to ask me two questions prior
                        to his return to Moscow, because he will be asked them by the Politburo: (1)
                        who will win the elections; (2) what outcome would be better for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations?</p>
                    <p>I responded by saying that my objective judgment is that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s lead will evaporate as the public
                        nears the moment of decision regarding who ought to be the President of this
                        country, especially since <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        will not be able to withstand close press scrutiny, and that the reelection
                        of the President is obviously better for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations because the President can pursue both a
                        policy of firmness in dealing with Soviet expansionism and arms control as
                        well as detente. Accordingly, his reelection can avoid the decade of the
                        80’s being a repetition of the unmitigated Cold War of 1945–1955.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> responded by saying that he
                        fully agrees but wanted to know what, in that case, prevented an improvement
                        in our relations. I told him that there is no point in playing games with
                        each other, that Afghanistan was clearly the issue because it not only posed
                        a strategic <pb n="800" facs="0845" xml:id="pg_800"/>challenge to our
                        interests but also because it has become a symbol of what is perceived in
                        this country as Soviet expansionism.</p>
                    <p>This led to a discussion of whether the Afghanistani problem can somehow be
                        solved. I explained to him what we mean by the “transitional arrangements”
                        designed to create a government in Afghanistan which is not hostile to the
                        Soviet Union but which is not dependent for its survival on the presence of
                        a Soviet occupation army.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> maintained that we are in
                        effect insisting that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>
                        has to go, whereas the Soviet Union is willing to solve the problem on the
                        basis of withdrawal of Soviet forces, once an Afghan army that is capable of
                        sustaining <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> has been created.
                        “Why not accept then a solution based on the principle of neutrality and
                        non-intereference?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> is
                        part of the problem that needs to be solved and hence cannot be the
                        solution. To govern he has to have a Soviet army of occupation. Moreover, to
                        govern without Soviet troops, there would have to be a massive and
                        inevitably brutal counterinsurgency operation which would further poison
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations. This is why it is
                        in our mutual interest to try to find an accommodation soon, perhaps through
                        more extensive explorations of what a transitional arrangement would
                        involve. If such a solution could be found, it would be a real breakthrough,
                        making possible rapid progress on other issues, notably arms control.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me about the
                        prospects for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. I told him that the
                        President and the Secretary of State are fully committed to it and that we
                        will seek its ratification. However, (1) if the present situation in
                        Afghanistan continues, ratification will be difficult; (2) if there is a
                        massive Soviet counter-insurgency after the Olympics, ratification will
                        become even more difficult because public emotions here will be further
                        aroused; (3) but if there is some genuine progress on Afghanistan, pointing
                        toward the withdrawal of all Soviet troops and involving perhaps some
                        transitional arrangements, then the public would welcome <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and ratification would be
                        facilitated.</p>
                    <p>I added that the public wishes a firm policy toward the Soviet Union but also
                        desires accommodation with the Soviet Union. It is our task to make that
                        accommodation possible and I hoped that <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> would impress the Soviet leaders with this
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>He tried to discuss <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> and the Middle East
                        with me but I told him that <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss> had been
                        discussed with <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>, that on
                        the Middle East I did not have anything new to say, and that in any case, I
                        knew that he would be having a more formal and comprehensive discussion <pb n="801" facs="0846" xml:id="pg_801"/>on Monday with the Secretary of
                        State. (I did not mention the fact that there will be a letter to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>.)<note n="2" xml:id="d302fn2">The

                        Expressed his appreciation for the opportunity of considering our current
                        policy towards Pakistan to determine if it is relevant to the problems that
                        we may be facing. He asked Adm. <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName> to begin with an estimate of Soviet intentions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi>
                        Summarized the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> paper which is Tab A of
                        the package for the meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">The briefing
                            package for the meeting was not attached and not found.</note> He
                        reiterated that the Soviets are likely to concentrate their efforts on the
                        Afghan side of the border. We have noted the use of a large number of land
                        mines already and a strong pressure on food supply. He believes that they
                        will also continue to probe against Pakistan on a small scale but the degree
                        of Pakistan resistance is likely to be the measure of how aggressive they
                        get. (That is, if the Pakistanis resist effectively, the Soviets will hold
                        back.) He does not expect a change in that policy barring a drastic further
                        deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan or a belief that the western
                        countries are backing the insurgents more openly.</p>

                        what extent are the Olympics a factor? After they are over will the Soviets

                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi> They
                        certainly will within Afghanistan, although we have not yet seen any
                        build-up yet. I do not think that the end of the Olympics will have much
                        impact on their intentions towards Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName>:</hi> Said
                        that he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>’s
                        estimate. The Soviets would be very ruthless internally and would try hard
                        to seal the border. There might then perhaps be some increase in incursions
                        after the Olympics.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi>
                        Estimated that the Soviets would need from 200,000 to 250,000 men to
                        suppress the insurgency in the major border areas. It would take them from
                        six to twelve months to achieve that kind of a build-up. He also noted that
                        October–November is the beginning of the bad weather.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName></hi> noted
                        that a build-up of Soviet forces within Afghanistan would be likely to
                        trigger an enlarged flow of equipment to the insur<pb n="803" facs="0848" xml:id="pg_803"/>gents, hence increasing the importance of control of
                        the border. Would that sequence of events be likely to trigger a stronger
                        Soviet reaction?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi>
                        Possibly. The issue seems to be more what the Soviets think is the flow of
                        weapons to the insurgents from outside. They probably overestimate that
                        considerably today. The bulk of the equipment being used is acquired within
                        the country. In an escalating situation ammunition would be an increasing
                        problem.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>:</hi> A
                        substantial Soviet build-up would seem to be counter to the diplomatic
                        initiatives they are taking with regard to claims of withdrawal, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_TNF_1">TNF</gloss>,
                        etc. How would this affect their thinking?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi> We
                        think they will probably take a middle course. The drain on their resources
                        is not unbearable. They are very intent on playing the European card and are
                        unlikely to risk this by a dramatic upswing in their activity. We think that
                        they are following a long haul strategy.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>:</hi> If the
                        Soviet small scale probes meet only soft Pakistani resistance, might this

                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi>
                        Perhaps, but these are raids, not an invasion. We have noted that the
                        nationalists are using Pakistan increasingly as a base of operation rather
                        than simply as a refuge. We expect that small Soviet incursions are a likely
                        response.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>:</hi> Is
                        there a possibility of an interplay arising out of this that would generate
                        momentum towards an invasion? Should we not take this into account in our
                        current activities?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi>
                        Certainly, but I still think that the Soviets will show a lot of
                        patience.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_JDC_1">Jones</persName>:</hi> We
                        agree that they will be ruthless internally and perpetrate some incursions.
                        If that doesn’t work then they are likely to escalate their attacks.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TSM_1">Turner</persName>:</hi> Also
                        notice that there is an air option available. It is a less clear-cut kind of
                        aggression and the Pakistanis have less capability to meet it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>:</hi> There
                        probably will be a need for increased help to the insurgency. Does this mean
                        that we should help the Pakistanis more? Are they likely to ask for
                        substantial increase of that assistance?</p>

                        the critical event as a threat to the independence and integrity of
                        Pakistan. We need to define perhaps more exactly what that would involve. If

                        recourse to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> or to the other Islamic

                        requirement for us to give a signal to the Soviets? What should we be
                        considering in the way of a US response including military supply? There are
                        a number of aspects—the attitude of Congress, the governing law, allies, our
                        relations with the Soviets, etc. Should we be considering specific steps now
                        or should we wait until we have had consultations with the Pakistanis?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>:</hi> In
                        addition to speculating on what the Soviets and Pakistanis might think we
                        should ask what we want to do in order to influence the Soviets and what we
                        want the Pakistanis to do. I see two things: First, we want to deter Soviet
                        political intimidation of Pakistan. Second, we want Pakistan to continue its
                        role of maximum support to the Afghan resistance. If this is correct then we
                        should take actions that first, send a message to the Soviets that would
                        threaten escalation should they put too much pressure on Pakistan (this
                        might not necessarily imply a military response), and second, give the
                        Pakistanis a political and psychological sense of assurance that we will
                        respond if they turn to us. This will fortify them. Both of these objectives
                        can be served by the same policy, specifically a greater predisposition to
                        help on military supply. I do not think there is any basis for approaching
                        the Soviets now with warnings about actions against Pakistan.</p>

                        out the various ways in which we might have to respond. If we did this it
                        would become public knowledge through leaks, and this would be a useful
                        signal in itself.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>:</hi> That

                        are restraints on the Soviets. Discussions would however be good to forewarn
                        Congress and educate it about a possible future danger. We would keep the
                        consultations limited (they would leak anyway). This will of course prompt
                        the Congressmen to ask the very kinds of difficult questions that we are
                        asking around this table here today. We will have to have our responses
                        worked out in advance. They, too, will leak. It is hard to decide now but at
                        some point we are going to have to determine what our future responses would
                        be. Would a major invasion of Pakistan call for a US military response? The
                        1959 Agreement does not of course force us to make an automatic
                        response.</p>

                        it will lead to more tension. Thus, our own actions are moving us along
                        towards the ultimate question. I wonder if Pakistani steadfastness would
                        warrant such action on our part? We have not faced this question in any

                        the great distance that Pakistan is from us. We should do our full
                        contingency planning before we go to Congress. The non-proliferation
                        question also is going to be a difficult one as we know from our current

                        basis because of the past bad experience they had with the $400 million

                    </list>
                    <p>I was rather bemused by <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>’s
                        performance at the first session of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                        last Thursday, including his coy disclaimer at the end.<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">See <ref target="#d303">Document 303</ref>. Reference
                            is apparently to something <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> said off the record.</note> One observer
                        suggested that he was demonstrating his doubts about “your” policy of
                        bolstering the rebels. He continually returned to the question of whether we
                        were not, in effect, helping create precisely the situation we are worried
                        about (i.e. a Soviet attack on Pakistan). (S)</p>
                    <p>There is of course considerable truth in this but it is not much use for
                        policy planning. First of all, there doesn’t seem to be much of any
                        alternative that promises success for our policies. Also, we are not the
                        only ones stoking the fire; the Arabs, Chinese and, of course, many Paks
                        themselves are enthusiastically involved. Finally, the Afghans are going to
                        carry on, and as long as they do the Soviets psychologically <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to believe that foreign assistance is the reason
                        for the insurgency no matter what the truth. (S)</p>
                    <p>In the area of difficult questions, let me commend one more to your
                        conscience. At what point does our rhetoric and covert assistance to the
                        Afghans simply encourage them to get themselves killed uselessly? I don’t
                        think we have reached the point yet and may not for quite a while. Perhaps
                        never. It is something we have to keep in mind and review periodically,
                        however, since a policy of using Afghans “to make the Soviets pay” is
                        morally defensible only as long as it does not lead to <hi rend="italic">avoidable and unnecessary</hi> bloodshed. (S)</p>
                    <p>The second broad question that <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>
                        raised is how far do we want to go in committing ourselves to Pakistan?
                        Would we commit military forces? Are we whistling in the dark? Do we risk
                        misleading the Pakistanis to their great detriment? These questions make me
                        extremely uneasy. I am not convinced that the American people and Congress
                        have had their consciousness raised to the point where we would really <pb n="812" facs="0857" xml:id="pg_812"/>stand behind Pakistan. There will
                        be too many “good reasons” to renege on whatever commitments we make.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>This is related to an issue that <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> did not directly raise: How much effort do we want to
                        put into our relationship with Pakistan? This is something that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> should address, especially as regards
                        economic assistance. You probably have a greater sense of urgency in this
                        matter than anybody else around the table and will have to articulate it if
                        the message is to be gotten through. (The issue is not so much substantive
                        as overcoming bureaucratic inertia.)<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3"><persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> placed a star in the left
                            margin beside this paragraph.</note> (C)</p>
                    <p>The following are some more specific questions that arose from the Thursday
                        meeting and will probably recur. (The list draws, in part, on the internal
                        State briefing memo for this meeting.) (U)</p>
                    <p>1. What steps can we take to signal our concern to the Soviets and encourage
                        Pakistani support of the insurgents? (Arms sales is the only item on the
                        horizon.) (S)</p>
                    <p>2. Should the US be more openly involved with the insurgents? (<persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> asked this several times; the
                        answer is that our role is limited by Pakistani sensitivities.) (S)</p>
                    <p>3. How can we ensure that we do not get out front too far and that we keep
                        the Muslims in the lead? (Or, put another way, how do we keep this in the
                        East-South, rather than East-West context?) (C)</p>
                    <p>4. When (and how) will we know that the Soviets have overstepped acceptable
                        bounds in their dealings with Pakistan? (S)</p>
                    <p>5. How can we best consult on these matters with the Paks? <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha Shahi</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> this week? <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>-Zia while <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> is out of the country? Intelligence channels?
                        (Probably all three in varying degrees but I like the <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>-Zia channel best <hi rend="italic">if</hi>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> is willing to commit himself
                        without <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName>. This also raises the
                        question of what <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> is supposed
                        to tell <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. You should urge State to
                        produce some instructions to <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName>
                        for our clearance.) (C)</p>
                    <p>6. Related to this, what should <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> tell <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Agha
                            Shahi</persName> when they meet?<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4"><persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> placed a star in the left
                            margin beside this sentence.</note> State will probably brief him to
                        stick to Afghanistan and third country issues; should he raise the bilateral
                        relationship? If so, in what terms? (C)</p>
                    <p>7. If <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> consults with <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName>, what should he say? State will point
                        out to <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> that the conversations
                        could soon get off into War Powers considerations and the like. I am
                        concerned that this is likely to scare off any but the most intrepid
                        supporter of Pakistan. If it is the case, however, we had better face it
                        now. Incidentally, in the Thursday <pb n="813" facs="0858" xml:id="pg_813"/>meeting you indicated that it didn’t matter whether the Paks would like
                        the idea of our consulting with Congress with the attendant leaks. It could
                        matter very much if the Paks found it necessary to repudiate the position
                        that we had taken with the Congress. We don’t need another affair like that.
                        (C)</p>

                        issue of price quotations on F–15s.<note n="6" xml:id="d304fn6"><persName corresp="#p_TTP_1">Thornton</persName> placed a star in the left
                            margin beside this sentence.</note> (You will have to raise it; State
                        won’t.) The Paks have asked us how much 40 or so F–15s would cost. State is
                        unwilling to tell them (or if so, to tell them in a negative way) on the
                        grounds that by quoting prices we are conveying a willingness to sell. That
                        is nonsense, if we make ourselves clear to the Paks. They need data for
                        planning purposes and if we want to be seen as a credible friend to them,
                        this is the minimum we can do. The country director, just returned from a
                        trip to Pakistan, underscores this as the most important single item pending
                        with Pakistan. (S)</p>
                    <p>11. Further to the question of whether to tell <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> where the Persian Gulf is: According to a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> report, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> told the Chinese that “The US appeared to be interested
                        in the security of the Persian Gulf but not of Pakistan.” This reflects his
                        apparent assumption that Pakistan is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> included in
                        the US security perimeter. (S)</p>

                            most notable feature of the <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> letter is its insistence on Soviet unwillingness

                            to avoid any hint of readiness to talk about replacing Babrak because
                            they fear this would only fuel factional infighting in Kabul.” <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1">Vest</persName> made three recommendations in the

                            reply to the Embassy in Moscow (this telegram); 2) send a telegram to
                            the Embassies in London, Paris, and Bonn relaying the substance of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s letter (the draft

                    <p>2. Vasev called July 22 to deliver <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s reply to my July 14 letter on Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">See <ref target="#d299">Document
                            299</ref>.</note> (Text para 3 below.)</p>
                    <p>3. I would like in continuation of our exchange of views to express some
                        considerations in connection with your letter of July 14.</p>
                    <p>We have noted the interest of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Government expressed in your letter in improving Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations. As is well known to you, this
                        is consistently favored by the Soviet leadership. However, it is important
                        to act precisely along these lines in practice. We, on our part, are ready
                        to do so provided there is a similar readiness on the part of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Given such an approach and being guided by broad goals of strengthening peace
                        and security, our two countries, as was proved on more than one occasion in
                        the past, are quite capable of developing constructively their relations and
                        finding mutually acceptable solutions to most complicated questions of
                        mutual interest for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                    <p><pb n="816" facs="0861" xml:id="pg_816"/>This, to use your own words, is the
                        key to everything. Attempts to reduce the whole matter to any one single
                        question, to tie to such a question the prospects of our relations as the
                        whole, are not only wrong but also non-productive. You are aware of our
                        assessment of the causes that led to the present state of Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations. This was also the subject of
                        detailed discussions at our meeting in Vienna.<note n="4" xml:id="d306fn4">See <ref target="#d272">Document 272</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Therefore, I will not restate this assessment.</p>
                    <p>Now with regard to Afghanistan. We note the recognition in your letter of the
                        legitimate interest of the Soviet Union in ensuring the security of its
                        borders and in friendly relations with Afghanistan as well as of our concern
                        about an outside interference in Afghanistan. This would seem to be a
                        realistic premise.</p>
                    <p>However, this premise is directly contradicted by your persistent notion
                        about the government, which exists in the Democratic Republic of
                        Afghanistan, being unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        and by raising in this connection the question of “transition” to some other
                        government. Here a complete clarity is in order: We do not intend to and
                        will not engage even in discussions on posing the question in such a
                        way.</p>
                    <p>I may as well note here that no useful purpose either can be served by the
                        attempts to put in doubt the fact of the recent withdrawal of some Soviet
                        units from Afghanistan. Why are you doing this? After all, you know—as, by
                        the way, the whole world knows,—that such doubts are groundless.</p>
                    <p>As to your question what assurances of non-interference in the internal
                        affairs of Afghanistan would be considered by us as satisfactory, the answer
                        thereto is contained in the known proposals of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Government of last May 14.<note n="5" xml:id="d306fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> An adequately full
                        discussion was devoted to it also in our previous exchanges of views. The
                        guarantees of non-interference must be an integral part of the general
                        political settlement, the path to which goes through direct negotiations of
                        Pakistan and Iran with the Government of Afghanistan with the aim of
                        normalizing relations between them with simultaneous cessation of armed
                        incursions into the territory of Afghanistan as well as of all forms of
                        interference in the internal affairs of that country in general.</p>
                    <p>It is Pakistan and Iran who, by continuing to refuse to conduct negotiations,
                        are bringing the task of the political settlement to an impasse. This is
                        why, if the United States is genuinely interested in such a settlement, it
                        could, as we have already pointed out, exert appropriate influence on the
                        Pakistan leaders and induce them to hold negotiations with the Government of
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><pb n="817" facs="0862" xml:id="pg_817"/>We would like to hope that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side will be able to make a
                        realistic assessment of the situation and will take steps to facilitate in
                        practice the process of political settlement of the situation around
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>You may have no doubt that such a position will be met with appropriate
                        understanding on our part.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                    <p>—Your letter of July 22 raises questions concerning the Soviet position on
                        withdrawal from Afghanistan.<note n="3" xml:id="d307fn3">See <ref target="#d306">Document 306</ref>.</note> Since this is a central
                        issue in our discussions of a possible political settlement in Afghanistan,
                        I would appreciate any clarifications you can offer.</p>
                    <p>—We obviously differ on the significance of the military withdrawal you have
                        announced. Our analysis indicates that this was part of a tactical
                        redeployment designed to make Soviet units more effective. I would be
                        interested in knowing whether there has been a reduction in the overall
                        number of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, whether these withdrawals are
                        permanent and whether you are prepared to undertake a process which would
                        lead to complete withdrawal and a political settlement.</p>
                    <p>—In your letter of July 22, there is no reference to ultimate Soviet
                        withdrawal from Afghanistan. Is this a change in the Soviet position? If
                        satisfactory assurances were provided would there be a simultaneous
                        withdrawal of all Soviet troops?</p>
                    <p>—As we have said, we would be prepared to explore some transitional
                        arrangement to facilitate such a solution. A government acceptable to the
                        Afghan people would be essential.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, your letter of July 22 stresses that normalization of relations
                        between Afghanistan and its neighbors should take place simultaneously with
                        the cessation of “armed incursions into the territory of Afghanistan as well
                        as of all forms of interference in the internal affairs of that country in
                        general.” This implies that the Soviet Union would withdraw all its forces
                        from Afghanistan to coincide with normalization of relations between
                        Afghanistan and neighboring states. Is this your position?</p>
                    <p>—The questions I have posed in this and my last letter represent serious
                        efforts to gain a clearer understanding of your position. I hope you will
                        give them careful consideration.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Ed,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>At our lunch Tuesday we talked about the problem of maintaining the security
                        of information in foreign affairs.<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">The previous
                            Tuesday was July 29. No record of that meeting was found.</note> I told
                        you I had become deeply depressed by our seeming inability to maintain any
                        confidences and our further inability to see what this tells us about the
                        condition of our principal institutions. I promised to send you the
                        specifics of the Afghanistan example which I cited.</p>
                    <p>In the course of 1979 the President began to move toward supporting the
                        low-level insurgency that appeared to have developed against the pro-Soviet
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> government in Kabul. In July
                        and again in November, Presidential Findings directed that small amounts of
                        nonmilitary aid be passed to these groups.</p>
                    <p>On December 19, 1979, <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> charged that “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is stepping up interference in
                        Afghanistan’s internal affairs, supporting the insurgents who are waging an
                        armed struggle against this country’s legitimate government.” <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> cited “the latest issue of the magazine
                        COUNTERSPY.” (I am informed by staff of the Intelligence Committee that this
                        journal is or was associated with the Institute for Policy Studies.)</p>
                    <p>On December 24 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>. <hi rend="italic">As it happens</hi>
                        a Presidential Finding was then making its way through the bureaucracy
                        calling for a stepping up of the earlier program directed against <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>, providing some $2 million in lethal
                        military equipment. This Presidential Finding was signed December 28. It had
                        begun as a project directed against the previous regime, but now of course
                        took place in the context of the full-scale Soviet intervention.</p>
                    <p>On January 1 <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> charged that, “The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is directly involved in training Afghan
                        rebels in camps in Pakistan and maintains contacts with
                        counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries in Afghanistan itself.” The
                        journal <hi rend="italic">Counterspy</hi> is mentioned.</p>
                    <p>On January 5 the <hi rend="italic">Boston Globe</hi> reports that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration has
                        undertaken an unannounced “hush-hush decision that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> . . . will do everything possible to slip
                        weapons to the Moslem <pb n="820" facs="0865" xml:id="pg_820"/>insurgents in
                        Afghanistan to ensure the Russian invasion there will be long, bloody and

                    <p>On January 9 the Presidential Finding of December 28 was presented to the
                        Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The date and subject of this
                        meeting was reported in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times Magazine</hi>

                        included the paragraph:</p>
                    <p>“White House officials said on Feb. 15 that the United States had begun an
                        operation to supply the insurgents with light infantry weapons. . . . The
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, the White House source said, had
                        been assigned to carry out the covert mission.”<note n="9" xml:id="d308fn9">See Drew Middleton, “Aides Disagree on Level of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Arms Aid to Afghans,” <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi>, July 21, 1980, p. A3.</note></p>
                    <p>And so why ought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> not be
                        berating you with these charges? I think it may be agreed that the Soviet
                        invasion of Afghanistan was a decisive moment in modern history: the first
                        such event since the Second World War. It had the potential to restore a
                        measure of clarity and balance to American views of the present world
                        situation. <pb n="821" facs="0866" xml:id="pg_821"/>In particular it made it
                        possible for almost anyone to see the elemental mendacity of Soviet
                        statements about their activities and intentions. They lie. But then what
                        happened? Almost immediately the United States Government (evidently the
                        White House itself) gave out information to the press which supported, even
                        confirmed, the Soviet lie.</p>
                    <p>Could there have been a greater disservice to our nation? What is to be said
                        of those who did it?</p>
                    <p>More importantly, what is to be said of the state of our institutions when
                        such things can happen? What does it mean when men charged with the
                        responsibility for this information find it more rewarding to break the
                        confidence than to keep it? This goes to profound questions of institutional
                        loyalty and morale. An organizational theorist, observing such symptoms,
                        would almost certainly judge that such institutions were in deep
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>This surely is my view. After almost four years on the Intelligence Committee
                        I have come to the conclusion, for example, that the Central Intelligence
                        Agency is practically defunct and is in many ways a liability. (I mentioned
                        to you that earlier this year I placed the National Intelligence Estimates
                        in the <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>,<note n="10" xml:id="d308fn10">See, for example, Senator <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Moynihan</persName> speaking on “The Role of the Central
                            Intelligence Agency,” 96th Cong., 2nd sess., <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record—Senate</hi>, 126, pt. 9:11371.</note> by which
                        I mean the reports of them that had by then appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.) Clearly
                        we need an intelligence system that can keep its secrets and, in a general

                        problem. (Thus: if it is impossible to keep secrets, perhaps the government
                        should not try to do anything that depends on secrets being kept.) This is a
                        subject about which political scientists, for example, might very well have
                        something useful to say. It is a subject that can be <hi rend="italic">studied</hi>. If you would like to pursue the matter, I am at your
                        disposal, as nothing troubles me more just now.<note n="11" xml:id="d308fn11"><persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> replied

                    <p>Our information on the status of the insurgency—[<hi rend="italic">2 lines
                            not declassified</hi>]—is extensive but uneven in quality and far from
                        complete. We have difficulty getting enough good information on such basic
                        questions as how the insurgents are organized, how many there are, how they
                        cooperate, and how many casualties there have been. The limits on such
                        information have made it difficult, for example, to arrive at confident
                        judgments about the insurgents’ ability to stand up over time to increasing
                        Soviet pressure. (See Annex A [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Insurgent Activity</p>
                    <p>Perhaps our best information comes indirectly through the Soviet and Afghan
                        reaction to insurgent activity. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] we can establish that the insurgency has spread to
                        every Afghan province since the Soviet invasion. Insurgents harass traffic
                        on the main roads, attacking military and civilian convoys and sometimes
                        setting up their own checkpoints. They attack isolated Soviet and Afghan
                        army units, occasionally slipping inside security patrols to hit garrisons.
                        Although they usually attempt to avoid clashes with large units, the
                        insurgents have inflicted heavy casualties on them in a few engagements.
                        They have organized strikes and demonstrations in cities, particularly
                        Herat, Qandahar, and Jalalabad, but also Kabul. They have killed numerous
                        Soviets and Afghan officials on the streets of Afghan cities. Sabotage and
                        arson—particularly the burning of schools—are common. In rural areas, their
                        threats and killings have disrupted civil administration and prevented the
                        implementation of government programs. In some areas, except for a few
                        isolated garrisons, the insurgents are in complete control, dispensing
                        justice and raising taxes.</p>
                    <p>The insurgent hold is strongest in some mountainous areas where terrain
                        inhibits Soviet military operations. These areas are generally <pb n="823" facs="0868" xml:id="pg_823"/>also the least important to the Soviets and
                        the Afghan Government, and no serious counter-insurgency operations have
                        been attempted in some of them. Even less remote areas where the insurgents
                        have eliminated government authority, government garrisons still hold the
                        main towns. On the other hand, there is resistance in areas where Soviet
                        troops are concentrated and the government has a fair degree of control.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents have not taken over a major Afghan city or even a provincial
                        capital for more than a few days, although they are a pervasive presence in
                        most urban areas. The Soviets have shown in Kabul that they will deal firmly
                        with any popular uprising, and the threat of Soviet reaction has almost
                        certainly been important in keeping the urban areas from getting totally out
                        of control.</p>
                    <p>There is some evidence that the Soviets believe the situation is improving in
                        Afghanistan—perhaps stabilizing—and they clearly show no sign of withdrawing
                        from Afghanistan. The evidence shows that they are there for a long haul and
                        are beginning to emphasize political consolidation as well as military
                        operations. Although only a very small part of the population supports the
                        government and insurgency continues at a high level, the Soviets may have
                        been successful, at least temporarily, in keeping the insurgence from
                        getting worse. (In Annex B, we discuss the level of insurgency province by
                        province.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Insurgent Organization</p>
                    <p>The insurgents in Afghanistan are organized into a large number of distinct
                        groups, probably several hundred. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] reports that there are 79 insurgent leaders among the
                        Pathan tribesmen alone, each presumably heading an independent band. There
                        are probably as many more in the remainder of the country. A few of these
                        insurgent groups—primarily in urban areas—are based on political ideologies
                        or programs. The overwhelming majority, however, represent tribes or
                        geographic areas, and ridding their areas of the foreign invader is their
                        principal motivation.</p>
                    <p>The first loyalty of most Afghans is to their villages or extended families.
                        The basic insurgent unit is headed by a village or family leader and rarely
                        consists of more than 50 men. Such units, however, seem to cooperate closely
                        when necessary with others from neighboring villages and frequently coalesce
                        in large insurgent groups numbering several hundred men. The membership in
                        the basic units fluctuates; men leave the battlefield because they have more
                        important business at home, but may return when fighting becomes more
                        intense. One insurgent leader in Konarha province, for example, reportedly
                        has 200 to 300 men under his command most of the time, but for a major
                        operation can count on 1,000.</p>
                    <p><pb n="824" facs="0869" xml:id="pg_824"/>Cooperation among the larger groups
                        is inhibited by the difficulties of communication and travel in a rugged
                        country, by suspicion of outsiders—even men from the next valley—and by the
                        reluctance of most Afghans to take orders from anyone, especially another
                        local leader with no greater claims to leadership.</p>
                    <p>There have nevertheless been some operations involving more than one
                        insurgent band, sometimes even bands from different ethnic groups. On
                        occasion, the failure of such operations has led to fighting between the
                        bands, each blaming the other for defeat. Since the Soviet invasion, there
                        has been growing cooperation both among insurgents in Afghanistan and
                        between Afghan insurgents and exile groups in Pakistan. Some of the
                        insurgents engaged in the fighting outside Kabul in June reportedly came
                        from provinces near the Pakistani border. The fighting probably would not
                        have extended over as large an area had a number of insurgent groups not
                        coordinated their activities. Predominant Pathan exile organizations and the
                        Hazaras of central Afghanistan are establishing contact with each other. New
                        weapons and tactics seem to pass quickly to tribes in the interior. In
                        general, however, each insurgent group continues to operate with little
                        reference to others fighting in the same cause.</p>
                    <p>The degree of cooperation also seems to vary by ethnic group. It may be least
                        among the fiercely independent Pathans along the Pakistani border. Among the
                        Nuristanis of Konarha province, however, there was considerable cooperation
                        even before the Soviet invasion. The Hazaras of central Afghanistan may even
                        have a rudimentary overall organization, comprising two umbrella groups over
                        several smaller insurgent organizations.</p>
                    <p>The best known—but perhaps the least important—of the insurgent groups are
                        the exile organizations. There are six main groups (five of them united in
                        the Islamic Alliance for the Liberation of Afghanistan) and a number of
                        smaller groups, most of them based in Pakistan. The exiles have served as a
                        channel for aid to those fighting in Afghanistan, their propaganda has
                        probably encouraged the resistance, and some of them have men actually
                        engaged in fighting. There is however, little basis for their claims that
                        they have large followings in Afghanistan, that they speak for the
                        insurgents, or that they have much control over insurgent activities. (See
                        Annex C for a fuller treatment of the exiles.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Insurgent Strength</p>
                    <p>There is no reliable information on which to base an estimate of insurgent
                        strength. Our guess is that it lies somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000.
                        Most of the country’s 15 million people resent the Soviet occupation, but
                        only a small percentage is actively engaged in the fighting.</p>
                    <p><pb n="825" facs="0870" xml:id="pg_825"/>We probably have more complete
                        reporting about insurgent strength in Konarha province than in any other
                        part of the country. Even so, the information available does not permit us
                        to estimate insurgent strength there more precisely than several
                        thousand.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] there are as many as several
                        hundred thousand insurgents in the country. [<hi rend="italic">5½ lines not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] put the number of
                        insurgents in “main groupings” at about 28,000. [<hi rend="italic">1 line
                            not declassified</hi>] had unconfirmed reports of a similar number in
                        the Kabul area alone. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] reported the destruction of the main insurgent groups
                        in Badakshan, Baghlan, Qonduz, Nangarhar, Ghazni, Qandahar, Helmand, Herat,
                        and Bamian provinces, and may no longer include still active insurgents
                        there in the strength estimated for the main groupings. Soviet pressure has
                        broken some of the larger groups into smaller bands, but these might
                        actually be more effective in guerrilla warfare.</p>
                    <p>Other methods of estimating insurgent strength are equally unsatisfactory. We
                        do not know the number of insurgent bands nor the average size of a band.
                        Some groups are well over 1,000, others less than 100, and almost nothing is
                        known about most. Assuming, however, that there are around 200 insurgent
                        groups, and that the average size of each is about 300—groups of this size
                        appear to be fairly typical—there would be on the order of 60,000
                        insurgents.</p>
                    <p>Estimates of insurgent strength also depend on the definition of an
                        insurgent. At any given time few of the insurgent bands are at their
                        greatest possible strength, and in large areas of the country potential
                        insurgents have no Soviets to fight. Although there might be about 50,000
                        men opposing the Soviets at any one time, this strength could double if the
                        Soviets were to conduct simultaneous military operations throughout the
                        country. The number of men who have participated at one time or another in
                        fighting against the Soviets or Afghan Communists during the past two years
                        may be several times greater.</p>
                    <p>Estimating insurgent casualties is also difficult. Afghan military claims are
                        clearly exaggerated, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        Arms and Supplies</p>
                    <p>Although outside help has become increasingly important, the insurgents rely
                        primarily on weapons they had when the Marxists took over in April 1978 or
                        have since captured from the Afghan military, obtained from deserters, or
                        purchased on the local black market. (The sale of ammunition and
                        occasionally arms is widespread in the Afghan Army, and some Soviet troops
                        reportedly have also been involved.) We have no statistics on the number of
                        weapons the insurgents have obtained from sources in the country, but there
                        have been tens of thousands of deserters and defectors from the Afghan Army,
                        many of them taking their weapons with them, and we know of many raids on
                        garrisons, police posts, and convoys in which the insurgents captured
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents appear to have sufficient small arms, but frequently run short
                        of ammunition. Because of its range and the availability of ammunition, the
                        British World War II Lee-Enfield is their favorite weapon. Large numbers of
                        Soviet-made AK–47 assault rifles have come into insurgent hands since the
                        Marxist takeover, as have a growing number of West German designed G–2
                        rifles (manufactured in Pakistan under license for the Pakistan Army and
                        also a standard Iranian Army weapon). The insurgents have also captured
                        machine guns, mortars, anti-aircraft weapons, and even tanks and artillery
                        from the Army, but these are generally in short supply. The difficulty of
                        moving and maintaining heavy equipment such as tanks and artillery severely
                        limits their usefulness. The insurgents also produce some of their own
                        material—for example they convert plumbing pipe and pressure cookers into
                        landmines and refill old shell casings to make new ammunition.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents have used their weapons effectively, quickly adapting their
                        tactics to new arms—such as antitank rockets—and using unfamiliar captured
                        heavy weapons with some effect (partly because soldiers trained in their use
                        defected). They have even had a technical advantage over the Soviets in one
                        area—rifle accuracy and range. Although the Lee-Enfield’s rate of fire is
                        much slower than the AK–47s, its accuracy and range makes it superior in the
                        typical clash in which only a few shots are exchanged.</p>
                    <p>Some of the most effective insurgent weapons—notably antitank rockets and
                        modern landmines—can only be obtained abroad. In addition, the gradual
                        drying up of the Afghan Army as a source of weapons—controls on weapons and
                        ammunition seem to be tightening, and desertions are slowing down as the
                        army becomes smaller—has made foreign sources more important even for small
                        arms and ammunition.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan has been the major outside source of arms. The gun markets in tribal
                        areas near the border have supplied weapons to both Afghan and Pakistani
                        tribesmen for decades. Most of the weapons <pb n="827" facs="0872" xml:id="pg_827"/>made by the tribal gun makers are rifles and pistols,
                        but they also produce mortars and heavy machine guns in small quantities.
                        Weapons produced in foreign countries—including captured Soviet weapons sold
                        to gun dealers by insurgents—and weapons presumably stolen from the
                        Pakistani military and police are also available.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents have been supplied with arms by private Pakistanis and
                        Pakistani religious organizations, although the tribal gun markets have
                        apparently been the source of much of this equipment as well.</p>
                    <p>The Pakistani Government has furnished limited quantities of ammunition,
                        rifles, antitank rockets, and mines. Saudi Arabia and several of the smaller
                        Gulf oil producers have provided funds for purchasing arms, although
                        apparently not the arms themselves. Egypt has also offered help to the
                        insurgents, and some Egyptian-made weapons reportedly are being used in
                        Afghanistan. There are persistent, but unconfirmed, reports of Chinese
                        assistance, either directly or through the Pakistani Government.</p>
                    <p>Some military supplies—most from stocks sold to Iran by the US—have been
                        supplied through Iran. Despite its announcements of support for the
                        insurgents, the role of the Iranian Government appears to be slight. The
                        weapons apparently are supplied primarily by religious organizations.</p>
                    <p>Hundreds of passes are available to the insurgents to move weapons into
                        Afghanistan over the mountainous border with Pakistan. The border with Iran
                        and the western part of the Pakistani border are largely inhospitable
                        desert, most of it unpatrolled. The government forces have firm control of
                        only the few main border crossings, such as the paved road from Iran to
                        Herat, and the road through the Khyber Pass. Soviet mining efforts along the
                        border in Konarha province have made cross-border movement there
                        considerably more difficult, but so far at least, most of the border remains
                        virtually unpatrolled.</p>
                    <p>Within Afghanistan, military supplies move slowly, by animal or man, over
                        mountain trails, the same ones used before the war by smugglers, or
                        sometimes by bus or truck. The process can be slow—insurgents in Vardak
                        province report it takes two weeks to a month to receive arms from Pakistan.
                        Despite efforts to impede movement in some provinces, government and Soviet
                        forces do not seem to have much success in interrupting insurgent arms
                        shipments in the country. Only rarely do government reports reflect the
                        interception of an arms shipment.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Badakshan</p>
                        <p>Government control of Badakshan, perhaps the most remote of Afghanistan’s
                            provinces, has always been tenuous, and the government and the Soviets
                            appear to control only the main road from Qonduz to Feyzabad, the
                            provincial capital, and the valley from Feyzabad south to Jorm. Even
                            this degree of control, however, represents an improvement from the
                            government position at the time of the Soviet invasion. The government
                            then controlled only Feyzabad, where the garrison was surrounded and
                            close to surrendering before Soviet troops came to their relief in early
                            February. A major clearing operation in June—possibly the largest staged
                            so far by the Soviets—extended control beyond the Feyzabad area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Konarha</p>
                        <p>At the time of the invasion, the government position in Konarha was
                            desperate. The few isolated posts it held were besieged and in danger of
                            falling. The major garrison in the province—at Asmar—had defected in
                            August after being besieged intermittently for six months. The
                            Nuristanis of the province resisted the government primarily out of
                            religious beliefs, although cultural differences with most other Afghans
                            probably made them even more resentful of control from Kabul than most
                            tribesmen.</p>
                        <p>Since that time, at least two major Soviet sweep operations in March and
                            May in the Konar Valley in the southern part of the province have
                            improved the situation. Asmar has been retaken, and the main villages in
                            the province are in danger from insurgents. In the main valley, movement
                            along roads is still hazardous but is at least possible for armed
                            government convoys. Although insurgent activity resumed quickly after
                            each Soviet sweep, the insurgents have not been able to regain their
                            complete control in the countryside. The more rugged and <pb n="829" facs="0874" xml:id="pg_829"/>less important northern part of the
                            province has been untouched by Soviet or government forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laghman</p>
                        <p>Much of the fighting in Laghman province has been a spillover from other
                            provinces. For example, during the Soviet sweeps in the Konar Valley,
                            there were parallel operations by Afghan and Soviet forces in Laghman.
                            Although the government controls the provincial capital and most main
                            towns, the bulk of the province is in rebel hands. Rebel fortunes have
                            fluctuated there, depending on the degree of government pressure. The
                            main significance of the province has been its use by the insurgents as
                            both a base and a supply route for operations in the Kabul area. The
                            Alisang Valley has been particularly important as a route for insurgents
                            moving to the Panjshir Valley, from which they can threaten important
                            installations—the main road to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Bagram air base—in the northern Kabul basin.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Parvan</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have been able to maintain control over the most important
                            areas of Parvan province—the northern part of the Kabul basin and the
                            Salang tunnel on the road from Kabul to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The insurgents have failed to block or destroy the
                            tunnel, the most vulnerable part of the Soviet supply line, and their
                            attacks on Bagram air base as well as mutinies by Afghan airmen there
                            have not seriously interfered with Soviet operations.</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere in the province, the insurgents have more than held their own.
                            According to one Afghan official, they control nine of the province’s 10
                            districts. Several Afghan and Soviet efforts to clear the road running
                            west into Bamian province have brought no lasting benefits. Attempts to
                            eliminate the threat to the Kabul basin posed by insurgents at the
                            Panjshir Valley in the eastern part of the province have been
                            unsuccessful. In April, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] the insurgents—perhaps for the only time since
                            the invasion—were able to force Soviet troops to retreat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Kabul</p>
                        <p>Insurgents have been active in the mountains around the Kabul basin, but
                            the basin itself has been under firm control of Soviet and government
                            forces. Clearing operations in the mountains in June seemed to have
                            removed the threat of an insurgent attack on the nation’s capital, if
                            any such threat ever existed. The Soviets may have reacted quickly and
                            forcefully because they feared that increased raids from the mountains
                            would inspire new outbreaks in the city.</p>
                        <p>The capital was fairly calm before the Soviet invasion, although the
                            first stages of an insurgent assassination campaign had already <pb n="830" facs="0875" xml:id="pg_830"/>begun a few weeks earlier.
                            Since December, assassinations have become commonplace, some estimate 10
                            to 15 every day, and there have been a number of significant civil
                            disturbances. The most serious was a six-day general strike in late
                            February which involved serious rioting and forced the Soviets to move
                            troops into the city. Student demonstrations in May and June were less
                            serious, and the Soviets left most of the responsibility for putting
                            them down to Afghan police and soldiers. Adding to the unsettled
                            conditions in the city is the fighting between the two factions of the
                            ruling party, and a fair proportion of the incidents are probably
                            attributable to their feuding, rather than to the insurgents.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vardak</p>
                        <p>Except for a few main towns and the Kabul-Qandahar road, almost all of
                            Vardak province is under control of the insurgents. Soviet operations
                            there seem to be increasing, probably both to ensure control of the road
                            and to weaken the threat to Kabul. Insurgents from the province almost
                            certainly were involved in the fighting around Kabul in June.</p>
                        <p>In February, the US Embassy acquired far more detailed information about
                            the insurgency in Vardak than has been available for any other province.
                            Insurgent leaders—calling themselves governors—were in complete control
                            there; the population supported the fight against the Soviets as a holy
                            war. The Soviet invasion had ended the longstanding rivalry between the
                            Hazaras in the west and the Pathans in the east. There was, however,
                            apparently little thought of cooperation with insurgents elsewhere in
                            the country, despite a belief that all Afghans would rise and drive out
                            the invaders. Arms and ammunition were obtained from Pakistan by
                            Vardakis dispatched to the tribal gun markets. Afghan exile
                            organizations evidently did little more than act as middlemen in the

                        <p>Insurgents in Lowgar province have been able to block roads there, and
                            have probably contributed to forces operating in Kabul province. Aside
                            from some road clearing operations—designed to keep open communications
                            with Gardez in Paktia province—there has been little significant
                            fighting there.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nangarhar</p>
                        <p>Prior to the Soviet invasion, insurgency in Nangarhar was limited
                            primarily to the northern and southern fringes of the province, where
                            fighting in Konar, Laghman, and Paktia provinces spilled over. The
                            situation was growing more critical late last year, however, with
                            insurgents for the first time able to block traffic on the road from
                            Kabul to the Khyber Pass for extended periods. (The main insurgent
                            activity <pb n="831" facs="0876" xml:id="pg_831"/>against the road,
                            however, was near Sarubi in eastern Kabul province.) Conditions in
                            Jalalabad had also begun deteriorating, and part of the Jalalabad
                            garrison mutinied in October 1979. Nevertheless, Nangarhar was the most
                            peaceful of the provinces along Afghanistan’s eastern border and the
                            scene of one of the few unqualified Afghan Army successes, the defeat of
                            a large band of Pathan Mohmand tribesmen who had invaded the province
                            from Pakistan in June 1979.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet invasion brought a major increase in insurgency both in
                            Jalalabad and in the countryside. Jalalabad airport was attacked several
                            times, the city was unsafe for Soviet or Afghan soldiers for weeks at a
                            time, and rural insurgents seized control from government officials in
                            most districts. The Soviets stationed troops permanently on the
                            outskirts of Jalalabad to keep the main road to Pakistan open, to assist
                            Afghan troops in rural districts, and to support operations in the Konar
                            Valley. Insurgents have been driven from some districts, and the road is
                            now usually open. Government authority in Jalalabad city has increased,
                            but unrest in the province is greater than before the Soviet
                            invasion.</p>

                                Communist takeover, there have been changes in provincial
                                boundaries, the most important of which was the formation of Paktika
                                province from parts of Paktia and Ghazni provinces. To avoid
                                confusion, the pre-Communist provincial boundaries have been used
                                throughout this paper. [Footnote is in the original.]</note></p>
                        <p>The first resistance to the Marxists broke out among the Mangal tribe in
                            eastern Paktia province within a week of the coup in April 1978.
                            Fighting quickly spread, and prior to the Soviet invasion, the
                            government’s counterinsurgency problems were more serious in Paktia than
                            in any other province except Konarha. Control was limited to a few
                            garrisons. In October 1979, Afghan troops—apparently commanded by Soviet
                            officers—staged the only major Afghan offensive of the war. Although
                            Afghan units reached their geographic objectives, they established no
                            permanent control. Within days the insurgents were once again in control
                            of most of the province, and government forces were besieged in a few
                            isolated posts. Some analysts have argued that the failure of this
                            offensive was one factor in Moscow’s decision that Afghanistan could be
                            saved only by Soviet troops.</p>
                        <p>Since the invasion, there has been little military activity in the
                            province. Government garrisons are isolated and seem to do their best to
                            avoid actions likely to bring an insurgent response. In June, however,
                            there was a significant Soviet incursion into the province, probably in
                            battalion strength, in an apparent effort to open roads to the main
                            garrisons. The Pathans responded by ambushing Soviet columns at <pb n="832" facs="0877" xml:id="pg_832"/>several places and inflicting
                            some casualties. Since then, the province has remained fairly calm.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ghazni</p>
                        <p>The Pathans of Ghazni province did not become a serious problem for the
                            government until the spring of 1979, but by late that year the city of
                            Ghazni was besieged, and several smaller garrisons in the southern part
                            of the province were forced to surrender or defect. The insurgents were
                            able to block the main road from Qandahar to Kabul at will; some
                            government officials traveling on the road did so only after buying
                            passes from insurgent representatives.</p>
                        <p>Since the invasion, the Soviets have staged two major clearing operations
                            in the province aimed primarily at securing the road. The first was in
                            April and May, and the second is still under way. The first, according
                            to Afghan exiles, inflicted severe casualties on innocent villagers in
                            the southern part of the province. The current operation, both larger
                            and with a larger proportion of Soviet troops, began in mid-July, and
                            its initial stages were apparently complicated by a mutiny in the Afghan
                            garrison at Ghazni. The Soviets have been able to keep the road open for
                            convoys most of the time, and there has been no serious insurgent threat
                            to Ghazni city since the invasion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Zabol</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have made little effort to deal with insurgency in most of
                            Zabol province and have left most of the responsibility for keeping the
                            Kabul-Qandahar road open to Afghan forces. As a result, insurgents
                            control most of the province and have been able to block the road in the
                            Qalat area repeatedly.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Qandahar</p>
                        <p>Insurgency in rural Qandahar has been less serious for the Soviets than
                            unrest in the provincial capital, the country’s second largest city. For
                            much of the time since the invasion, the city has been unsafe for
                            government officials and has been virtually under control of the
                            insurgents, especially after dark. At least twice, despite Soviet
                            reluctance to engage in urban fighting, Soviet troops have been sent in
                            to restore some semblance of government control. Elsewhere in the
                            province insurgency has been greatest along the Pakistani border north
                            of Spin Baldak and along the border with Oruzgun province. The
                            government has tended to ignore the desolate southern part of the
                            province.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bamian, Oruzgun, and Ghowr</p>
                        <p>Bamian, Oruzgun, and Ghowr provinces in central Afghanistan are inhabited
                            largely by Hazaras, a Mongolian Shiah minority long the <pb n="833" facs="0878" xml:id="pg_833"/>object of discrimination on both ethnic
                            and religious grounds. The area originally fell to the insurgents almost
                            by default. The Afghan military, concentrating on Pathan insurgency in
                            the east, could spare few troops to hold the Hazara area, and since the
                            summer of 1978, all of the area except for the main towns has been in
                            insurgent hands. Government operations were largely confined to the
                            relief of threatened posts and a few half-hearted efforts that opened
                            the road between Kabul and Herat for only brief periods.</p>
                        <p>There has been little change since the invasion. The Hazaras have kept up
                            pressure on government forces. For their part, the Soviets have left the
                            area primarily to the Afghan Army. Their one major incursion into the
                            area, a multibattalion offensive in late April, may have been designed
                            partly to demonstrate that the Soviets could move into the area. Within
                            a few days after the end of the clearing operation, the Hazaras appear
                            to have regained all they held previously.</p>
                        <p>Despite their control of the countryside, the Hazaras have been unable to
                            take major towns. Tarin Kowt in Oruzgun has been under pressure for well
                            over a year, Chaghcharan has been isolated as long, and insurgents have
                            penetrated Bamian’s defenses, but none of the three provincial capitals
                            has been taken and held.</p>
                        <p>The motivation of the Hazaras in fighting the government and the Soviets
                            is somewhat different than that of other Afghans. It results in part
                            from past discrimination, and from their resentment of the dominance of
                            the Marxist governments (as well as all their predecessors) by Sunni
                            Pathans. The Hazaras also have probably been inspired and influenced
                            more by the Iranian revolution than other Afghans, apparently gaining
                            renewed pride in their Shiism. Iran has, however, been an inspiration to
                            Sunni Afghans, too; pictures of <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Ayatollah
                                Khomeini</persName> have been posted in Sunni cities such as Qonduz.
                            Hazara resentments have played a part in urban unrest in Kabul, where
                            Hazaras have been in the forefront of anti-government activity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Baghlan</p>
                        <p>In Baghlan province the insurgents have staged sporadic attacks against
                            Soviet convoys and, despite Soviet clearing operations, they control the
                            relatively unimportant eastern part of the province. The Soviets,
                            nevertheless, have been able to keep the main road open—their major
                            objective in the province—to control all major towns, and to establish a
                            major logistic base at the important crossroad at Pol-e-Khomri.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Takar</p>
                        <p>Takar province was not a serious problem for the government prior to the
                            Soviet invasion, but insurgency has increased there since. In <pb n="834" facs="0879" xml:id="pg_834"/>late June, the provincial
                            governor reported that most districts were in insurgent hands and that
                            an attack on the provincial capital was imminent. Judging by military
                            operations there, the situation has not been quite so critical
                            recently—the Soviets have been able to rely largely on Afghan troops—and
                            insurgency is strongest in the remote southern part of the province.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Qonduz</p>
                        <p>There was only minor insurgency in Qonduz province before the Soviet
                            invasion, but since then it has been a serious problem for the Soviets.
                            Although the province is important because it contains the major river
                            port at Shir Khan on the Soviet-Afghan border and the road south toward
                            Kabul, the Soviets initially left security there to Afghan forces. By
                            March, insurgents had taken control of most of the countryside, and
                            urban dissidents were in virtual control of the provincial capital. In
                            April Soviet troops moved into the capital, conducted clearing
                            operations in the province, and restored some semblance of order.
                            Insurgency, nevertheless, is at a considerably higher level than before
                            last December. At no time does there appear to have been a threat to
                            Shir Khan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Samangan</p>
                        <p>Samangan was one of the country’s quieter provinces before the Soviet
                            invasion. By June, faced with weak Afghan forces, the insurgents were
                            strong enough to attack the provincial capital twice in a single day.
                            Insurgent control appears to be strongest in the south, in part because
                            of the presence of Hazaras from neighboring Bamian.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Balkh</p>
                        <p>Balkh has been among the quietest of Afghanistan’s provinces despite
                            sporadic dissidence, especially in the southern part of the province.
                            There have been assassinations, strikes, and sabotage in Mazar-i-Sharif,
                            the provincial capital and the country’s fourth largest city, but much
                            less unrest than in Kabul, Herat, or Qandahar.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Jowzjan</p>
                        <p>In Jowzjan, like most of the northern provinces, the most serious
                            insurgency has been in the south. The weakness of government forces,
                            however, has allowed the insurgents to gain control of much of the
                            province and on occasion threaten the provincial capital.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Faryab</p>
                        <p>The situation is much the same in Faryab, where the government’s main
                            military concerns have been with insurgency along the southern part of
                            its border with Jowzjan province, and the threat from insurgents in
                            Badghisat.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Badghisat</p>
                        <p>A sudden burst of insurgency in Badghisat province in March 1979 caught
                            the small government forces off guard. Since then the insurgents have
                            controlled much of the province, but not the major towns. They
                            apparently tried to advance on Meymaneh, in Faryab province, but troops
                            rushed from Mazar-i-Sharif stopped them near the provincial border. A
                            Soviet clearing operation in July 1980 appears to have won some ground
                            for the government, but the gain may be only temporary.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Herat</p>
                        <p>In March 1979, the city of Herat was the scene of the first major urban
                            uprising against the Afghan Marxists. Crowds using tactics patterned
                            after those that brought down the Shah were joined by part of the local
                            Afghan Army garrison. Although the rising was suppressed in a few days,
                            calm never returned completely to the city. Following the Soviet
                            invasion, it was reduced to anarchy by strikes, demonstrations,
                            assassinations, and armed clashes. Soviet troops have held important
                            installations there, such as the airport, but have moved into the city
                            only on a few occasions to prevent insurgents from gaining complete
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Insurgency has been less a problem in the remainder of the province.
                            Small bands—some operating from Iranian territory—have clashed with
                            government forces, sometimes taking isolated posts, but Afghan forces,
                            with only some help from the Soviets, have prevented significant
                            insurgent success.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Farah</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have established a major military base at Shindand air base,
                            and have some degree of control in the central part of the province.
                            Nevertheless, insurgent attacks on convoys on the Herat-Qandahar road
                            have become so serious that most Afghan truckers refuse to use it.
                            Soviet control is more tenuous along the Iranian border, and Soviet
                            clearing operations in the eastern part of the province have met strong
                            resistance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nimruz</p>
                        <p>Sparsely settled Nimruz experienced almost no insurgency before the
                            Soviet invasion, but in March the insurgents—opposed mainly by
                            demoralized police—gained control of most of the countryside and almost
                            seized the provincial capital. The dispatch of a few companies of Afghan
                            troops and a smaller number of Soviets prevented further insurgent
                            gains. The Soviets apparently are planning a more ambitious clearing
                            operation, but it is unlikely they consider the province important
                            enough to spare enough troops to do more than relieve pressure on a few
                            posts.</p>

                        <p>The settled farmers along the Heland river have engaged in little
                            antigovernment activity. Although they are Pathans, their tribal martial
                            tradition is much weaker than among mountain dwellers. Because they
                            depend on government irrigation projects—largely funded by the US—they
                            are among the few Afghans who regard the central government as a
                            benefactor instead of an enemy. Since the Soviet invasion, attacks on
                            government installations have increased, the government has lost control
                            of many of the non-riverine districts, and local officials fear that the
                            provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, may be attacked.</p>

                        <p>There are dozens of Afghan exile organizations, most of them based in
                            Pakistan, some in Iran, and the rest scattered throughout the world (the
                            US, Western Europe, Egypt, India). Apart from those in Pakistan and
                            Iran, they have a very limited impact on the insurgency.</p>

                                (<gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss>). This umbrella organization
                            was formed by the six most important exile groups in Peshawar in January
                            1980 to enable the exile groups to present a united front at the special
                            Islamic Foreign Ministers Conference held in Islamabad in late January.
                            It also hoped to encourage aid from Muslim countries that objected to
                            the fragmentation of the insurgent movement. One group, the Islamic
                            Party, left the Alliance while it was being established. The <gloss target="#t_IALA_1">IALA</gloss> is headed by Abdul Rasoul Saif, who
                            was apparently chosen because he posed no threat to the ambitions of the
                            leaders of the five remaining member organizations.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">The Afghan Islamic League</hi>
                            (Jamiat-Islami-Afghani). The League is headed by Burhanuddin Rabbani, a
                            former professor at Kabul University. The organization reportedly
                            receives financial support from a small, conservative political party in
                            Pakistan and is closer to the Afghan National Liberation Front than to
                            the other members of the Alliance. Rabbani’s group reportedly has a
                            military arm, but its capability is unknown.</p>

                            (Jabhe-i-Negat-i-Melli). The group’s leader, Sebqatullah Mojededi, is a
                            member of an important religious family that has a following in Kabul

                            the exile Muslim leader with the most modern outlook, <persName corresp="#p_GSA_1">Gailani</persName>’s political strength is based
                            on his religious following.</p>

                            is a splinter group of <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hekmatyar</persName>’s organization (see below). Its tough, combative
                            leader, Younis Khalis, is reported to be admired by other exile leaders
                            for his courage in leading his band in cross-border operations into
                            Afghanistan. Conservative and reputedly without political ambitions, he
                            has prodded other groups to become more involved in the fighting in
                            Afghanistan.</p>

                            revolution in 1978. One report alleges that he has 15,000 guerrillas in
                            Afghanistan. This is probably an exaggeration, but the Islamic Party is
                            one of the best organized and most active exile organizations. <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hekmatyar</persName>’s group has its roots in the
                            area between Ghazni and Qandahar, and it is active there as well as in
                            the Kabul area and in the eastern provinces bordering Pakistan. The
                            Islamic Party has an office in Tehran, as well as its main office in
                            Peshawar. <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hekmatyar</persName> rejects the
                            monarchy and is reportedly impressed by the fundamentalist revolution in

                    <p>—Reports of the use of chemical agents in Afghanistan have never been
                        conclusive, at least those we have seen. Our own sourcing and that of our

                        heavily on the nearly identical accounts by refugees who have come across
                        the border from different places, all of which point to some sort of
                        canisters dropped by Soviet aircraft and the emission from those canisters
                        of some gas or cloud which appears to debilitate those in the area for
                        several hours. Deaths, if any, seem an accidental by-product for those too
                        close to the source of the emission, and thus far we have no hard evidence
                        of burning or other longer-term effects.</p>
                    <p>—We have had no such reports recently, i.e., in the last two months;
                        moreover, our efforts to obtain a canister have borne no fruit.</p>
                    <p>—We have proposed to the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> the despatch of
                        a team of medical specialists whose efforts will be directed at attempting
                        to document such use of chemical agents by the Soviets; that documentation
                        effort, if successful, is not likely to be available for some time.</p>
                    <p>4. I have also some concern that the Pakistan Representative in Geneva may
                        not fully reflect the position of his government on Pakistan’s willingness
                        to play a prominent role in international forums on the chemical warfare
                        issue or be willing to co-sponsor resolutions in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> or elsewhere on this subject. I would
                        feel somewhat more confident were I to be instructed to approach the Foreign
                        Ministry here for general review of this subject before we seek active
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                    <p>5. Given the lack of conclusive evidence, at least in the public domain, I
                        think we (and the Government of Pakistan) should reflect hard about how wise
                        it is to push this subject so that we do not, by the deficiencies of our
                        public case on chemical warfare in Afghanistan, undermine the more
                        persuasive case we have on aggression, brutalties, and atrocities
                        perpetrated by the Soviets during their Afghan adventure.</p>

                        <salute>Distinguished Mr. Secretary,</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I accquainted myself with your letter of August 5, in which You again return
                        to the questions concerning Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d307">Document 307</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Let me be frank, the way You are posing these questions can not but elicit
                        puzzlement. For instance, what is the reason for the persistant attempt of
                        the American side to cast doubt on the fact of withdrawal from Afghanistan
                        of certain Soviet units? It is clear after all, that such ignoring of facts
                        not only serves no constructive purpose but voids the dialogue of any sense
                        altogether.</p>
                    <p>Nor can in any way the progress in the political settlement of the situation
                        around Afghanistan be facilitated by the persistently repeated assertion
                        that “central factor” of the settlement is the question of complete
                        withdrawal of Soviet forces.</p>
                    <p>What, indeed, is and continues to be the central question is the question of
                        cessation and guaranteed non-resumption of military incursions from outside
                        into the territory of Afghanistan and, generally, of all forms of
                        interference in its internal affairs. It is in this context, as has been
                        stated by us on more than one occasion, the solution of the question of
                        withdrawal of the Soviet military contingent from Afghanistan can be
                        achieved. In other words, this question is of a derivative and not of a
                        principal nature at all. For the Soviet troops to be withdrawn from
                        Afghanistan the reason which induced the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Government to ask the Soviet Union for military assistance
                        must be eliminated. There have been and can be no changes in our position in
                        this respect.</p>
                    <p>A specific program of political settlement which, if realized, would lead to
                        normalization of relations between Afghanistan and its neighbors as well as
                        to solution of other pertinent questions, was, with utmost clarity, spelled
                        out in the known statement of the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss>

                        part, gives support to that program.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>Moscow is able to launch small-scale air and ground incursions into Pakistan
                        at any time, but this does not appear to be Soviet policy at present. Since
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late December, two ground incursions
                        and 14 air incursions have been confirmed, only one of which appeared to be
                        deliberate. Moreover, high-level Soviet authorities have expressed concern
                        about some of the confirmed incidents and as late as mid-May were
                        investigating them. In fact, the Soviet presence appears to have reduced the
                        number of air and ground incursions into Pakistan to below the number
                        allegedly made by Afghan forces before the invasion. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Pakistani officials, however, believe that at least some of the incidents
                        were staged by the Soviets to put pressure on Islamabad. On 3 <pb n="842" facs="0887" xml:id="pg_842"/>March, they made strong diplomatic and
                        public protests following an air violation in which a Soviet aircraft
                        apparently penetrated some 20 to 40 kilometers into Pakistan. Subsequently,
                        in mid-May, Pakistani personnel reportedly fired on intruding aircraft and
                        on Soviet-Afghan forces in confirmed ground incursions. Pakistan has
                        steadily but discreetly increased its military readiness opposite
                        Afghanistan in hopes of deterring more serious Soviet and Afghan incursions.
                            ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviets probably will increase their efforts to seal the Pakistani border
                        on the Afghan side rather than alter their policy of restraint. If this
                        fails, the Soviets may authorize a campaign of sustained small-scale air
                        penetrations or border incursions to force Pakistan to stop supporting the
                        insurgents. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling
                            restriction not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Pakistani authorities expect a Soviet-Afghan ground incursion; a few believe
                        it might occur as early as this fall. Pakistan’s efforts to reinforce the
                        Afghan border will probably continue but may be complicated by a shortage of
                        military equipment and by substantial high-level Army resistance to
                        redeployments that would weaken Pakistani defenses on the Indian border.

                    <p>Moscow’s increased pressure on Islamabad may stem from a belief that the

                    <p rend="center">(U) CHINESE AND US OBJECTIVES IN SOUTHWEST ASIA</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Summary</hi></p>
                    <p>(C) China and the US have some common objectives in Southwest Asia, the most
                        important of which is coordination of international efforts to oppose Soviet
                        actions in Afghanistan and prevent further destabilization of the area.
                        During recent months Beijing has consulted extensively with Washington on
                        the Southwest Asian situation, and Washington has expressed support for
                        certain Chinese policies. The US has agreed, for example, that the Chinese
                        should encourage Pakistan and Iran to coordinate their efforts to oppose the
                        Soviet presence in Afghanistan. It has also agreed with Beijing’s attempts
                        to improve ties with New Delhi and advise Southwest Asian states to compose
                        their differences and move toward regional security cooperation.</p>
                    <p>(S) But China displays a considerably more confrontationist style toward the
                        Soviet Union than does the United States. Beijing has pressed the US in
                        recent months to adopt policies, such as security guarantees to Pakistan and
                        military support to the Afghan resistance, that Washington considers unwise.
                        Other differences are evident between Chinese and US policy perspectives.
                        For example, Beijing has made clear that its confidence in US perceptiveness
                        and resolve is low and that China fears that US action in Iran, or inaction
                        in Afghanistan, will encourage Soviet aggression.</p>
                    <p>(S) Thus, despite China’s statements that it is willing to take parallel
                        actions in Southwest Asia when Sino-US views are identical, as a practical
                        matter it has been careful to avoid too close an identification with even
                        those US policies it fully supports.</p>
                    <p>(C) The US has preferred to pursue Sino-US cooperation in the form of
                        agreements and mutual consultation rather than by joint action. Indeed,
                        owing to differing views of the Soviet Union and to China’s emergence as a
                        regional power, the confluence of Chinese and American objectives in
                        Southwest Asia could prove to be a temporary phenomenon.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Elections</hi>. After some mutual comparison of recent
                        vacation travels—his in the Baltic and mine in California and Arizona—the
                        conversation turned to the current campaign. As far as the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was concerned, it made little difference
                        who won in November, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>
                        said. When I expressed surprise at this statement, given Governor <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s position on the Soviet Union and
                        on a whole range of security issues, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> conceded that the President was logically the
                        preferable candidate for Moscow because of his approach to arms control
                        questions. “<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> directly opposes
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> does not,” <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said. But as seen from Moscow the difference
                        between the two candidates on defense matters is unimportant. Soviet defense
                        analysts feel that the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration has done as much as any American government can do to
                        increase defense expenditures and strongly doubt that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> would allocate more for defense
                        over the next two fiscal years than <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has, Bessmertynkh said, and particularly if he cuts
                        taxes. (C)</p>
                    <p>It is true, Bessmertynkh continued, that a sober and straightforward
                        comparison of the positions which the two candidates have adopted would seem
                        to make <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> preferable for us.
                        But speaking entirely informally and off the record, it is simply a fact
                        that the President is viscerally disliked in Moscow and that this dislike is
                        widely shared both by the general Soviet public and by official circles.
                        There were two recent events that strongly influenced this Soviet attitude.
                        The first was the decision to try and implement a world-wide boycott of the
                        Olympics. This was very bad, and it was deeply resented because it was not
                        seen as a serious way for the superpowers to do business. In fact, it
                        engendered a feeling of national resentment within the Soviet populace, who
                        were then extremely gratified at the great success of the Olympics. The
                        other matter which was a subject of great irritation within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was the President’s statement that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> had lied <pb n="846" facs="0891" xml:id="pg_846"/>to him over the hot line.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">For the exchange of hotline messages, see <ref target="#d113">Documents 113</ref> and <ref target="#d114">114</ref>. In his press conference on April 13, <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, noting several nations’ calls
                            for Soviet troop withdrawal, said: “We would support this effort. But
                            the Soviets, contrary to the assurance given to me by <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> and given to, I know, at
                            least, President <persName corresp="#p_GDV_1">Giscard</persName> by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>, have not withdrawn
                            their troops. In my judgement, they have no inclination to withdraw
                            their troops; they’ve shown no evidence of that.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>,
                                1980–81</hi>, Book I, p. 674)</note> It received attention at high
                        levels. It was only after this that the Soviet media was allowed to portray
                        the President any way it chose. (C)</p>
                    <p>This was extremely shortsighted, I replied, and was not appropriate behavior
                        for a great power. I have been reading the Soviet press for twenty years and
                        I had never seen Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, or <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> castigated in such terms as the
                        Soviet press has adopted toward the President. This was foolish not only
                        because of the umbrage which American officials feel when we read such
                        distortions, but in terms of the effect which such tendentious reporting can
                        have within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> itself. I find it
                        really deplorable, I said. (C)</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> answered that he
                        entirely agreed with me. Within his memory he also had never seen anything
                        like it. It was unnecessary and gratuitous and he had personally complained
                        about it to Moscow, characterizing it as an unwise policy. But once Soviet
                        journalists are given their head in a matter like this, they can really go
                        to extremes. And the constant barbs and pricking points which have been
                        directed at the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> since this
                        administration took over have had their effect, he added. (C)</p>
                    <p>I asked whether the Soviet Embassy keeps in touch with <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s foreign policy advisers. They had
                        made no attempt to do so, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> replied, although a Soviet diplomat had
                        attended Richard Allen’s briefing for the diplomatic corps. The point of the
                        briefing, according to <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>,
                        was to reassure foreign diplomats that the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> administration would adopt a responsible course of
                        action in world affairs. In any case, the Soviet embassy had been in contact
                        with a great many Republicans during previous administrations and was sure
                        that such acquaintanceships could be renewed in short order. US-Soviet
                        relations are the most important elements of international relations,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said, and the
                        Soviets were confident that they could work with any American
                        administration, no matter who was President. (C)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>. Turning to Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> stressed that the image being
                        conveyed in the United States of the Soviets being “mired” in a hopeless
                        Vietnam-like mess in Afghanistan was totally incorrect and very unfortunate.
                        It leads to a widespread hope that Soviet forces would soon be withdrawn and
                        all talk of a Soviet with<pb n="847" facs="0892" xml:id="pg_847"/>drawal is
                        illusory, he said. It will simply not take place, except perhaps in the very
                        distant future. To base United States policy on the hope of achieving a near
                        term withdrawal was, to say the least, ill-advised. Such a policy has the
                        effect of freezing US-Soviet relations for the indefinite future.
                        Furthermore, the repeated insistence on a “transition” period in various
                        letters from Washington to Moscow on this subject really raises hackles in
                        the upper levels of the foreign ministry, including <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>. By “transition” you obviously
                        mean the replacement of the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> government. But Babrak is stronger every day. There is
                        not the slightest chance of the Soviet Union abandoning him. If you think
                        otherwise, then the intelligence you are receiving is highly suspect.
                        (S)</p>
                    <p>Everything we receive, from whatever source—including various statements made
                        by the Kabul Regime itself—contradicts the assertion that Babrak is growing
                        stronger, I replied. Not only did he not seem to be in control of the
                        country, but his dominance of the Party was very much in doubt. Our
                        intelligence analysts believe that the Khalq faction of the Party clearly
                        outnumbered Babrak’s Parchamists. It was therefore our assumption that if
                        the Soviet Union withdrew its support, Babrak would immediately be thrown
                        out on his ear. In any case, it seems apparent to us that Babrak entirely
                        lacks a popular base, and only has the support of a miniscule percentage of
                        the population. (S)</p>
                    <p>People used to say the same thing about the Bolsheviks, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> rejoined. I am no expert in
                        this area, but I can assure you that the intelligence we receive is
                        encouraging. We control a great deal more of the countryside than your press
                        would have you believe. It is obvious to us that the United States will have
                        to accept this sooner or later. In order to achieve a resolution of the
                        situation, you will have to stop supporting rebel elements through some of
                        your Muslim friends. Once the rebels stop receiving outside assistance the
                        problem is resolved. During the Vietnam War the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> adopted a wise policy of initiating and continuing on with
                        an era of detente no matter what was taking place in Southeast Asia. (S)</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union should recognize, I replied, that we are exercising enormous
                        restraint in Afghanistan. If the United States wished to upgrade the
                        equipment, the training, and the overall effectiveness of the Muslim forces
                        over what they are at present, it could do so easily. As for the Vietnam
                        War, it was the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> which supplied the
                        wherewithal for the Vietnamese to inflict enormous casualties, including
                        45,000 dead, on United States forces. It was therefore not the Soviet Union

                        War, but rather the United States. (S)</p>
                    <p>In any case, in Afghanistan all we ask is that you accept reality and not
                        base policy on wishful thinking, said <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName>. There <pb n="848" facs="0893" xml:id="pg_848"/>may be those within the United States bureaucracy who argue that it is in
                        your interest to see the Soviets “mired down” in Afghanistan. We had people
                        like that in Moscow who made the same argument regarding the United States
                        during the Vietnam War. But the whole thrust of our policy was nevertheless
                        to end that war. We behaved as a superpower should, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> said. You think that you will
                        be able to get these people to work together. But it cannot be done. We had
                        to deal with our own Basmachi rebellion, which lasted all through the
                            20’s.<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">See <ref target="#d275fn2">footnote 2,

                        cannot trust them or get them to work together. They will lie to you. They
                        will take your money and they will not keep a bargain. We know that. We
                        could use money to buy them out if we wanted to. But we do not intend to do
                        so because we have great experience with them and know they are totally
                        untrustworthy. We have told you repeatedly that our action in Afghanistan is
                        limited in time and in scope and that it is unrelated to any other country
                        or any other region. You should accept our statements and work
                        constructively to find a solution to the current impasse between us.
                        Afghanistan in no sense infringes on the interests of the United States.

                    <p>What many observers, and not just those within the United States, fear about
                        the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan, I replied, is that if it is successful,
                        if it is regarded by the Soviet leadership, and the Soviet military, and the
                        Soviet foreign policy bureaucracy as having been a great success, then it
                        will inescapably become a precedent for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and an argument to encourage similar actions in other
                        places. Several Soviet officials have asserted in the context of Afghanistan
                        that there will be “no more Allendes.” Given the Soviet military buildup,
                        the marked increase in its ability to project its forces to distant places,
                        and the volatility of the world of the eighties, this type of irresponsible
                        statement must give any observer of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> pause. If Moscow could contemplate taking the same kind of
                        action in a place as far away as Chile as it did in Afghanistan, then this
                        will inevitably lead to the kind of confrontation that neither of us
                        desires. (S)</p>
                    <p>Soviet policy has been clearly enunciated, <persName corresp="#p_BAA_1">Bessmertnykh</persName> rejoined. You should not place too much
                        significance on isolated remarks taken out of context. We realize, of
                        course, that you have painted yourself into a corner on Afghanistan and that
                        it is very difficult for the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration to take the kind of actions that will lead to a constructive
                        resolution of the problem of restoration of US-Soviet relations. This is
                        true for us as well. Nevertheless, we cannot remain isolated from each <pb n="849" facs="0894" xml:id="pg_849"/>other forever, and if we cannot
                        return to business-as-usual, then at least let us return to business.

                        STANDING FIRM ON AFGHANISTAN</p>
                    <p>Pakistan, with a view toward the Islamic Foreign Ministers meeting in New
                        York, October 6–7, is searching for ways to retain the initiative on the
                        Afghan crisis. The three-man Islamic Conference Standing Committee (ICSC) is
                        no longer a useful vehicle. Pakistan’s diplomatic activity has led the
                        British to conclude that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> may be
                        wobbling, a view we do not share. While Pakistan is deeply concerned about
                        the degree of support that Islamabad would receive if the Soviets pressed it
                        both militarily and diplomatically, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> are not prepared to abandon their goals of a
                        broad-based regime in Kabul and the withdrawal of Soviet troops.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan is focusing on action in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to
                        keep pressure on the Soviets to withdraw their troops. Islamabad feels
                        compelled to come up with feasible proposals since Pakistan, which inscribed
                        the Afghan issue on the agenda of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        General Assembly, does not want an “unreliable” nonaligned state (e.g., Cuba
                        or India) to seize the initiative.</p>
                    <p>Current Pakistani thinking, as reflected in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] seems to be that the best alternative to the
                        now defunct ICSC is a small international conference under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> aegis. This conference might include the
                        five permanent Security Council members, Afghanistan’s regional neighbors,
                        and representatives from the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>
                        regime.</p>
                    <p>The Romanians, who have been trying to obtain agreement on holding an
                        international conference, told the Pakistanis that the Soviets could accept
                        the notion of such a meeting. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> believe that Moscow has
                        tacitly accepted this scheme.</p>
                    <p><pb n="850" facs="0895" xml:id="pg_850"/>It is not clear, however, if the
                        Soviets would go along with the type of conference that the Pakistanis are
                        advocating. The Soviet Ambassador in Islamabad told the Pakistanis that his
                        government rejected the concept of an international conference; he
                        reiterated the initial Soviet opposition to the Islamic Conference
                        resolution in May proposing such a gathering. Among the objectives of the
                        Pakistani diplomatic delegation scheduled to arrive in Moscow this weekend
                        (and led by Foreign Secretary Piracha) is clarification of Soviet views.</p>

                            Soviet and insurgent forces in Afghanistan has increased considerably.
                            Neither side probably will be able to inflict any major military setback
                            before the end of good weather in late October. If insurgent claims of
                            impending food shortages for the resistance are accurate, the winter
                            combat season could pose more problems for them than for the

                            evidence available to us. To be sure, the insurgents are no better
                            organized than when the fighting began, and they are taking heavier
                            casualties. But there are also more of them, they have better weapons,
                            and they have learned how to use them. Moreover, they usually confront
                            the Soviets only when they enjoy the military advantage.**</hi></p>

                            law. Soviet forces have been used to blockade provincial towns but
                            security in the towns themselves has been left primarily to the Afghans,

                            both sides. Soviet forces will confront the insurgents with a kind of
                            sustained military pressure not heretofore experienced. This, coupled
                            with possible food shortages, could ultimately affect the insurgents’
                            ability to continue the struggle at its present level.**</hi></p>

                    <p>On the morning of September 15, 1980, Soviet Army Private Alexandr V. Kruglov
                        arrived at the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy in Afghanistan
                        apparently requesting that the Embassy provide him asylum until he could
                        depart either for the United States or another country. At the time, no
                        Russian-speaking officials were on hand to communicate with Kruglov. During
                        a meeting in Washington later that day, Under Secretary of State for
                        Political Affairs <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David Newsom</persName> told
                        Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Anatoliy Dobrynin</persName>
                        that the United States wanted to be responsive to the Kruglov case, while at
                        the same time it sought to ensure that the matter would not “unduly
                        aggravate <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations.” <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> further noted that the issue should
                        be resolved under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for
                        Refugees, and that the United States held the Soviet Union responsible for
                        the overall security and safety of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        Embassy in Kabul. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> reported
                        that the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan, Fakriat Tabeev, and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Chargé d’Affaires <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Hawthorne Mills</persName> were meeting in Kabul
                        regarding the situation, and should the Ambassador request a meeting with
                        Kruglov, the United States would be amenable under appropriate
                        circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName> responded
                        that he knew nothing of the Kruglov matter, but would check in with Moscow.

                        cease subjecting Embassy personnel entering and exiting the premises to

                        in Kabul thought any military response would be limited to preventing
                        Kruglov’s removal from Embassy grounds; Chargé <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Mills</persName> believed an assault on the Embassy was unlikely
                        because Kruglov was not “important enough to warrant such a blatant

                    <p>In preparation for the meeting between Kruglov and Soviet officials, the
                        Department of State instructed the Embassy in Kabul that it should “not lead
                        Kruglov in any direction” and should remind him that any decision he made
                        was his alone. The Department further instructed that a meeting should not
                        take place if it was possible that Kruglov would attempt to bargain for his
                        safety in exchange for his pledge not to reveal Soviet military secrets.
                        Such a bargain was “extremely dangerous not only to him but also to the
                        future of the Mission” because such a bargain would only “increase Soviet
                        determination to get him back at all costs.” Should a meeting occur, Kruglov
                        should be made aware of his options: he could remain in the Embassy, leave
                        with the Soviet officials, or delay until he made his decision. Kruglov
                        should be permitted to leave with the Soviets, the Department instructed,
                        only if Embassy officials were convinced he was doing so on his own accord
                        and was willing to provide a handwritten statement attesting to this fact.

                    <p>On September 21, Kruglov met with Robert F. Ober, a senior Political
                        Counselor in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy in Moscow, who
                        had travelled to <pb n="854" facs="0899" xml:id="pg_854"/>Afghanistan to
                        deal with the matter. Kruglov agreed to a meeting with Soviet officials
                        later that day. He agreed he would not attempt to make a bargain for his
                        safety in exchange for withholding military secrets, and Ober assured him
                        that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> insistence on this point was of
                        benefit to both Kruglov’s well-being and the security of the Embassy.
                        Kruglov shared that he was considering bargaining for Soviet assurance that
                        he would be allowed to emigrate from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> subsequent to serving whatever sentence the authorities
                        handed him. Ober counseled that Kruglov should attempt to publicize whatever
                        assurances he received for his emigration to ensure they would be met
                        following his sentence. (Telegram 252721 to Moscow, September 21; Carter

                    <p>Kruglov’s meeting with Soviet officials took place as scheduled, September

                        side. Before Kruglov was brought in, the Soviets produced a tape recording
                        of a woman they claimed was Kruglov’s grandmother, as well as letters from
                        friends and relatives of Kruglov. Finding nothing objectionable, Ober
                        approved their presentation to Kruglov. When Kruglov was brought in,
                        Ambassador Tabeev addressed him: “We are surprised by your actions. Please
                        tell us what happened.” (Telegram 252736 to Moscow, September 21; Carter

                    <p>Kruglov responded: “What prompted me was the bad relations between our
                        officers and enlisted men. Before I came into the army I was convinced by
                        what I had read and seen on the television program ‘Serve the Soviet Union,’
                        that it would be a wonderful life. It all sounded good. But it turned out to
                        be difficult in fact. It is difficult for me to discuss this, but I could
                        tell you lots about the humiliations and indignities forced upon Soviet
                        troops.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Noting that he too served in the military, Tabeev empathized with Kruglov’s
                        complaints and promised that he could return to the Soviet Union and resume
                        his academic studies without punishment, on the basis that he had not
                        actually deserted the army, nor had he sought asylum. Tabeev further offered
                        to personally correct abuses Kruglov had suffered while serving in
                        Afghanistan, and both Tabeev and Kruglov expressed their appreciation for
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy’s assistance in allowing
                        the meeting to occur. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Upon reflection, Kruglov decided that he would leave with the Soviet
                        officials. <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Mills</persName> asked: “Was the
                        decision made without pressure, of your own free will?” Kruglov replied
                        affirmatively and committed his response to a handwritten statement.
                        Following this exchange, <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Mills</persName> asked
                        Tabeev what could be done about the Afghan Government’s blockade of the
                        Embassy. Tabeev gave a “double guarantee” of his <pb n="855" facs="0900" xml:id="pg_855"/>pledge to Kruglov and expressed his “hope that the
                        blockade issue would improve following a talk with his Afghan counterparts.

                    <p>In telegram 2670 from Kabul, September 23, the Embassy reported that the
                        Afghan Government’s barricades surrounding the Embassy were “magically”
                        removed less than an hour after Kruglov’s departure on September 21, thus
                        concluding the episode.(National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D800456–0260) No telegrams
                        reporting on Kruglov’s subsequent treatment by Soviet authorities were

                            foreign power.” (Ibid.)</note> Late that afternoon Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SMD_1">Shulman</persName> provided a <pb n="856" facs="0901" xml:id="pg_856"/>briefing at <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> for
                        Allied Reps from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ANZUS_1">ANZUS</gloss>, and Japan. (All were represented
                        except the Turks, who were unable to attend because of schedule conflicts.)
                        Highlights of the briefing follow:</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to Afghanistan.]</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>8. What <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said was basically no
                        different from his earlier statements on Afghanistan. He expressed support
                        for the May 14 Afghan proposals and stressed the importance of getting talks
                        going between Afghanistan and Pakistan and Iran.<note n="3" xml:id="d319fn3">See <ref target="#d275">Document 275</ref>.</note> There was some
                        uncertainty as to whether he was still referring to two sets of bilateral
                        talks as previously, or whether he was suggesting tri-lateral negotiations.
                        He stated that, if an agreement proved possible between those three
                        countries and there were an end to outside interference and guarantees, then
                        and only then would there be a withdrawal of Soviet forces. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> also commented that large groups
                        of invaders from outside had been eliminated but that there were still small
                        groups which were infiltrating into Afghanistan and committing acts of
                        terrorism.</p>
                    <p>9. Referring to possible <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> initiative on
                        Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said he saw no
                        need for an international conference. He said that if Pakistan was willing
                        to enter into direct negotiations with the Babrak regime, he had the
                        impression—while he could not speak for Afghanistan—that the Afghanis might
                        be prepared to move in the disputed border regions—thus implying a possible
                        Afghanistan willingness to recognize the Durand Line.</p>
                    <p>10. The Secretary made the appropriate responses. He pointed out that, so
                        long as Soviet troops remained in Afghanistan, the situation was not only
                        dangerous for the stability of the region but also contributed to
                        international tensions. It also made ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II more difficult.<note n="4" xml:id="d319fn4">A memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName>, September 26, called two items to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s attention regarding the
                            meeting. <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> was “struck” by
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that
                            “large scale gangs no longer cross the border” in Afghanistan, which
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> took as a sign that
                            the Soviets were “relatively satisfied at the efficacy of the measures
                            they have taken to seal off the Pakistan border and are pleased at the
                            improving security situation in Kabul and other population centers.”
                            Characterizing <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s points
                            as “predictable propaganda,” <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName> also noted the only “modestly new departure” in
                            Soviet policy with respect to Southwest Asia: <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s assertion that “Pakistan
                            should have no apprehensions about Afghanistan territorial claims
                            against them.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Staff

                        believes that the attack of 26 September 1980 by Soviet helicopter gunships
                        against the Pakistan border post in the Mohmand Agency east of the Konar
                        River is a deliberate attempt to intimidate <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> just prior to his departure for the United Nations and

                        Intelligence Directorate commented that the attack might also have been

                        with a <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> correspondent, in which he
                        predicted the Soviets would take advantage of the Iraq-Iran fighting.<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">See Michael T. Kaufman, “Pakistan Predicts Gains

                    <p>2. The Directorate also commented that the Afghan insurgents had achieved a
                        major success a few days ago in an attack on Khandahar airfield, when a
                        dozen Soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground and many Soviets killed.

                        (Headquarters comment: There is no independent evidence that this insurgent
                        attack took place.)</p>
                    <p>3. The wreckage of a helicopter downed during the attack is located only a
                        few hundred yards from the Ghakhai border post (3450N 7117E). It appears
                        that the Soviet helicopters tried to remain on the Afghan side of the border
                        while firing on the border post on the Pakistan side <pb n="858" facs="0903" xml:id="pg_858"/>of the border. (See [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                            intervention. The article also included information from [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] who claimed the attack was
                            undertaken by six Soviet-built MI–24 helicopters, which inflicted
                            “several casualties.” Anti-aircraft fire downed one of the helicopters,
                            which landed in Afghan territory. (Central Intelligence Agency, Office

                            comments from a senior official in Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs casting doubt on the possibility that Afghanistan had a
                            sufficient number of pilots to carry out the attack and indicating that,
                            whether the pilots were Soviet or Afghan, the official had “no doubt”
                            the attack was intentional. (Department of Defense, Afghan War
                            Collection, Box 1, Cross-Border Operations—Pakistan) A report, September
                            29, noted that evidence based on sensitive communications intelligence
                            “strongly suggested” that the attack was undertaken by Soviet pilots.

                    <p>We have an unusual two-tiered relationship with Pakistan—overt and covert. On
                        the overt level, we have a number of differences and Pakistan seeks to keep
                        some distance between us in order to sustain its non-aligned and Islamic
                        credentials. As you know, however, we cooperate closely in a number of
                        covert activities, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] and the
                        program to assist the Afghan insurgents. Pakistan is absolutely key to our
                        ability to keep pressure on the Soviets through the insurgents since it
                        would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to channel arms and
                        supplies through any other route. Without Pakistan’s support, the insurgents
                        probably could not continue for long.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> has been very supportive
                        and personally keeps a close eye on the covert programs through direct
                        supervision of the responsible agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence
                        Directorate (<gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss>). He has also carefully
                        kept the covert program quite separate from most other aspects of our
                        relations, never linking continued covert cooperation to military sales,
                        economic aid, etc. However, some months ago he did choose to use the <gloss target="#t_ISID_1">ISID</gloss> chief as a channel to express his
                        uncertainty about the nature of the American security commitment to

                        reaffirmed his intention to continue cooperation in assisting the

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s invasion of Afghanistan in
                        December 1979 provided a rare opportunity to test the efficacy of the US
                        warning system in situations involving substantial movements of the Soviets’
                        armed forces outside their borders. Moreover, it afforded a chance to
                        examine the behavior of the Soviet military in preparing for such an
                        undertaking and to determine what implications this might have for the
                        Intelligence Community’s capacity to provide warning in other situations,
                        especially one involving a Warsaw Pact move against <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. [<hi rend="italic">classification

                    <p><pb n="862" facs="0907" xml:id="pg_862"/>From the outset, it was recognized
                        that the conclusions of this study could not be pressed too far. Both the
                        performance of the Intelligence Community in providing warning of the
                        invasion of Afghanistan and the applicability to other theaters of the
                        lessons learned in that situation are very much affected by the particular
                        circumstances involved. In contrast to a Soviet move against <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the situation for which the US warning
                        system is largely designed, the invasion of Afghanistan required only a
                        fraction of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s military assets,
                        was not opposed at the outset, did not involve a certainty of confrontation
                        with US forces, and occurred in a region where US intelligence collection
                        capabilities were limited. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>These limitations notwithstanding, the examination of the Soviet approach to
                        invading Afghanistan and the Intelligence Community’s success in giving
                        prior notice of this event have yielded some valuable lessons:</p>
                    <quote><p>—Despite the unique circumstances surrounding this operation, the
                            Soviets’ behavior was essentially in keeping with US estimates of their
                            doctrine for mobilization and the initiation of hostilities. This
                            finding is important because the success of any warning system is
                            dependent on the extent to which an adversary’s behavior conforms to
                            expectations. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                                declassified</hi>])</p>
                        <p>—The system of warning indicators that is set up to detect potentially
                            important changes in the Soviet/Warsaw Pact military posture provided a
                            structured approach to and a sound evidentiary base for the Intelligence
                            Community’s conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            was preparing to introduce substantial forces into Afghanistan. The fact
                            that the system worked in this unique situation provides increased
                            assurance of its usefulness in other theaters, particularly in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> area. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                        <p>—The US intelligence collection system proved equal to the task of
                            providing analysts with sufficiently detailed, accurate, and timely data
                            to allow them to reach essentially correct conclusions about the
                            military activities in the Soviet Union with respect to Afghanistan. Of
                            particular note was the synergy of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                        <p>—The Intelligence Community’s analysts met their basic responsibility in
                            a situation of this sort by providing sufficient prior reporting to
                            assure that no key policymaker should have been surprised by the
                            invasion. The analysts were unable to forecast precisely the timing or
                            the size of the Soviets’ move, but gave warning at least 10 days
                            beforehand that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was prepared

                        intervention in Afghanistan provides a basis for greater confidence in US

                        weapons. Examples of quantities:</p>
                    <quote><p>—10 thousand AK–47 rifles with 13 million rounds of ammunition</p>
                        <p>—720 anti-tank rocket launchers (RPG–7) and 14 thousand rockets</p>
                        <p>—15 thousand land mines</p>
                        <p>—158 Soviet surface-to-air missiles. Initial effort to use weapons in
                            Afghanistan was unsuccessful, probably due to gunner error. Retraining
                            is underway.</p>
                        <p>—200 heavy machine guns and 800,000 rounds of ammunition</p></quote>
                    <p>Most of the equipment is of Soviet origin. There will be no dramatic change
                        in the mix of ordnance in future deliveries, except that consistent with the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> view of Afghanistan as a people’s
                        war (“Give an Afghan a weapon and you have a soldier”), deliveries of .303
                        Enfield rifles will be increased.</p>
                    <p>Reliable intelligence indicates the freedom fighters effective use of the
                        weapons. Soviet helicopters continue to be lost to machine gun ground fire.
                        Armored losses to mine and rocket attacks continue despite Soviet
                        countermeasures. Independent photographic evidence confirms weapon
                        distribution throughout the country. We share <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s satisfaction with the level of the insurgency; it is
                        widespread but of sufficient low intensity not to provoke rash Soviet
                        overreaction.</p>

                            declassified</hi>]) Summary: This report discusses political and
                        military aspects of the Afghan situation as perceived by the Afghan
                        guerrillas. It is divided into six general areas: (A) Soviet
                        pacification/rapproachment efforts, (B) preparations for a protracted
                        conflict, (C) counter-insurgency tactics, (D) feelings toward the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> government, (E) tacit support
                        provided by the Government of Pakistan, and (F) relationships between
                        guerrilla tribes and leaders.</p>
                    <p>8A. (U) Details:</p>
                    <p>(1) ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) Soviet pacification/rapproachment efforts. The
                        guerrillas all expressed a strong hatred for Russians/Soviets. They spoke
                        frequently of Soviet pacification/rapproachment efforts. These efforts have
                        consisted of determined attempts to gain the support of majority
                        sects/tribes while <pb n="865" facs="0910" xml:id="pg_865"/>completely
                        annihilating the smaller minority sects. The guerrillas claim that the
                        Soviets have begun giving aid to the Baluchis who want to achieve
                        independence from Pakistan. As a consequence, the guerrillas have begun to
                        encounter hostility from Baluchi tribes in Afghanistan. The guerrillas
                        believe that the Baluchis are preparing to fight against the guerrillas and
                        feel that the fighting will spread to Baluchistan. The guerrillas point out
                        that with the Baluchis as allies, the Soviets would be able to attain their
                        long sought access to the Indian Ocean through the Arabian Sea. There are
                        also three sects along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border that support the
                        current Afghan Government, i.e., Soviet control (<gloss target="#t_NFI_1">NFI</gloss>). The Soviets are trying to avoid at all costs a united
                        opposition from the entire Afghan population and are using their own ethnic
                        Asian and Arabic minorities as occupation troops in Afghanistan as a means
                        of appeasing the Afghan populace. In spite of Soviet efforts, the guerrillas
                        believe that they can counter pacification/rapproachment activities through
                        high morale and strong anti-Soviet feelings.</p>
                    <p>(2) ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) Preparations for a protracted conflict: The Soviets
                        are preparing for a protracted war by occupying the cities and concentrating
                        their troops there. They have allowed unrestricted movement of people
                        between cities and throughout the rural areas. Neither the Soviets nor the
                        guerrillas attack lines of communication and neither side is seriously
                        disrupting the supply routes of the other. Both sides are currently engaged
                        in harassment tactics while trying to win the support of the populace,
                        particularly the city dwellers. The Soviets do not attack the guerrillas
                        unless the guerrillas engage Soviet forces first. According to the
                        guerrillas, the Soviets are not currently undertaking any large scale
                        offensive actions due to international public opinion. The guerrillas are
                        growing impatient with the lack of Soviet activity, but are resigned to a
                        war of at least ten years duration.</p>
                    <p>(3) ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) Counter-insurgency tactics: The guerrillas claim the
                        Soviets are using napalm, but have little actual knowledge of napalm. They
                        also claim the Soviets are changing troops frequently, replacing
                        “inappropriate” (<gloss target="#t_NFI_1">NFI</gloss>) units with other
                        units. The guerrillas deny that the Soviets have ever used paratroopers in
                        Afghanistan. Although there have not been any major Soviet efforts to search
                        out and destroy the guerrillas, they did attempt to surround the guerrillas
                        in the mountains near Kabul during June of 1980. During this offensive, the
                        Soviet helicopters dropped bombs, booby traps and mines along the
                        guerrillas’ rear supply routes near the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.
                        According to the guerrillas, the approximately 100,000 Soviet troops and
                        less than 30,000 Afghan Government troops are not enough to control all of
                        Afghanistan, and for this reason, the Soviets have seized only the cities
                        and will not attack unless attacked.</p>

                        Feelings toward <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> government:
                        The guerrillas claim they no longer hate <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> and in fact have begun to think favorably of him and
                        sympathize with him. They feel that after he attempted suicide he came to
                        his senses and will no longer execute Afghan citizens as <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName> did.<note n="3" xml:id="d325fn3">The question of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s attempted suicide
                            arose during a Department of State press conference, June 20, and again
                            during a press background briefing conducted on Air Force One, June 25.
                            During both exchanges, a reporter asked if rumors of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s attempted suicide were valid;
                            in both cases the official response was that the United States could not
                            verify the rumor. The Department summarized the first exchange in
                            telegram 162876 to multiple posts, June 20. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D800300–0515) The Embassy summarized the second exchange in telegram
                            9675 from Madrid, June 25. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D800307–0310)</note>
                        The guerrillas predict that the two possible successors to <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> are Asadora Sakuwari (phonetic) of
                        the Haruku (phonetic) sect (correct spelling believed to be “Assadullah
                        Sawari” of the “Khalq” group) or Maamaddo Haan (phonetic) (possibly “Mohamad
                        Han”) of the Uzbeki sect. Either of these two men would be acceptable. The
                        guerrillas feel that the current Afghan administration has adopted the same
                        political policies as the prior administration and that agricultural reform
                        will not be achieved. They feel that the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> administration would resist a U.N. peacekeeping
                        force, attempting to delay it until after guerrilla resistance had
                        collapsed.</p>
                    <p>(5) ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) Tacit support provided by the Government of
                        Pakistan: The refugee/guerrillas are neither encouraged nor seriously
                        discouraged from entering Pakistan by the Pakistani Government. Although
                        Pakistani border patrols have been heavily increased, the refugee/guerrillas
                        cross the border easily. The border near Tor Khan is only lightly guarded by
                        the Pakistani Government and on the Afghan side is guarded by only two
                        soldiers, one of whom is unarmed. Further, the border area in the vicinity
                        of Tor Khan is only delineated by two strands of barbed wire and no
                        fortifications or border patrols are observable. Thus, movement across the
                        border is unimpeded and people and trade goods pass freely. According to the
                        guerrillas, all Afghans become refugees upon entry into Pakistan. They
                        become guerrillas when they return to Afghanistan. When Afghans reach
                        receiving areas in Pakistan, they are processed and then bused to refugee
                        camps. At the refugee camps, they are given four Pakistani rupees and an
                        identification card with their photo on it. The refugees/guerrillas are
                        permitted to move freely in and out of the refugee camps. Some refugee camps
                        are also known as “guerrilla bases”. The term is used interchangeably for at
                        least two “refugee camps” in Pakistan, one at Peshawar and one at Bajaur.
                        Weapons are <pb n="867" facs="0912" xml:id="pg_867"/>not supposed to be
                        carried inside the camps, but instead are supposed to be left at refugee
                        camp headquarters. Nevertheless, arms are carried openly in the camps. Only
                        a few Pakistani officials and no guards are available to staff the camps.
                        The guerrillas are even negotiating to establish a refugee government in
                        Pakistan (<gloss target="#t_NFI_1">NFI</gloss>). There was no evidence of
                        either any other support given to the refugees/guerrillas by the Pakistani
                        Government or of any friction between the Pakistani Government and the
                        refugee/guerrillas.</p>
                    <p>(6) ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                            declassified</hi>]) Relationship between guerrilla tribes and leaders:
                        The traditional fighting between the various Afghan tribes still continues.
                        The guerrillas state that even if the Soviets were to pull out of
                        Afghanistan and another government were established, the fighting would
                        continue between sects/tribes. The guerrillas want to establish their own
                        government. According to the source, the guerrillas do not presently have a
                        leader who can unite the country as the intellectuals are all seeking asylum
                        in Western countries. The guerrillas would only accept a leader who came
                        from a royal family and who has been, and is now, a devout Muslim. People
                        who might meet these requirements are Professor Rabani (phonetic), who is a
                        leader of the Jemiato (phonetic) Islami sect, and Herumacharu (phonetic)
                        (probably Hektyamar), who is a leader of the Hezb-i Islami sect. Both of
                        these men are currently vying for overall leadership.</p>

                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>:</hi>] We share a common concern over the Soviets in
                        Afghanistan. And it is important for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                        to maintain its condemnation. The foregoing, together with the fall of the
                        Shah, has caused us to increase our presence in the region. We now have two
                        carriers in the area. We have pre-positioned military cargo. We are
                        developing the Rapid Deployment Force. We are conducting exercises with some
                        of the countries in the region. We have acquired facilities in Oman and
                        Kenya, and we are determined to keep the Strait of Hormuz open. Moreover, we
                        have recently deployed <gloss target="#t_AWACS_1">AWACS</gloss> to Saudi
                        Arabia. We want to contain the conflict, and we have discouraged the Saudis
                        and Omanis from becoming involved.</p>
                    <p>In my State of the Union message, I stated the region was vital to our
                        national security and that we would act to protect that security. I wanted
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> to know we would feel
                        our vital interests are engaged if there was a Soviet intrusion. They might
                        have moved into Poland if not for the world reaction to their invasion of
                            Afghanistan.<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">The mention of Poland is a
                            reference to the crisis caused by workers’ strikes and the Solidarity
                            trade union movement in September.</note> I see no possibility of
                        business as usual while the Soviets are in Afghanistan. Again, let me say
                        how much we admire your courage as well as your support for the
                        refugees.</p>
                    <p>I am disappointed and regretful that we did not have an adequate
                        communication in the past on an economic/military package.<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3">See <ref target="#d151">Documents 151</ref> and <ref target="#d171">171</ref>.</note> The public/press exchanges were
                        mutually embarrassing. I understand that you do not want military
                        assistance, but we will continue to be helpful in modest ways with regard to
                        the refugees. We also understand your aversion to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military aid, which in any case is forbidden by Con<pb n="869" facs="0914" xml:id="pg_869"/>gress, but we are willing to
                        discuss purchases, if you want, of military equipment. If you need the
                        assurance from us that you could purchase F–16s, we would be forthcoming. I
                        know you have access to French planes, but we are willing to sell if you so
                        desire it. If you want it, let’s work it out between us directly.</p>
                    <p>We are deeply committed to the security of your country. We will be
                        forthcoming if you want to purchase military equipment. We both have
                        military backgrounds, so we can deal, if you want, directly.</p>

                        We admire you personally and we are grateful. We are a developing country
                        and our dream is to have what is best for our military. We have only China,
                        France, or the USA from whom to get aircraft; and only China or the USA for
                        our tanks. We understand your sensitivity about India and we also understand
                        that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must have an interest in

                        the Soviet Union is now our neighbor. I have told the Soviets that we will
                        resist to the end and in the meantime, with your help, we will continue
                        fighting the battle of Pakistan in Afghanistan.</p>

                        I am 100 percent certain the Afghanistanis will not surrender. The Soviets

                        Yes. Not enough has been given so far. I feel that Pakistan should continue
                        to fight in Afghanistan, but Pakistan must be safe. It is in the interest of
                        both Pakistan and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to support the
                        freedom fighters. But Pakistan will be punished by the Soviet Union, and we
                        are prepared for that. If they escalate, and they will do so in the next few
                        months in order to humiliate us, we will stand up and we will need your
                        assistance.</p>

                    <p>(S) While our support for the Afghan insurgency has been far from miniscule,
                        there is reason for concern that the weight of proximate Soviet resources
                        and military strength will gradually weaken the Afghan resistance to the
                        point we will no longer be able to justify our contribution.<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">In response to a query on the strength of the Afghan
                            insurgency, <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Charles Cogan</persName> wrote
                                <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName>, October 14, that
                            the rebels were continuing their activities at a “normal pace.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC_1">Cogan</persName> surmised that the
                            perception of a “faltering insurgency” might be attributable to the fact
                            that “Afghanistan has been pushed off the front pages, primarily by the
                            Iran-Iraq war.” (Central Intelligence Agency, Office of the Director of
                            Central Intelligence, Job 82M00501R: 1980 Subject Files, Box 12, C–367,
                            05 Sep 80–30 Dec 80, Afghanistan) The Iran-Iraq war broke out on
                            September 22 when Iraq attacked across Iran’s western border.</note> Can
                        we figure out ways to keep the Soviets involved and suffering for a longer
                        time? Can we somehow develop the kind of guerrilla capability which could
                        keep the pot boiling at a lower level of intensity? If the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> starts to press Pakistan harder, such a
                        force also could be most useful.</p>
                    <p>(S) To this end, why don’t we begin now to plan for a smaller more
                        professional and better organized cadre of guerrilla forces for long-term
                        operations, as well as for qualitative improvements in the tactics and
                        effectiveness of the present loose-knit insurrection? I suggest we look into
                        the formation of a small trained guerrilla cadre additive to the current
                        guerrilla bands. The latter are probably too ingrained in their tactics and
                        motivated by tribal and personal goals to be easily molded into a more
                        organized force—even if we wanted to. What I have in mind is drawing upon
                        the available manpower to provide the basis for a far more professional
                        guerrilla cadre which could supply small, well trained hit-and-run teams to
                        sustain resistance even if the present loose-knit rebellion gets
                        overwhelmed. Obviously this would have to be done in close cooperation with
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>(S) I recognize there may be serious risks in the proposals
                        above—particularly for a more professional guerrilla force, among other

                        believe we should develop a proposal <pb n="872" facs="0917" xml:id="pg_872"/>along these lines with some urgency. I am prepared to task my staff and
                        the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> to support this planning effort if
                        you agree.<note n="3" xml:id="d327fn3">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_KRW_1">Komer</persName>, November 4, <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> replied that, in the view of
                            the intelligence community, Soviet efforts had not weakened the
                            insurgency; on the contrary, the rebels’ efforts were “alive and well.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CFC_1">Carlucci</persName> agreed with

                    </list>
                    <p>1. At the outset of our program of covert assistance to the Afghan freedom
                        fighters, we judged it best that, to maintain secrecy, we should not involve
                        other Western powers. We were constantly warned by both the Pakistanis and
                        the Saudis that leaks about this assistance were very harmful and could
                        prove fatal to the program. The Pakistan intelligence chief, Gen. Akhtar,
                        said he wanted no other parties involved.</p>
                    <p>2. During the course of discussions with [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] in the first half of 1980, we discussed our Afghan
                        assistance program with them, and they offered to be of help. They assisted
                        in the matter of sending journalists to Pakistan and Afghanistan and, using
                        press outlets, were able significantly to augment, in articles and
                        photographs, <pb n="873" facs="0918" xml:id="pg_873"/>our own efforts to
                        publicize the Afghan resistance. In the matter of arms, we decided to accept
                        their offer of help, provided it was channeled through our own pipeline.
                        These weapons would appear to the Pakistanis to come from us, and we would
                        be adhering to their dictum of not bringing any more parties into the
                        program. In September 1980, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] provided 400,000 rounds of .303 ammunition which was
                        sent in through our supply channels. They are in the process of contributing
                        3,000 Enfield .303 rifles—a weapon with which the Afghan tribesmen are very
                        familiar and which is very popular with them. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>] say they expect to provide at least another
                        5,000 Enfields in the near future. (NOTE: The bulk of our weapons supply has
                        been of Soviet or Bloc manufacture.)</p>
                    <p>3. Also in recent months we have been discussing in general terms with [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] our program of assistance
                        to the Afghan resistance. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] has shown a willingness to help; but because of the
                        Pakistani restrictions, we have limited our response [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. We have told them we would like them
                        to explore means of supplying arms covertly to the Afghan freedom fighters
                        through Iran. In making this recommendation we had two things in mind: a)
                        Pakistani territory would not be used; and b) eventually some of the heat
                        would be taken off the Pakistanis, as the Soviets would realize that arms
                        were coming in not only through Pakistan but also through Iran. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] promised to help
                        and said they would send an officer to survey possible clandestine supply
                        routes and assess the freedom fighters’ needs. We are awaiting the results
                        of this survey.</p>
                    <p>4. All this changed during the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> to Washington, when he told the President he would
                        welcome assistance to the freedom fighters from the West Europeans, and he
                        told the President that he would like <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        help in arranging such assistance.<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2">See <ref target="#d326">Document 326</ref>.</note> While this takes the wraps
                        off the Pakistani restrictions under which we have been operating to date,
                        this Agency must continue to be concerned about the overall security of the
                        weapons supply program to the Afghan insurgents. The Saudis are particularly
                        sensitive about any potential security breaches, and because they are
                        instrumental in providing financing and logistics support, we must continue
                        our efforts to maintain the strict security of the program. Therefore, if
                        there is to be an approach at the policy level [<hi rend="italic">less than
                            1 line not declassified</hi>] about assistance to the Afghan freedom
                        fighters, it would be useful to make a parallel approach [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] so the background to this

                        to Washington can be explained <pb n="874" facs="0919" xml:id="pg_874"/>to

                        would suggest that in the policy-level approach, the sensitivity of this

                            Karmal</persName>’s first official visit to the Soviet Union and the
                        broader issue of the ongoing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. On the eve
                        of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s arrival, in telegram
                        16143 from Moscow, October 15, 1980, the Embassy noted: “the Soviets are not
                        particularly optimistic about their Afghan adventure. They profess to be
                        looking for a political settlement that could lead to a Soviet troop
                        withdrawal and an improvement of relations with the United States. The
                        initiation of talks between Pakistan and the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> government is seen as the first priority in
                        moving toward this political settlement, with the aim of such talks being to
                        halt passage of aid to the insurgents. They are not, however, willing to
                        sacrifice <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> at this point
                        and there is no hint of excessive concern or dismay in the Soviet
                        presentations.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> was in Moscow October 16–17. A

                        consular posts, October 22, the Department commented on <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s visit: “Declaring the Afghan

                        to reaffirm their support for him and for the Afghan peace plan of May 14.
                        Moscow apparently still hopes to see <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>’s hold on power strengthened—and the Parcham-Khalq

                    <p>1. I showed him the Afghan bi-weekly report.<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">The

                            through the covert program); and a campaign in which the Agency
                            manufactured and distributed around the world some 5,000 t-shirts
                            bearing messages of support for the Afghan insurgency. The report
                            described this campaign as having a “remarkable impact.” Also included
                            was a list containing the most recent data on weapons delivered or
                            awaiting shipment to the insurgents, totaling over [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]. The weapons awaiting shipment
                            represented approximately one-third of the total cost. The bi-weekly

                        that he doesn’t think we are providing enough arms to the insurgents and
                        wants us to increase it. As you know, I sympathize with this point of view.
                        I am not sure an increase from [<hi rend="italic">amount not

                        think it was incisive enough to make a real impact on him. In short, he felt
                        that it was obvious the Arabs would be upset and he wondered if we had
                        anything more to say. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and

                            activity in every province of Afghanistan, urban security is worse, and
                            much of the countryside is under insurgent control. The Soviets have
                            been adapting their force structure and tactics to this situation,
                            however, and gradually are becoming more effective.</hi> ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have prevented the insurgents from seizing a provincial capital
                        or any other symbolic target and may believe they are making a start on a
                        long process of establishing a durable Communist Afghan regime. They
                        probably believe that the diplomatic costs will continue <pb n="877" facs="0922" xml:id="pg_877"/>to decrease as the world loses interest and
                        comes to accept their occupation of Afghanistan. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] estimates that between
                        20,000 and 50,000 insurgents are in the field at any one time, in groups
                        ranging from 25 to 2,000. This force is drawn from possibly as many as 1
                        million Afghans involved intermittently in the fighting. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling restriction not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the insurgents are
                        in “full control” of about half the districts in the country and control
                        another quarter at night. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                            declassified</hi>] seem to support this. Until recently, insurgents had
                        been in virtual control of parts of the city of Herat, and assassinations
                        and sabotage occur frequently in Kabul and other cities. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Attacks on roads and government installations are common even in districts
                        supposedly under full government control. Insurgent raids on convoys have
                        almost completely disrupted the country’s transport system; many civilian
                        truck drivers refuse to travel in the countryside even with a military
                        escort. The Soviets recently forbade military convoys to move after dark and
                        adopted new procedures in an attempt to improve their air support for the
                        convoys. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking, codeword, and handling

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Mixed Results for Moscow</p>
                    <p>The Soviet presence and firepower have forced the insurgents to forgo
                        large-scale operations. Before the invasion, the insurgents moved at will in
                        sizable groups, but now they retreat quickly to avoid Soviet forces. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                        declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The insurgents, moreover, no longer attempt to sustain siege operations
                        against important government garrisons and towns, to block roads
                        permanently, or to hold any area Soviet troops make a serious effort to
                        clear. As recent operations in the northeast and Konar Valley indicate,
                        however, the Soviets do not have nearly enough troops to garrison the
                        country and still cannot depend on the Afghan Army to do the job for them.
                            ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The insurgents are still able to move men and material across the border with
                        Pakistan and Iran despite Soviet efforts to reduce the flow. Soviet patrols,
                        sweep operations, and extensive mining so far have been directed at only
                        part of the border. The Soviets have only succeeded in turning open borders
                        into borders that must be crossed with more caution. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>There has been only slight success in winning over insurgents, but there have
                        been some defections to the government; a few important arms caches have
                        been seized, presumably on information from defectors and prisoners. Such
                        inroads are insignificant and seem to have <pb n="878" facs="0923" xml:id="pg_878"/>had no impact on the level of resistance in any part of
                        the countryside. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking and codeword not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Fear of Soviet reprisals has made some Afghans reluctant to shelter
                        insurgents, but this has been a problem only for the few bands that operate
                        outside their home areas, particularly some based in Pakistan. Most Afghan
                        villagers still support the locally based insurgents who make up the bulk of
                        the resistance. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have helped give the Babrak government time to try to consolidate
                        politically. The insurgents cannot bring down the government by military
                        means, and they recognize that it will be a long war. Although some exile
                        groups seeking outside support have claimed that insurgent morale is
                        declining, there are no signs that this is the case. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Over the next year or so, some tribesmen probably will begin to lose
                        confidence that they can overthrow the Babrak government. Although many
                        others will continue fighting, the level of insurgency nevertheless may
                        gradually begin to decrease. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>The erosion of tribal determination would be abetted if Kabul were to appear
                        to be avoiding radical social changes and were seen as trying to exercise
                        only nominal authority in the countryside, in the manner of traditional
                        Afghan governments. The government’s identification with the Soviets,
                        however, makes its prospects for winning the acceptance of the Afghan
                        peoples extremely remote. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not
                            declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>If Pakistan continues to provide aid and a safehaven, the insurgency will
                        continue at a level that will require the Soviets to keep a large military
                        force in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future. The survival of the Babrak
                        government could depend on the presence of at least some Soviet combat
                        forces for years. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not

                        Afghanistan without disrupting military deployments elsewhere or

                    <quote><p><pb n="880" facs="0925" xml:id="pg_880"/>—The Kabul government does
                            not control the provinces.</p>
                        <p>—The Afghan Army continues to deteriorate. Conscription schemes and local
                            defense plans have failed.</p>
                        <p>—Soviet equipment and personnel losses have been relatively heavy,
                            considering the poorly equipped and unorganized state of the
                            resistance.</p>
                        <p>—Roads and cities are still vulnerable to attack, and logistical supply
                            is still a major problem.</p></quote>
                    <p>The Soviets, however, have chosen not to increase the size of their force.
                        Rather, they are adopting new tactics built around more mobile ground forces
                        and the heavy use of helicopter and aircraft strikes. The country has been
                        divided into eight zones of responsibility, each with a senior commander and
                        a combination of airborne, infantry, artillery, and air support.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the Soviets are building housing, stronger defense positions,
                        and permanent logistic and support bases. During <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName>’s recent visit to Moscow, the Soviets pledged
                        continued military support.<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">See <ref target="#d320">Document 320</ref>.</note> The joint statement issued
                        at the end of the visit reaffirmed that Moscow would not discuss the
                        question of Soviet withdrawals until 1) hostilities had ceased and 2)
                        guarantees that they would not resume were in place.</p>
                    <p>We conclude, therefore, that the Soviet military intends to support the
                        Marxist regime and pursue the suppression of the resistance for an extended
                        period of time. Recent Soviet emphasis on the time when the situation in
                        Afghanistan returns to “normal” suggests that, for the moment at least,
                        Moscow is not planning any major increase in its force in Afghanistan. At
                        some point, however, perhaps next year, they may decide to increase the size
                        of their force or mount a more aggressive campaign to seal the borders with
                        Iran and Pakistan. We also do not rule out another cosmetic withdrawal for
                        propaganda purposes.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Domestic Scene</p>
                    <p>Since the coup in April 1978 that toppled Daoud, the Soviets have advised
                        Kabul to build up its political base and infrastructure. <persName corresp="#p_TNM_1">Taraki</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName>’s failures or inability to implement this advice were
                        largely responsible for the increase in the Soviet military presence and,
                        ultimately, for the invasion last December. Over the last eight months,
                        numerous <gloss target="#t_CPSU_1">CPSU</gloss>, Komsomol, and government
                        delegations have visited Afghanistan to help train their Afghan counterparts
                        at the provisional and national level in party and government work. During
                        the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> visit, the Soviets again
                        emphasized the need to broaden the Afghan communist party’s base.</p>
                    <p><pb n="881" facs="0926" xml:id="pg_881"/>The effectiveness of the Soviet
                        effort has been hampered by the continued insurgency and by the
                        Khalq-Parcham feud. Nevertheless, the Soviets have expressed satisfaction
                        with their progress. Whether they can or cannot eventually shift the
                        struggle from the military to the political level, they seem reconciled to a
                        protracted presence in Afghanistan. In time, Afghan institutions will be
                        forced into a Soviet mold.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Diplomacy</p>
                    <p>Moscow’s refusal to enter into a dialogue on a political settlement and its
                        continued adherence to the Afghan peace plan of May 14 probably reflect its
                        assessment that its diplomatic approach is gradually succeeding. Poland and
                        the Iraq-Iran conflict have pushed Afghanistan off the front pages, and the
                        Islamic Conference’s initiative has faltered with <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName>’s removal and Tehran’s
                        preoccupations with the war with Iraq.<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">Iranian
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GS_1">Ghotbzadeh</persName> was
                            removed in August.</note></p>
                    <p>As <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> noted in his speech
                        welcoming <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> to Moscow, Pakistan
                        remains the key to Soviet efforts in Afghanistan. The Soviets, therefore,
                        will keep the pressure on Islamabad to stop supporting the resistance. The
                        recent Soviet attacks on Pakistani border garrisons, as well as reports of
                        Soviet contacts with Baluchs and members of the Pakistani opposition,
                        probably are meant as warnings to the <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> regime that Soviet tolerance is limited. Thus, we do not
                        rule out selected Soviet or Afghan military attacks against bases in
                        Pakistan. The Soviets, however, probably would be reluctant at this point to
                        see the conflict expand beyond Afghanistan’s borders for fear of
                        regalvanizing Islamic reaction and alienating India.</p>

                    <p>1. (C—Entire text.)</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: The skies above Kabul have again been filled with helicopters and
                        other aircraft for the past few days as Soviet and Afghan forces launched
                        offensives against Mujaheddin in several parts of the country. Some of this
                        activity within 80 kilometers of Kabul has been billed by the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> as Afghan military maneuvers, but
                        travelers report that it is no exercise. The Shia day of deep mourning
                        passed in Kabul without major incident but the week witnessed several
                        violent incidents in and around the city, including the killing of an Afghan
                        family by marauding Soviet troops. Bus drivers on the route north of
                        Mazar-i-Sharif went on strike to protest the shooting of one of their number
                        by Soviet troops last week, and there have been attacks on convoys along
                        other major highways. Fragmentary reports from Herat and Kandahar indicate
                        that a Soviet offensive is also underway in those large cities, where some
                        knowledgeable diplomats claim Cuban troops are stationed. The regime has
                        dispatched party volunteers to mine coal and collect firewood for delivery
                        to Kabul for the approaching winter. The party held its fourth plenum on
                        November 11, followed by a series of rather hysterical meetings urging
                        support for the regime. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> propaganda
                        mill has stepped up its activities, especially against the US, China and
                        Pakistan, often using slanted or false material. Low-level harassment of
                        Mission personnel continues, and we still find it difficult to obtain visas
                        for new arrivals. End summary.</p>
                    <p>New Soviet offensive</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviets may have shifted their tactics in trying to crush the
                        ubiquitous but elusive Mujaheddin. On November 15 the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> Ministry of National Defense announced
                        joint ground and air maneuvers in Kabul, Parwan, Ghazni and Nangrahar
                        Provinces beginning the next day. Dozens of Soviet helicopters took to the
                        air heading in those <pb n="884" facs="0929" xml:id="pg_884"/>directions on
                        November 16. That activity continues as this is being drafted and a few
                        high-flying jet fighters and bombers have also been sighted over Kabul.
                        Soviet air transport flights also seem to have increased markedly during
                        this period, but large road convoys have not been observed as often as about
                        a week ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d334fn3"> [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>] Soviet military leaders in Afghanistan had
                            recently concluded that the “situation in Afghanistan is currently a
                            stalemate.” Despite recognizing that “most” of the country was
                            controlled by insurgents, the Soviets believed the rebels could be
                            defeated eventually. Among the tactics authorized toward that end, the
                            report noted, was an increased use of helicopters. (Carter Library,

                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> announcement noted that the
                        forces slated for the maneuvers had already left for the listed areas, and
                        our sources confirmed that large military contingents had arrived in several
                        locations by November 15. Two of them said that one contingent had also
                        moved into Wardak Province, though that was not one of the sites specified
                        for the maneuvers. All of these sources reported that the military forces
                        were conducting searches of villages for Mujaheddin and potential
                        conscripts. In at least one case (in Wardak) Soviet forces were shelling a
                        suspected Mujaheddin encampment. Another generally reliable source informed
                        us November 18 that Soviet forces trying for the fourth time to invade the
                        Panjshir Valley had met with the usual stiff resistance for the fourth day
                        in a row.</p>
                    <p>5. Kabul itself has been slightly more tense since the beginning of the Shia
                        religious mourning month of Muharram on November 8. However, the 10th of
                        Muharram (November 17), a day usually marked by processions of
                        self-flagellating Shias, passed without major incident in the city. The Shia
                        processions were unusually small and none was addressed by leading <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> figures, as had been the practice in
                        pre-leftist days. Justice Minister Aryan was sent to observe one procession.
                        While he made no speech himself, he ordered attending preachers to include
                        blessings for the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> in their prayers,
                        after which many participants were heard to grumble loudly about “godless
                        Communists.”</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I wish to thank you for all your past help to the Afghan people and Afghan
                        refugees. The people of Afghanistan shall, with due respect, remember all
                        the contributions which the friendly nations have made during this trying
                        period in our history.</p>
                    <p>It is the graveness of the existing situation facing the Afghan people
                        however, which prompts me to make an urgent appeal for further humanitarian
                        assistance to merely enable us to provide the basic means of survival for a
                        people subjected to the most unprecedented genocide of our time.</p>
                    <p>While the heroic struggle of Afghan people is not only for their own survival
                        but also for the sake of humanity and in defence of basic human principles
                        and human rights, one can not help but to note that this defenceless Nation
                        is patiently and perseveringly facing the cruel and indiscriminate shellings
                        and bombardments of their towns, villages and even large cities and
                        population centers paralleled with lootings, burnings, executions, tortures
                        and various other unhuman atrocities. The Russian military units, these
                        byproducts of atheism and communism, completely devoid of human dignity and
                        even self respect commit all these crimes in cold blood.</p>
                    <p>All this, in the course of the Russian aggression in Afghanistan, has left
                        hundreds of thousands who are wounded, millions who are facing starvation,
                        an equal number lacking shelter in the face of the cold season and almost
                        the entire population devoid of medical care, even to a modest standard.
                        Next to these are near a million and half people who have been forced to
                        cross over the borders, mostly to Pakistan, among whom are many weak, ill
                        and wounded people.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the extent of existing need for food, medicine and shelter
                        requires a facility which is completely beyond the material and financial
                        possibilities of our organization, and thus we find it necessary to call for
                        help.</p>
                    <p>Any further assistance you can offer at this time will be deeply appreciated
                        by me and the freedom fighters as well as by all Afghan people.</p>

                        1981 Afghanistan Covert Action Program of $60 million,<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">Attached but not printed. In the October 27 memorandum

                            authorized in July 1980; and that the total of $60 million would be
                            split evenly between the United States and Saudi Arabia. If other
                            countries elected to contribute funds to aid the Afghan insurgents,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> directed that the

                            requesting the funding increase was not found. In a memorandum for the

                            that <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> signed a

                        and Pakistani allies, that the program justifies a higher level of support.
                        Per our earlier conversations, I believe we should increase the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1981 total to $80 million.<note n="3" xml:id="d336fn3">In a November 26 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName>, attached but not printed,

                        was informed by General Akhtar, head of the Pakistani intelligence service,
                        that the Pakistanis were now in a position to distribute into Afghanistan as

                        appropriately larger purchases and expansion of the existing logistics

                        Of this total, $60 million was previously authorized as a consequence of the

                        David’s memo of 27 October ($40 million). Thus this memo specifically

                    <p>Dear Kurt:</p>
                    <p>I know from our previous talks that you join with me in welcoming the action
                        by the General Assembly in adopting by an overwhelming majority a resolution
                        calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. This strong
                        expression of support for international law and the United Nations Charter
                        by the General Assembly has made a very favorable impact on the American
                        people and has reinforced their faith in the moral authority of the United

                    <p><pb n="889" facs="0934" xml:id="pg_889"/>In the resolution, as you know, the
                        Assembly expressed its hope that you would appoint a special representative
                        to seek a political solution on the basis of the resolution and in
                        accordance with its call for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> has already expressed
                        our strong views to you in this regard, but I want you to know that this is
                        a matter of personal concern to me.</p>
                    <p>In light of the Soviet attitude I recognize that it will not be easy to move
                        rapidly toward a political solution based on the withdrawal of Soviet
                        troops. But I trust you will agree that the appointment of your special
                        representative should be expedited because of the overwhelming vote by the
                        international community. The 111 member states who supported the resolution
                        were well aware of the Soviet Union’s negative attitude. Nevertheless, we
                        expressed support for your appointment of a special representative to
                        promote a solution based on the principles of the Charter which the Soviet
                        Union has so flagrantly violated in Afghanistan.</p>

                        Relations.</p>
                    <p>1. (S) Entire text.</p>
                    <p>2. Summary: The end of 1980 and the current transition period leads us to
                        take another look at some fundamental issues which are key to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>/Pakistan relations during the coming
                        years. For simplicity of presentation we have divided these concerns into
                        (A) Afghanistan-related issues, (B) <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>/Pakistan bilateral issues and expectations, and (C) South and
                        Southwest Asia security concerns. This telegram, addressing the Afghanistan
                        question, is the first of three which we are submitting and which are
                        intended to stimulate a dialogue with Washington and other concerned posts
                        aimed at a more precise definition of options available to us. The
                        Afghanistan situation remains central to our relationship with Islamabad and
                        to Islamabad’s relationship with many of the nations of Southwest, if not
                        South, Asia. Pakistan’s firm stance on Afghanistan continues to be
                        fundamental to our own policy. We think it behooves us to take a look
                        ahead—possibly at some unthinkables—so that our policies will at least
                        attempt to influence the course of events rather than the other way around.
                        End summary.</p>
                    <p>3. In the midst of a major transition between administrations and as we near
                        the first anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, we think it
                        opportune to suggest that the Department and other members of the foreign
                        affairs community in Washington take a look at the Afghan situation and the
                        policy options it presents us. Some of those options bear directly on the
                        future of our relationship with Pakistan and other countries in this region,
                        and we would like to offer a few thoughts from this vantage point.</p>
                    <p>4. We start with a few basic assumptions derived from our reading of the
                        current situation in Afghanistan and the likely course of events over the
                        next year; these we regard as “givens”:</p>
                    <p>—(A) Soviet troops will remain in Afghanistan as long as Moscow deems it
                        necessary to secure a sympathetic regime in Kabul and to remold Afghan
                        institutions along Communist lines;</p>
                    <p>—(B) Soviet pressures, including cross-border attacks on Pakistan, will
                        continue and probably escalate as Moscow seeks to intimidate <pb n="891" facs="0936" xml:id="pg_891"/>the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> to
                        drop its opposition to Soviet policy and to accept the “irreversibility” of
                        events in Afghanistan;</p>
                    <p>—(C) Large numbers of Afghan refugees (which could approach two million) will
                        remain in Pakistan for the foreseeable future becoming an increasingly
                        serious domestic political issue in Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier
                        particularly, and</p>
                    <p>—(D) The Afghan resistance will continue to obstruct Soviet efforts to pacify
                        the Afghan countryside, but at present levels of outside support it may
                        begin to lose effectiveness as the war of attrition drags on in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>5. There may be some debate among Americans about the validity or force of
                        these assumptions, but there is substantial evidence that they form the
                        current mind-set of most key Pakistanis who will be responsible for
                        influencing Pakistan’s own policy toward Afghanistan. For the Pakistanis,
                        therefore, these are very real factors which we must take into account in
                        determining our own approach to the issues involved, including the nature of
                        our bilateral relationship with Islamabad.</p>
                    <p>6. We would hope that someone in transition Washington is looking down the
                        road six months or a year trying to ascertain where would we prefer to be
                        then.</p>
                    <p>—Are we prepared, for example, to simply let the situation drift, somehow
                        hoping that the resistance will remain strong and that Pakistan will
                        maintain a firm stance against the Soviets?</p>
                    <p>—Or are we prepared to take some positive initiatives either to help defuse
                        the tensions boiling in the area or to bolster Pakistani resolve in standing
                        up in the face of intense pressures?</p>
                    <p>These are difficult questions to which we do not have the answers. We suggest
                        only that someone should be giving them serious thought.</p>
                    <p>7. If we assume that the Soviets will negotiate over Afghanistan only on
                        their own terms (essentially the May 14 proposals), we do not see much
                        likelihood of a solution which would meet our stated requirements including
                        complete Soviet troop withdrawal, restoration of Afghanistan’s nonaligned
                        and independent status, self-determination for the Afghan people, and
                        guarantees of keeping up our own firm opposition to the invasion and
                        recognition of the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> regime. On
                        the other hand, we ourselves may have extended an aspect of formal
                        recognition to <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName> by granting an
                        A–1 visa to one of his diplomats.<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">Telegram

                            conduct official business on behalf of their government.</note> Is it
                        not at least conceivable that Pakistan could find a way <pb n="892" facs="0937" xml:id="pg_892"/>of talking to Babrak while obscuring the
                        fact of recognition. If this were to reduce tensions in the region, would we
                        see such a development as in our interest or not?</p>
                    <p>8. If we think it very important to avoid such a development, then we should
                        be taking concrete steps to bolster Pakistan in ways which the Pakistanis
                        consider meaningful. With the exception of debt relief, we have so far been
                        unable to deliver on our rhetoric of support for Pakistan. We have in fact
                        cheered on from a comfortable distance while the Pakistanis themselves bear
                        the real costs of standing up to the Soviets. True, we have provided
                        generous humanitarian assistance to the Afghan refugees but that is not
                        likely to count for very much among Pakistani decision-makers who may
                        believe they are faced with their country’s very survival.</p>
                    <p>9. We realize that any discussion of support for Pakistan on a scale which
                        would produce measurable results here automatically raises the prospect of
                        strong Indian reactions. But we must question how much good will we have won
                        in India by our recent policies of providing almost nothing (in relative
                        terms) to Pakistan. We suggest there is a middle ground between minimal
                        support and maximal support for Pakistan which would solidify our position
                        and strengthen Pakistan. Naturally, whatever we do will have an impact on
                        relations with New Delhi, but thirty years of threading policy course among
                        the irrelevant (to us) enmities of the region should long ago have
                        accustomed us to the fact that we cannot satisfy ourselves and everyone else
                        in South Asia at the same time.</p>
                    <p>10. Another set of issues revolves around the question of military assistance
                        to the Afghan resistance groups. The problems in providing such aid,
                        including the multitude of competing groups and the desirability of
                        maintaining a diplomatic mission in Kabul, have been discussed before in
                        other forums. We would submit, however, that we cannot realistically expect
                        the Mujahideen to go on fighting the Russians forever without increased
                        support and we should be thinking how we would adjust our policy to deal
                        with such a development.<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">It is not clear if
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAW_1">Hummel</persName> was aware of the
                            recently authorized increase in expenditures to support the Afghan
                            insurgency; or if he was, whether he viewed such incremental steps as
                            sufficient.</note> Or we should take another hard look at what we can do
                        to sustain and promote the resistance cause.</p>
                    <p>11. Finally, we need to do some serious long-range planning on our role in
                        providing relief to growing numbers of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Not only
                        should we be taking steps to ensure adequate funds are available for a
                        generous contribution of our own over the <pb n="893" facs="0938" xml:id="pg_893"/>next several years, but we should carefully consider
                        supporting recent <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> interest in an
                        international pledging conference. Such a conference could serve two of our
                        stated objectives, namely to stimulate other potential donors to take on a
                        greater share of the relief burden as well as to focus additional
                        international attention on the Afghan situation. Strong and prompt support
                        for this <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> suggestion would be
                        well-received in Islamabad.</p>
                    <p>12. We need to look as well at our own immigration policy regarding the flood
                        of Afghans with whom our consular officers are currently besieged, with a
                        view toward making additional numbers available for Afghan
                        applicants—perhaps by designating them a separate refugee category—and
                        expediting application procedures to the extent possible. We have already
                        suggested, for example, that a voluntary agency rep be assigned to concerned
                        posts to help with processing (Islamabad 12007 and 12444).<note n="4" xml:id="d338fn4">Telegram 12007 from Islamabad is dated November 11;

                    <p>13. In sum, we should look ahead to the likely ramifications of possible
                        Afghan developments which we would view as adverse to our regional
                        interests, i.e., Soviet consolidation of its position in Afghanistan,
                        collapse of the Afghan resistance, Pakistani acceptance of a fait accompli
                        across the Durand Line, and possible Pakistani accommodation to broader
                        Soviet aims in the region. If we conclude that we can live in such a new
                        environment, then certain policy options offer themselves as preferable. If
                        otherwise, then other steps would seem called for.</p>
                    <p>14. We hope the Department agrees that such a look ahead would be both timely
                        and useful. We would be happy to contribute to the discussion in any way

                        Arms for Mujahideen.</p>
                    <p>When I saw Egyptian <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> Scharaff Dec 10 for
                        a return courtesy call, I raised subject of foreign inputs to Afghan
                        Mujahideen, asking what he knew of the matter. First elliptically, and then
                        more directly, he acknowledged that he knew of Egypt’s own assistance and
                        also something of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and Saudi activities.
                        He did not talk about the content or magnitude of the inputs.</p>
                    <p>He said that in his Mission only he and his MilAtt (whom Scharaff personally
                        chose, the MilAtt having been a lieutenant under Scharaff in the army) knew
                        of the inputs. The MilAtt deals directly with Gen Akhtar on these matters.
                        Scharaff had a favorable impression of Gen Akhtar. I said on my side only a
                        very few of my officers knew of the program not including my military
                        attachés. I said that the Egyptian <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                        (Scharaff said this officer was also one of his own choosing “because
                        personal loyalty is very important”) had been discussing with foreign
                        diplomats the subject of arms to Mujahideen. I said I proposed that in our
                        Embassy only the <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> and I should have such
                        discussions. Scharaff agreed, and indicated he would pass the word for those
                        not witting on his staff (he said that “some of them may have a general
                        idea”) not to ask questions or discuss the subject. Comment: My purpose in
                        raising the subject was to make Scharaff aware that his <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> has been making statements about arms
                        input and probing for information).</p>
                    <p>He asked how the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Embassy deals with this
                        subject with the Pakistanis. I said I have an “Intelligence Liaison Officer”
                        (whom I did not name) who deals only with Gen Akhtar.</p>
                    <p>We both agreed that the <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> should not be
                        involved in this subject. I told him that I had had clear instructions from
                        Pres <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> not to discuss it with the
                            <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>.</p>

                        an intelligence officer assigned to his staff, and that after that officer
                        arrived he hoped he and my officer could be in touch. I was
                        noncommittal.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> Xu Yi-xin I tried to probe him on

                        acknowledged that the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> would like to see
                        more support given to the freedom fighters, but asserted that <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> support goes to the <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>

                        officer who arrived in Peshawar in early December 1980, and who until late
                        November was an active member of the Iranian-based Afghan dissident
                        organization, the United Islamic Alliance (<gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss>) (Shura-i-Etefaq), during mid-November the Iranian
                        Government supplied a sizeable shipment of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> manufactured weapons to <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> insurgents in Ghazni Province. The <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> is an alliance of Afghan Shia groups dominated by Hazaras
                        from central and southern Afghanistan. The leader of the <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> is Asif Mohsani, a Shia from Qandahar, who
                        now resides in and leads the <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> from Qum,
                        Iran. The <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> does not maintain a presence
                        in Pakistan. (Source comment: The officer said he had been told by other
                            <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> members that because of Mohsani’s
                        fundamentalist Shia orientation, he has good relations with and the support
                        of <persName corresp="#p_KAR_1">Ayatollah Khomeini</persName>. Because of
                        this close relationship, Mohsani is the only Afghan dissident leader known
                        to be residing in Qum. In the officer’s opinion, no other Afghan dissident
                        group is currently receiving weapons support from the Iranians.)</p>
                    <p>2. The officer stated that during mid-November the <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss> headquarters in Ghazni Province, located at Jaghori
                        (approximate coordinates 33’ 10N 57’ 30E), received from Iran a shipment of
                        1,000 M–1 Garand rifles, a quantity of ammunition, grenade projection
                        adapters for the M–1s with a quantity of both anti-tank and anti-personnel
                        grenades, and a quantity of unidentified <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-manufactured anti-tank rocket launchers and anti-tank
                        mines. (Source comment: Other than the number of M–1s in the shipment, the
                        officer did not specify the quantities of other weapons and ammunition
                        received by the <gloss target="#t_UIA_1">UIA</gloss>. The officer also
                        commented that this was the only shipment of Iranian supplied weapons and

                        received from Kabul during the first week of December 1980, Soviet imposed
                        Afghan leader ((Babrak)) was showing strong signs of nervousness.
                        Eyewitnesses reported that he chain smoked, appeared generally ill at ease
                        and upon slightest provocation broke into cursing, unusual for a man known
                        for his gentle language.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">According to an

                        the day, government police were on the streets of Kabul, but during the
                        night rebels roamed the city in small groups distributing leaflets and
                        calling on merchants to dictate price ceilings on still available goods.
                        Soviet soldiers broke into two of the main stores in Kabul during the night
                        and completely cleaned out the Afghan department store and the agency for

                        candidates considered by the Soviets for the replacement of Babrak. One of
                        them was ((Sarvari)), former Chief of Intelligence, who after the Soviet
                        invasion became deputy to Babrak. He was said to have subsequently left for

                        Under the royal regime in Afghanistan, he held an important post in the
                        Ministry of Planning. He was then named Minister of Commerce after gaining
                        the confidence of President Daoud, who allowed him to participate in all

                    <p>In the year since their Christmas Eve invasion, the Soviets have achieved

                        limited progress toward establishing conditions that will permit the Babrak

                    <p>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the US response to it produced a sharp
                        reaction in China that led Beijing to squelch domestic debate over foreign
                        policy, reduce its meager relations with Moscow, and expand contacts with

                    <p>China’s decision in January 1980 to suspend the resumption of political

                        slated for this spring ended the latest phase in bilateral relations that
                        began after China’s denunciation of the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty in April
                        1979. During that period, political fluidity in China and heightened
                        tensions resulting from China’s invasion of Vietnam created a situation in
                        which dissonant voices called for a lessening of China’s hostility toward
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and an increase in bilateral

                        temporary alliance with party leftists during the spring of 1979, when

                        relationship outweigh the costs of continuing hostility toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He also has appeared anxious to prove
                        the value of the US connection at times when Washington seemed to be
                        improving relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or when
                        Taiwan-related issues have emerged—developments that strengthen critics of
                            <persName corresp="#p_DXH_1">Deng</persName>’s foreign policy. Some
                        Chinese, moreover, may calculate that Washington’s concern about possible
                        improvements in Sino-Soviet relations can be manipulated to induce the
                        United States to provide China with technology, equipment, and political
                        support to forestall a Chinese move toward accommodation with the Soviets.

                    <p>Sino-Soviet relations since Afghanistan have worsened despite Soviet efforts
                        to portray progress. Beijing remains eager to rally opposition to Soviet
                        “hegemonism,” to explore sales of US civilian and military technology, and
                        to portray the Chinese leadership as unified as it goes through the
                        transition from older to younger leaders. ([<hi rend="italic">classification
                            marking not declassified</hi>])</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, Beijing has maintained minimal, correct diplomatic dealings with
                        Moscow, and has reserved the option to reopen political negotiations. The
                        chances that Beijing would exercise that option would increase from the
                        current low if political turmoil arises in China as it did in April 1979, or
                        if <persName corresp="#p_DXH_1">Deng</persName> has to placate elements in
                        the Chinese leadership who are skeptical of the US relationship.
                        Circumstances that <pb n="903" facs="0948" xml:id="pg_903"/>might put
                        pressure on <persName corresp="#p_DXH_1">Deng</persName> to make such a move
                        could include a return to detente politics in the West or a developing trend
                        toward “official” ties between Washington and Taipei. ([<hi rend="italic">classification marking not declassified</hi>])</p>

                            Soviet support, Pakistan and Afghanistan had tentatively agreed to begin
                            talks. (Michael T. Kaufman, “Afghanistan and Pakistan Report Progress

                        Afghanistan, I was informed by President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and Acting Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> that Soviet Ambassador has suddenly pulled the rug
                        out from under them by informing <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> that
                        regional conference on Afghanistan would not be possible if linked to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly resolution, that
                        participation of Iran was not acceptable, and that <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>

                            10, the Embassy reported that officials in Pakistan’s Embassy in the
                            Soviet Union privately considered the Soviet move as evidence that its
                            pressure on Pakistan had “borne fruit.” Additionally, the telegram noted
                            “intense pressure” placed upon Pakistan by the Soviet Union to enter
                            into talks with the <gloss target="#t_DRA_1">DRA</gloss> on the latter’s
                            terms; if Pakistan did not, the Soviets “hinted” of “possible Soviet
                            action ahead,” presumably a veiled threat of a military attack.
                            According to a Pakistani Embassy official, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> took this threat seriously in light of what he
                            considered insufficient support either from Western Europe or the United
                            States. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                        summary.</p>
                    <p>3. I called on President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> at noon
                        today, accompanied by <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>, to carry out
                        instructions contained in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, who leaves for Gulf and
                        Turkey early tomorrow morning, had Acting Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> and Americas Director Rana
                        present.</p>
                    <p>4. I went through talking points contained in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> word for word with President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, emphasizing certain points and adding thought that
                        softening of Islamic Conference resolution would be premature. I expanded on
                        talking point regarding Jan 7 Radio Moscow commentary and left <gloss target="#t_FBIS_1">FBIS</gloss> transcript of commentary with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. I also left text of Department Press
                        Spokesman’s Jan 7 briefing dealing with Afghanistan initiative, and in this
                        connection I made point that we were taking positive position in public
                        while expressing our concerns over this initiative to <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> in private.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> responded by briefly rehearsing
                        how <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> had arrived at present position.
                        Islamic Conference Standing Committee, expanded to include Guinea and
                        Tunisia, had led to nowhere and Pakistan had quite deliberately moved
                        situation towards <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly vote
                        that had resulted in overwhelming call for Soviet withdrawal. Recent
                        initiative entirely that of Soviet Union and he could see three possible
                        motives for new Soviet initiative:</p>
                    <p>—A. Buying time. Soviet initiative—“if indeed it is an initiative”—might be
                        nothing more than a “short-sighted” maneuver to get them past the Islamic
                        Summit and <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> gathering.<note n="5" xml:id="d345fn5">Reference is to the upcoming Islamic Summit in Saudi
                            Arabia January 25–28 and the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the
                            Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi February 9–12.</note> Similar tactics
                        were employed by Soviets before two Islamic Foreign Ministers’
                        Conferences.</p>
                    <p>—B. Beset with difficulties in Kampuchea, Poland and Afghanistan, Soviets
                        decided it was to their advantage to show signs of flexibility in at least
                        one of these places.</p>
                    <p>—C. Other explanation was the Mujahidin resistance was becoming so costly
                        that Soviets had decided that it was to their advantage to try <pb n="905" facs="0950" xml:id="pg_905"/>and reach an understanding with Pakistan,
                        the only country in a position to inhibit activities of freedom
                        fighters.</p>
                    <p>6. Now, however, said <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, there had
                        been a new development of which he had not himself yet been fully briefed,
                        and he would let Acting Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> explain what had happened. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> prefaced his remarks by saying
                        that new Soviet Ambassador Smirnov and aide who accompanied him both spoke
                        excellent English and there could be no question of misunderstanding, as had
                        occasionally happened with previous Soviet Ambassador. Original approach to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> had led to meeting at
                        which Soviet Ambassador made his pitch to <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>. In course of outlining
                        his proposal for a regional conference Ambassador Smirnov had at least three
                        times made following statements in reply to questions put to him by <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss> side.</p>
                    <p>—A. Soviet-Afghan side would be prepared to open dialogue under auspices of
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Special Representative.</p>
                    <p>—B. Participation in talks by Kabul regime as party and not government was
                        acceptable.</p>
                    <p>—C. Discussions would not imply recognition of <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> government.</p>
                    <p>—D. Soviet and Afghan Ambassadors at <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would
                        be instructed to follow agreed line.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> went on to say that they
                        had told Smirnov that they would inform <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> of proposal and advise him that he could check
                        directly with Moscow if he wished. Smirnov had inquired about what reaction
                        there would be from Iran, and <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> had
                        said that was one question Pakistan could not answer. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> then put question to Smirnov on whether
                        Soviet Union prepared to withdraw its forces. Smirnov replied that Soviets
                        would do so as soon as outside interference stopped. Paks then challenged
                        this view of situation, but finally agreed that there was basis for
                        proceeding with initiative. Soviets requested no publicity, but Paks
                        insisted that some public statement would be required. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Shahi</persName>’s carefully worded public remarks
                        constituted that statement.</p>
                    <p>8. Then, said <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>, on January 9
                        Soviet Ambassador called seeking urgent meeting with <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> was out of town but if it was a matter of real urgency
                        he could call at <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>’s
                        residence. Message that Smirnov brought was that President <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and his government had given an
                        interpretation to <gloss target="#t_Pak_1">Pak</gloss>-Soviet understanding
                        which was “not quite correct.” Therefore Moscow had not sent instructions to
                        delegations in New York. In addition <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> regime had informed Soviets it would not accept any
                        initiative that came under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution.
                        Finally Pakistan had introduced Iran into equation. <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak Karmal</persName> had reacted to this by saying
                        that only bilateral talks <pb n="906" facs="0951" xml:id="pg_906"/>between
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan were acceptable and that <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Special Representative could only participate in these
                        discussions as an observer, not as a participant.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> said he had told Smirnov
                        that he was “deeply disappointed” by what he had heard. There had been a
                        clear understanding that Iran and the <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>’s
                        Special Representative would be participants. He would have to consult his
                        President. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> said that he was
                        quite taken aback to hear Smirnov at this late date say that he did not see
                        how it would be possible to have a conference under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> auspices in view of General Assembly resolution “hostile to
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Afghan Government.”</p>
                    <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> took over at this point to say
                        that as a result of these developments <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                        position was firmer than ever that any initiative must be under General
                        Assembly resolution or “at least under auspices of Secretary General whose
                        authority in this matter derives from that resolution.” Obviously any
                        conference must include Iran. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s
                        conclusion: “The Soviets have got cold feet.” I asked <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> for a few clarifications. Had Smirnov
                        blamed all of this sudden shift on the Afghans? Yes. Including unwillingness
                        to include Iran in discussions? Yes. In fact, said <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Babrak
                            Karmal</persName> was directly quoted as saying, “Relations between Iran
                        and Afghanistan are none of Pakistan’s business.” Would the Kabul regime
                        accept participation as a party and not as a government? Yes. In fact, that
                        was one thing Smirnov said Afghans were satisfied with.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> still felt it had made a wise move. If
                        initiative had moved in the right direction everybody would have benefitted.
                        If it didn’t, as it now appeared would be the case, the onus would be on
                        Soviets. I replied that in view of what I had just been told it seemed that
                        many of our concerns were quite justified. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>
                        concurred. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> said that
                        obviously next move was up to Soviets, after he formally conveyed President
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName>’s negative reaction to
                        Ambassador Smirnov. I said that there was still one point of difference
                        between us which I thought was important: While <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> would be prepared to see some kind of discussion take place
                        simply under auspices of <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> Special
                        Representative we felt that link to General Assembly resolution must be
                        quite explicit. Neither <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> nor
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> reacted positively to
                        this thought. As to what happens next, <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> said I could be assured I would be kept fully informed
                        on each development and that the details of what had taken place between
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> and Smirnov he and I
                        had heard together for the first time. As to the future we were in complete
                        agreement that the Islamic Summit must not in any way dilute the Islamic
                        world’s stand on Afghanistan. He was totally committed to this position
                        until there was some sign that the Soviets were genuinely ready to
                        compromise.</p>
                    <p><pb n="907" facs="0952" xml:id="pg_907"/>12. I observed that it seemed to me
                        the Soviets had for their own reasons used the reported objections by the
                        puppet Babrak govt as the excuse for completely revising the position they
                        had first taken. This sort of Sov behavior lay at the base of the strong
                        concerns the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has had about how the Sovs
                        might twist future scenario of any talks as they unfolded. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName> wryly agreed, and said it would not be the first
                        time in their experiences with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        that the Sovs blandly reneged on their commitments.</p>
                    <p>13. At this point I tried to close the conversation; but <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>, as he often does, wanted to
                        remind me of the collusion that <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> sees
                        between the Soviets and India. He cited a recent book in which several GOI
                        officials are quoted as acknowledging that <persName corresp="#p_AH_2">Amin</persName> had suggested that India should move toward the
                        dismemberment of Pakistan on more than one occasion. I said I was not
                        surprised that Sovs and Afghans wanted to enlist India in pressures on
                        Pakistan, but by <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Shahnawaz</persName>’ own
                        account India had rejected these suggestions, so I could not see any new
                        significance in terms of Indian intentions.</p>
                    <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_ZM_1">Zia</persName> closed the conversation by
                        saying that in reporting this conversation he hoped I would make sure that
                        Washington understands that despite the fact that the Soviets appeared to be
                        backing out of what they proposed, Pakistani public reaction had been very
                        positive on hearing there might be a chance for a political compromise. He
                        had received hundreds of letters in the last few days expressing relief that
                        a solution was in sight. The fear of Soviet or Soviet-Indian aggression is
                        very strong. If the confrontation is now to continue Pakistan must have
                        assurances that its security will be strengthened. The nation badly needs
                        some boost for its morale from its friends, he emphasized.</p>

                            Kabul is dated January 13. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, P810102–2344,
                            D810017–1088)</note></p>

                    <p>2. Summary: Stringent security measures were again imposed in Kabul last week
                        in the wake of an upsurge of violence in the city and heightened rumors of
                        further trouble. An incident involving the Pol representative may have been
                        responsible for the sudden initiation of police checks of diplomatic
                        vehicles during the week. (Several Embassies plan to protest police excesses
                        during those checks, and all Embassies have advised personnel to be home
                        earlier.) Some foreign residents are accelerating their departures,
                        resulting in heavily booked outbound flights after the termination of a
                        charter for an Austrian 707 aircraft. Electrical outages have continued in
                        Kabul, though a Western diplomat saw no damage to major facilities during a
                        drive up from Peshawar last week.</p>
                    <p>3. Further reports of fighting in the countryside have filtered into Kabul,
                        many maintaining that the Afghan and Soviet forces have suffered fresh
                        drubbings. Sources also claim that Soviet troops killed another family in
                        Ghazni and that they continue to sell military equipment on the black
                        market. Afghan soldiers are continuing to protest extensions of military
                        service in a variety of ways, though some of them may merely be resisting
                        being sent to fight in the provinces. Some soldiers report that Soviet
                        troops are again grumbling about being misled—specifically by <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>—about their mission in
                        Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the <persName corresp="#p_KB_1">Karmal</persName>
                        regime announced the release of more political prisoners and inaugurated an
                        Afghan-Soviet friendship hall. <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> still
                        can tell us nothing about the reported death of an American “military
                        advisor” in December.<note n="3" xml:id="d346fn3">Telegram 341423 to Kabul,
                            December 30, notified the Embassy of news stories by United Press
                            International and United News of India about an “American military
                            advisor” who was killed near the Iranian border. The Department
                            requested further information, but the Embassy was unable to verify the
                            information. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                            further noted that the Pakistani Ambassador was “not sanguine about
