        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the
          official documentary historical record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
          significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series documents the
          facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies and includes evidence of
          supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
        <p>The Historian of the Department of State is responsible for the preparation of the <hi
            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The editing of the series in the Office of
          the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, is guided by principles of historical objectivity
          and accuracy. Documents are not altered or deletions made without indicating where changes
          have been made. Every effort is made to identify lacunae in the record and to explain why
          they have occurred. Certain omissions may be necessary to protect national security or to
          condense the record and avoid needless repetition. The published record, however, omits no
          facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision, and nothing has been omitted
          for the purpose of concealing or glossing over a defect in policy.</p>
        <p>At the time of the compilation of this volume in 1978 and 1979, the Department was guided
          in the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series by official
          regulations first promulgated by Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName>
          on March 26, 1925. A new statutory charter for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Foreign Relations</hi> series was established by Title IV of Public Law 102–138, the
          Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by the
          President on October 28, 1991. That new charter requires that the <hi rend="italic"
            >Foreign Relations</hi> series “shall be a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary
          record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States
          diplomatic activity.” The new charter also requires that the Foreign Relations series be
          published “not more than 30 years after the events recorded.”</p>
        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations of the
            United States Series</hi></p>
        <p>This volume is part of a comprehensive subseries of 27 printed volumes and 4 microfiche
          supplements that document the most important issues in the foreign policy of President
            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>’s administration. The
          subseries covers the years 1955 through 1957. In planning the overall scope of the <hi
            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes for <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"
          />the 1955–1957 triennium, the editors chose to present the documentation on U.S.
          relations with and policy toward the nations of Europe in five separate volumes: <ref
            target="frus1955-57v04">Volume IV, Western European Security and Integration</ref>; <ref
            target="frus1955-57v05">Volume V, Austrian State Treaty; Summit and Foreign Ministers
            Meetings, 1955</ref>; <ref target="frus1955-57v24">Volume XXIV, Soviet Union and the
            Eastern Mediterranean</ref>; <ref target="frus1955-57v25">Volume XXV, Eastern
            Europe</ref>; <ref target="frus1955-57v26">Volume XXVI, Central and Southeastern
            Europe</ref>; and <ref target="frus1955-57v27">Volume XXVII, Western Europe. U.S.-Soviet
            relations</ref> dominate all these volumes, which were designed to address the major
          themes and topics in those relations as well as the principal political and economic
          aspects of U.S. relations and policies with the various nations of Europe. The scope and
          arrangement of the three volumes on Central and Eastern Europe reflect no particular
          geopolitical theories favored by the editors but rather respond to the need to present the
          considerable documentation on this area of U.S. foreign policy in three volumes of roughly
          equal length.</p>
        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
        <p>The law requires that the published record contained in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
            Relations</hi> series must reflect all major foreign policy decisions and activities and
          include relevant documentation from all government agencies and entities involved in
          foreign policy formulation, execution, or support. The historical records of the
          Presidents and their national security advisers together with the still larger body of
          documentation in the Department of State are the principal sources for the <hi
            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The National Archives and Records
          Administration, including the Presidential libraries that it administers, is the main
          repository and coordinating authority for historical government records and a major source
          for the documents and information included in the series. Specific sources used in
          preparing this volume are described in detail in the List of Sources, pages XI–XIV.</p>
        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Principles of Selection for <ref
              target="frus1955-57v26">Foreign Relations, 1955–1957, Volume XXVI</ref></hi></p>
        <p>This volume provides extensive documentation on U.S. policy toward Berlin and East
          Germany and on U.S. relations with West Germany, Austria, and Yugoslavia. Given the bulk
          of extant records, however, this volume includes only a selection of the most important
          documents dealing with U.S. policy toward the nations of Central and Southeastern
          Europe.</p>
        <p>Several important topics have been used as the focal points for the selection of
          documents included in this volume. The documentation on Austria concentrates on the new
          relationship that the United States brought about by the signing of the Austrian State
          Treaty, while that on the Federal Republic of Germany examines the many facets of an
          already close relationship. Particular attention is given to <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V"
            facs="0009"/>the meetings between Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
            >Adenauer</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.
          The documentation on Berlin outlines the Western response to the isolation of the city and
          frequent harassment of access by the Soviet Union. Documentation on the German Democratic
          Republic concentrates on the formulation of policy within the National Security Council
          toward a state with which the United States had no formal relations. Documentation on
          Yugoslavia focuses on U.S. economic and military assistance and other support intended to
          maintain Yugoslavia’s independence from the Soviet bloc.</p>
        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was often personally involved
          in the formulation of policy toward the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin. The
          editors have used extensive materials available in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight
            D. Eisenhower</persName> Library, including the memoranda of discussion at National
          Security Council meetings and other institutional <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
          documents included in the Library’s Whitman file. Documents from the <persName
            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library or copies in Department of State files
          constitute a major portion of the materials printed in these compilations. The editors
          also consulted documents originated by the Central Intelligence Agency found among the
          collections of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library. That
          research was accomplished with the full cooperation and assistance of the <gloss
            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
        <p>The Department of State and the Embassies in Vienna and Belgrade played continuous and
          important roles in the policy process. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John
            Foster Dulles</persName> proposed various policies to the President and made significant
          decisions within the lines of established policies toward Austria and Yugoslavia, while
          the Embassies made important recommendations regarding all the major issues in U.S.
          relations with both countries. The editors have had complete access to all Department of
          State files including the central decimal files; the special files of the Executive
          Secretariat; the various decentralized (lot) files originally maintained at the bureau,
          office, or division level; and the Embassy and Berlin Mission files as retired to the
          Washington National Records Center of the National Archives and Records
          Administration.</p>
        <p>The Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were also involved in questions
          of military assistance, high-level discussions with West Germany, and the status and
          security of Berlin. The editors have had access to the records of the Office of the
          Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), declassified files of the Joint
          Chiefs of Staff at the National Archives and Records Administration, other specified files
          of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Army Communications Center cable files formerly
          reposed at the U.S. Army Military History Institute but now (1992) located at the National
          Archives.</p>
        <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>
        <p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its preparation
          for publication coincided with the development of procedures since early 1991 by the
          Central Intelligence Agency in cooperation with the Department of State that have expanded
          access by Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from among those
          records still in the custody of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Department of State
          chose not to postpone the publication of this volume to ascertain how such access might
          affect the scope of available documentation and the changes that might be made in the
          contents of this particular volume. The Department of State, however, is making good use
          of these new procedures, which have been arranged by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
            >CIA</gloss>’s History Staff, for the compilation of future volumes in the <hi
            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
        <p>The declassification review process for this volume, which is outlined in more detail
          below, resulted in the withholding of about 9 percent of the material originally selected
          for inclusion in the volume. For the most part, material was withheld because of national
          security requirements or continuing sensitivity in U.S. relations with the nations of
          Central Europe. The amount of material originally withheld (16.8 percent) was reduced
          after the recent political changes in Germany and Eastern Europe created an opportunity
          for constructive re-review of the manuscript by declassification officers. The editors of
          the volume are confident that the documents dealing with Austria, the Federal Republic of
          Germany, Berlin, the German Democratic Republic, and Yugoslavia provide an accurate record
          of U.S. relations with those countries during the 1955–1957 period.</p>
        <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the <persName
            corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Library, in particular David Haight;
          the National Archives and Records Administration; the Department of Defense; and other
          specialized repositories who assisted in the collection of documents for this volume.</p>
        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
        <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time. Incoming
          telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
          State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda of
          conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than
          the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
        <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
            Relations</hi> follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the Editor
          in Chief and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as
          possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
          Obvious typographical errors are corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source
            <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0011"/>text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
          correction is set in italic type; an omission in roman type. Bracketed insertions are also
          used to indicate text that has been omitted because it deals with an unrelated subject (in
          roman type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in italic type). The
          amount of material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or
          pages of source text that were omitted. The amount of material omitted because it was
          unrelated, however, is not accounted for. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the
          source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
        <p>The first footnote to each document includes the document’s source, original
          classification, distribution, and drafting information. This source footnote also provides
          the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the President or
          his principal policy advisers read it. Every effort has been made to determine if a
          document has been published previously, and this information has been included in the
          source footnote.</p>
        <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in
          this volume, point out the location of additional documentary sources, provide references
          to important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and
          summarize and give citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the
          printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been
          used when necessary to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi></p>
        <p>Declassification review of the documents selected for publication was conducted by the
          Historical Documents Review Division, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Department of State.
          The review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order
          12356 on National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
        <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the following
          categories, and whose disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the
          national security, requires classification: <list>

        <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release as much information as is
          consistent with contemporary requirements of national security and sound foreign
          relations. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
          and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S.
          Government, and appropriate foreign governments regarding the documents of those
          governments.</p>

            <p>We have reviewed the Army memorandum on Stockpile A which you transmitted to me by
              your memorandum of May 20, 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">Not found in Department of

              Austrians has been under study in this Department, and we have had a number of
              discussions with members of your staff. As a result, the Department queried Ambassador
                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> for his views on this matter. His
              reply (Vienna 2803, May 18, 1955, Top Secret)<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">In telegram
                2803, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> recommended that the United
                States turn over gendarmérie-type equipment from stockpile A to Austria before the
                phase-out of U.S. installations and personnel from Austria. (Department of State,
                Central Files, 663.001/5–1855)</note> sets forth a proposed course of action which
              is concurred in by the Department.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, the Department believes that the following steps should be taken: <list>
                <label>(1)</label>
                <item>The Department of Defense should initiate an action to obtain a Section 401
                  Presidential determination prior to June 30, 1955. This determination would
                  authorize the transfer of equipment in the amount of $20 million from Stockpile A
                  to the Austrian Government. A further Presidential determination under Section 401
                  would be sought to authorize turning over an additional $20 million of equipment
                  from Stockpile A to the Austrian Government as early as possible in <gloss
                    target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956.<note n="5" xml:id="d1fn5">On June 16, President
                      <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> approved the $20 million
                    transfer of equipment to Austria under Section 401. On August 2, he approved an
                    additional $20 million worth of equipment under Section 103 of the Mutual
                    Security Act. (Memorandum, August 2; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 763.5–<gloss

                <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0030"/>
                <label>(2)</label>
                <item>The Commanding General, USFA, be authorized to make available to the Austrian
                  Government gendarmérie type equipment required for approximately 2,500 men. This
                  should complete the equipping of 8,500 men for the gendarmérie. To the extent
                  possible, equipment now in the hands of USFA should be used to meet these
                  requirements. This equipment and any other equipment previously loaned to the
                  Austrian Government for the gendarmérie should be a charge against Stockpile A,
                  and should be a part of the Section 401 determination.</item>
                <label>(3)</label>
                <item>Prior to the withdrawal of United States troops, any equipment additional to
                  that required for (2) above should be called forth from the Stockpile only to the
                  extent requested by the Austrians and with the concurrence of Ambassador <persName
                    corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and the Commanding General, USFA.</item>
                <label>(4)</label>
                <item>Except as any equipment may be moved under (2) and (3) above, the Stockpile
                  should remain at Leghorn and, after the withdrawal of United States troops from
                  Austria, it should be the responsibility of the Austrian Government to accomplish
                  the movement of the remaining part of the Stockpile from Leghorn into
                  Austria.</item>
                <label>(5)</label>
                <item>It is probable that the equipment which would be made available under the two
                  Section 401 determinations would meet Austrian needs prior to July 1, 1956.
                  However, to the extent that there may remain available in the Stockpile equipment
                  in excess of the $40 million proposed to be transferred in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                    >FY</gloss> 1955 and 1956, such equipment, if requested by the Austrians, and
                  justified by existing circumstances, could be made available on an emergency loan
                  basis pending the enactment of legislation or additional Presidential
                  determinations in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>It should be noted that it is probable that the Austrian Government may request
              equipment in addition to that presently contained in the Stockpile. It would probably
              be in the national interest of the United States to meet these requests if the
              Austrians demonstrate a need for this equipment and the ability to absorb and utilize
              it effectively.</p>
            <p>If you concur in the foregoing proposals, we should move rapidly to advise Ambassador
                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and the Commanding General, USFA, of
              their content and to secure the necessary Presidential action.</p>

              <label>3.</label>
              <item><p>a. It is recommended that the United States Forces, Austria (USFA) be
                  deployed to Northeast Italy, reorganized as a Special Weapons Support Force, and
                  redesignated as U.S. Army, Italy (<gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss>). The
                  timing of the redeployment should be as outlined in the phase-out plan contained
                  in the Appendix hereto. This action is contingent upon Italian ratification of
                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces Agreement (<gloss
                    target="#t_SOF1">SOF</gloss>) or its equivalent.</p>
                <p>b. If arrangements with the Italian Government cannot be consummated in time to
                  meet the withdrawal deadline, appropriate forces will be withdrawn to Germany
                  until such time as the necessary arrangements have been made for their
                  redeployment to Northeast <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0032"/>Italy. Depending
                  upon the progress of negotiations and the acquisition or construction of interim
                  facilities, it may be possible to redeploy some of these forces direct to Italy
                  with the remainder going temporarily to Germany until such time as they can be
                  sent to Italy.</p>
                <p>c. The primary mission of <gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss> would be to
                  provide special weapons support for allied forces protecting the vital approaches
                  to Italy in the Villach–Ljubljana area.</p>
                <p>d. <gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss> will have a strength of
                  approximately 5000 (subject to detailed planning <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1"
                    >USCINCEUR</gloss>) which will be provided within the Army over-all personnel
                  ceiling for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956. The major combat units to be
                  contained in <gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss> will consist of Corporal
                  surface-to-surface missile battalion(s), Honest <persName>John</persName> rocket
                  batteries, and appropriate security units. Adequate logistic and administrative
                  units will be included for support of <gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss>,
                  U.S. Air Force and other U.S. agencies in Northern Italy.</p>
                <p>e. <gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss> would be a uniservice command

                  operational control except that authority to expend atomic weapons will remain in
                  U.S. command channels.</p></item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>In respect to lines of communication, it will be necessary to maintain the
                present Leghorn base area to provide support for the above proposed <gloss
                  target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss>. This will require that the present facilities
                at Verona be expanded to an advance general depot and that modified emergency type
                facilities be constructed in Northeast Italy for U.S. Army combat and direct support
                units. <gloss target="#t_USARIT1">USARIT</gloss> would provide interservice support
                to the U.S. Air Force and Naval forces and other U.S. agencies in Northern Italy as
                directed by <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>. The U.S. Air Force has
                planned additional requirements in the Leghorn base area to support U.S. Air Force
                units to be stationed in Italy.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>In connection with the above recommendations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff desire

                    been partially met in the past by the US-UK-French forces deployed in Austria,
                    as well as by Italian and Yugoslavian forces deployed in their respective
                    countries in accordance with their national capabilities. The capability of
                    holding that flank by the forces named has been considered to be extremely
                    marginal. This overall weakness was magnified by Yugoslav reluctance to make
                    even covert commitments to the West or coordinate any effective planning with
                    the Allies. Therefore, from a military point of view, the neutralization of
                    Austria and the withdrawal of occupation forces, coupled with the general
                    Yugoslav tendency toward neutrality and possible rapprochement with the Soviet
                    Bloc, increase the weakness in the southern <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0033"
                    />flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and close a primary source of
                    extremely important intelligence on the adjacent areas. Under the eventuating
                    circumstances, the Villach–Ljubljana Gap area can become an undefended avenue of
                    approach to Northeast Italy. The Soviet penetration of Italy could result in: <list>

                  <item><gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> has indicated that during a recent
                    conversation the Italian Minister of Defense stated that the possible movement
                    of U.S. units to Italy would present no tremendous political problem provided
                    such units could be scattered in reasonably small groups. In this connection,
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff note that the size of units was not defined nor was
                    this point overly emphasized, but they would like to point out that any
                    restricted deployment with respect to size of units which would adversely affect
                    the combat effectiveness of U.S. forces deployed to Italy would be militarily
                    and logistically unacceptable.</item>

            <p>Austrian neutrality will be an armed neutrality and the Austrian Parliament has
              passed a resolution that states that Austria is resolved to defend its territory with
              all of the resources at its command. Such a policy is, I believe, in the interest of
              the United States. The Administration wishes to avoid a military vacuum in that
              country. There is in formation an Austrian gendarmérie which will be the nucleus of
              the Austrian Army once the Treaty enters into force. We have, with congressional
              approval, stockpiled equipment for an initial force of 28,000 men. Finally, we have
              received official Austrian Government secret requests for equipment for their
                army,<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">The Embassy in Vienna reported these requests in
                telegrams 2803, May 18, and 2858, May 24. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

              indications the Soviets might gladly furnish. We are now studying the ways and means
              by which to satisfy the Austrian requests under existing legislation.</p>
            <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Protection of US and UN Interests (Confidential).</hi></p>
            <p>A general provision for restoration of United Nations property, rights and interests
              is provided in Article 24 of the Treaty. It is deficient in two respects because of
              the negotiating history: 1) the date as of which United Nations property should be
              restored is the date on which hostilities commenced, and 2) property indirectly held
              is not covered. The date in the Article is partially unsatisfactory to the United
              States because the German authorities after annexing Austria enacted legislation in
              1940 (Bitumen Law) which had the effect of confiscating certain oil properties in
              which United States business firms (Socony–Vacuum and Standard Oil Company of New
              Jersey) had property interests. Accordingly, if restoration were made only to December
              7, 1941, that would find the Germans in possession of the property. To meet this
              problem an understanding was arrived at with Austrian officials by which they have
              undertaken to negotiate with the firms concerned regarding a settlement satisfactory
              to the parties concerned which will in effect restore the property interests of the
              firms as they existed in 1940.</p>
            <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0038"/>
            <p>The difficulty concerning restoration of United Nations property indirectly owned in
              Austria through German companies was also covered in the understanding reached with
              the Austrian officials by providing for appropriate satisfaction to the parties
              concerned.</p>
            <p>Finally, a point which was a political issue in Austria concerns certain United
              Nations property indirectly owned in the Soviet Zone of Austria which was nationalized
              by the Austrian Government in 1946. The Austrian officials have undertaken to see to
              it that the shares in the property in question are returned to the United Nations
              owner (i.e., to denationalize the foreign owned interests in the property).</p>
            <p>The principal United States property interests concerned in the foregoing
              understanding have been informed on a confidential basis of the action taken to
              protect their property and they are satisfied with the situation. From the standpoint
              of United States interests involved, there is no reason why the additional
              undertakings of the Austrian officials could not be made public, but as suggested
              above, they would be politically embarrassing to the Austrian Government since the
              understanding expands the Treaty coverage, and publicity at this time might
              conceivably result in some delay in ratification of the Treaty by others. Secondly, it
              creates some difficulty for the Austrian Socialists. The understanding is being made
              known to the Austrian Parliamentary committee concerned on a confidential basis and we
              are therefore seeking to cooperate with the Austrians in handling the matter in the
              United States on a basis of confidence as they have requested. Upon entry into force
              of the Treaty the understandings will be made public.</p>

            <p>The delivery to the Soviets by the Austrians of $150 million worth of goods under
              Article 22 of the State Treaty and the provisions of Article 29 could theoretically
              involve shipment of strategic materials from Austria to the Soviet bloc. It is
              expected, however, that the Austrians will be obliged to furnish only such materials
              or products as are normally produced in Austria, and Austria neither produces weapons
              nor does she produce many strategic goods in significant quantities. In addition, we
              have reason to believe the Austrian Government will continue to cooperate, as they
              have in the past, in controlling exports in conformity with the international
              standards set by <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. I should add that we and our
                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> partners have at our disposal means of
              controlling shipments of strategic goods into Austria, so as to avoid transit

            <p>The Committee on Jewish Claims against Austria, which represents persons or their
              families who were persecuted during the Nazi regime in Austria, including many United
              States citizens who are former Austrian nationals, has received an Austrian Government
              offer of a settlement in broad terms. The Committee has informed us that it considers
              the offer a satisfactory one and will send representatives to Vienna later this month
              to negotiate the details of a final settlement. Both parties to the negotiations have
              kept us informed, but at the same time have requested that the offer and response be
              kept confidential. It may interest you to know that when I was in Vienna last month I
              discussed this problem twice with the Austrian Chancellor. It is heartening to note
              that for the first time agreement on a basis for settlement has been reached and that
              a final agreement at an early date on a basis satisfactory to both sides seems

            <p>3204. Although leaders of both parties have recently made statements indicating their
              realization of importance of development adequate Austrian defense forces, there have
              also been numerous reports circulating to effect that Aust Army might be established
              on excessively modest basis. Socialists have for instance been reported as pressing
              for military service of only four months.</p>
            <p>In view of these reports I called on <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> and
              Schaerf this morning to emphasize our interest in Aust defense plans. I said that Aust
              Army was not only technical and internal political question, but it had wide
              international significance. If for instance Aust did not undertake creation of defense
              forces which would appear reasonable and adequate in eyes of world, they would be
              leaving military <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>vacuum here which would make
              nonsense of neutrality policy and would vitiate Austria’s voice in world councils.
              Aust failure to carry its fair share of free world defense burden would also have
              serious effect on defense efforts of other small European nations, thus starting a
              deterioration which might have most unfortunate results for us all.</p>
            <p>As far as US direct interest was concerned I explained that we were endeavoring to
              arrange turnover to Austria of substantial quantities of military equipment, that no
              matter what compensation Austria gave us it would probably not amount to more than
              fraction of real cost and that therefore American taxpayer was, in effect, making a
              considerable investment in Aust defense. From both technical and political points of
              view US was concerned that best possible use be made of this investment. I therefore
              expressed hope that technical as well as political considerations would be taken into
              account in reaching final decisions.</p>
            <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> and Schaerf stated emphatically that
              they were fully aware of considerations I had mentioned and were determined that Aust
              would have adequate army. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> pointed out that
              it was Aust Govt which took initiative in asking for elimination of restrictive
              military clauses in State Treaty, and that both parties were agreed that there should
              be universal and effective military training which would result in creation within few
              years of trained manpower reserve of 500,000.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> also commented that he was most impressed
              with training and effectiveness of special gendarmérie which would provide excellent
              cadres for army. He asked whether American support could be continued on present basis
              till end of this year. I said we were anxious to be of such help as we could, that we
              were presently authorized to continue gendarmérie support only until treaty entry into
              force. However, General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> was waiting
              further authorizations from Washington on several matters concerning turnover <gloss
                target="#t_mil1">mil</gloss> equipment, etc, which he expected within next week or
              two. When these authorizations received we would be calling on <persName
                corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> and Schaerf to discuss details.</p>
            <p>I believe interview was salutary and that chances are good that parties will soon
              reach agreement on military program which will provide basis for reasonably effective
              Aust defense effort.</p>

            </list>
            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> and I called on the
              Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor today to discuss military assistance to Austria.</p>
            <p>I made a general statement, pointing out that American policy has been consistent in
              supporting Austria’s defense effort and cited as evidence U.S. support of the
              Gendarmérie during the past five years. I indicated that of current Austrian requests,
              we had been able to meet some fully, others partially, and still others were under
              consideration. I said that we felt we had made considerable progress in meeting
              Austrian requests at this early stage.</p>
            <p>I explained that there were two general criteria which governed the extent of our
              assistance. The first was our laws and congressional authorizations, the second and
              more important since it determined the limits of the first, the Austrian Government’s
              plans and ability to use U.S. assistance effectively. Hence the U.S. would follow with
              great interest Austrian plans and progress in the development of its military forces
              and hoped to be kept currently and fully informed.</p>
            <p>I noted our awareness of Austria’s problems, both political and financial, and the
              wish of Austrian Government leaders to move ahead promptly and efficiently, but added
              that we must consider Austrian plans in the light of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> standards which prescribe two years normal and one and one-half years
              minimum service for adequate training of modern reserve forces. We desired to continue
              our cooperation with the Austrian Government in all ways legislatively possible and
              warranted by Austrian efforts.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated that Austrian plans to establish an army were further forward
              than we realized but that a one and one-half or two year term of military service in
              Austria was currently out of the question. I acknowledged our understanding of this
              but hoped for future improvement.</p>
            <p>I then expressed the hope that the Austrian Government would view sympathetically the
              U.S. desire to have military air and ground transit rights across Austria after the
              entry into force of the State Treaty. I added that we would also like to obtain
              special favorable rail rates for this traffic. In discussing this subject further
              General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> explained that we might want
              to send sealed freight and personnel trains across the Tyrol between Germany and Italy
              and receive <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0045"/>permission for military planes to
              overfly Austria on more or less the same route.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated that he would have to consult his Government. He added that as
              long as the Russians were here this was extremely difficult, but that he would in the
              future consider sympathetically specific requests we might have.</p>
            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> then expressed his dismay at
              the slowness of the Austrian effort in military matters, emphasizing the deleterious
              effect this has on U.S. opinion.</p>
            <p>He stated that the U.S. had equipment, valued at twenty million dollars which would
              equip seventeen thousand men, ready for transfer to the Austrians. This equipment was
              now in the hands of the Gendarmérie, the Vienna police, and the greatest bulk in
              Italy. He requested that the Austrians designate a representative empowered to
              negotiate the transfer. We would request the Austrians to pay the freight on the
              shipment of this matériel in Italy from the Brenner, whence we would ship it, to
              places of storage in Austria. We would also request the Austrians to supply a labor
              force, preferably Gendarmerie in work clothes to effect the storage of the matériel.
              The Austrians must also assume responsibility for the guarding and maintenance of
              equipment, while we would provide the necessary documentation (locator cards, et
              cetera). General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> indicated that we
              were endeavoring to obtain additional authorizations, the extent of which would depend
              on the impression made by Austrian energy and utilization. The Chancellor agreed to
              designate representatives soonest, Monday or Tuesday of next week, to discuss the
              details of the turnover.</p>
            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> next turned over to the
              Chancellor a series of folders, containing detailed descriptions of U.S. installations
              in Austria—what the U.S. forces found there when they first occupied the
              installations, what was constructed by the U.S., and what improvements had been made.
              The General stated that we were required by U.S. laws to receive value consideration
              upon transfer, in contra-distinction to the stockpile equipment, and that we hoped to
              reach an agreement under which the Austrian authorities would assume certain claims
              against the U.S. occupation forces. It was pointed out to the Chancellor that this had
              been mentioned by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in
              conversations before he left.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated that the Finance Ministry was the competent agency to negotiate
              the detailed agreement and that this would be arranged for next week.</p>
            <p>In this connection, General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> and I
              pointed out that the buildings contained fixtures but would not contain furnishings
              since such moveable equipment would have to be transferred to other U.S. units. The
              Chancellor indicated agreement with this view.</p>
            <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0046"/>
            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> stated that he expected to
              continue his negotiations in a friendly and reasonable atmosphere, but did not intend
              to be held up by certain claimants. The Chancellor agreed to pass the word along,
              particularly in the U.S. Zone of occupation, that unreasonable demands were not to be
              made of U.S. occupation forces.</p>
            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> passed a letter to the
                Chancellor,<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Not found in Department of State files.</note>
              containing advice regarding further financial assistance to the Gendarmérie.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated he had no further questions to raise at this time.</p>

            <head>8. Editorial Note</head>
            <p>On September 16, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported
              that, according to the Vienna press, the Soviet Union, in response to an Austrian
              request, had decided to grant Austria arms and ammunition. (Telegram 808; Department
              of State, Central Files, 763.56/9–1655) Later the same day, Ambassador <persName
                corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported that Austrian officials, surprised at
              the announcement, believed that the request which Moscow referred to was a statement
              by Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> in which he indicated that
              Austria would accept arms from any source. It was further believed that Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> had worked out the offer with the Soviet
              Ambassador. Although Austrian officials were uninformed of the details, Ambassador
                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> noted that they did not expect any
              conditions to be attached by Moscow. Some Austrians favored the acceptance of arms
              from the Soviet Union to illustrate Austria’s absolute neutrality. (Telegram 822; <hi

            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> came in at his request this
              afternoon for the purpose of giving Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                >Merchant</persName> assurances with respect to the Soviet offer to provide military
              equipment for Austria. The views expressed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GK1"
                >Gruber</persName> were, in substance, similar to those expressed to officers of
                <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss> on September 16 (see memorandum of September 20
              from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> to Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>).<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Not found in
                Department of State files.</note></p>
            <p>Dr.<persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> said that he had received no further
              reports from his government in regard to this matter since his conversation with us on
              September 16. He said, however, that he had had extensive conversations in Vienna in
              August with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> and Foreign Minister
                <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> and that he is 100 per cent convinced
              that Austria has no intention of being armed by the Soviets for two reasons: (1) the
              use of Soviet arms by Austria would create an impossible logistics problem and (2)
              Austria has no intention of endangering its present good relations with the West. He
              said that, in his opinion, the Soviets were faced with the alternative of either
              registering complaint concerning the furnishing of arms by the US or furnishing arms
              themselves and that faced with this alternative and with the fact that they had no
              legitimate basis under the treaty for protesting the furnishing of arms by the US, the
              Soviets logically decided to furnish some arms themselves. Ambassador <persName
                corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> does not believe that any equipment furnished by
              the Soviets will be modern or in very great quantity (he is aware of the list of
              Soviet arms given to General <persName corresp="#p_ALGWH1">Arnold</persName> by
              General Liebitzky). He is convinced that it is in the best interests of us all that
              Austria accept the Soviet offer to furnish arms inasmuch as this will lay the
              groundwork for the US to furnish more equipment later without protest from the
              Soviets.</p>
            <p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> agreed that the Soviet action
              would remove any basis for Soviet complaint over the furnishing of US arms. He
              stressed the importance of Austria keeping us informed concerning the details of any
              equipment received from the Soviets in order that our Defense Department and the
              Congress if necessary may have the complete picture and in order that we may be in a
              position to determine Austria’s needs for equipment in addition to that already turned
              over to them by the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed
              out the danger that the Soviet action may be “the camel’s nose under the tent” and
              that it could possibly lead to a Soviet request for a military mission in Austria.
                <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> confirmed Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s impression that <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20"
                facs="0048"/>Austria has not received any request along these lines from the
              Soviets.</p>
            <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s inquiry,
              Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> said that the condition of the
                <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> factories turned over to the Austrians by the
              Soviets is as a whole much better than was expected; that some of the factories are in
              fact in fairly good <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss>. Ambassador <persName
                corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> mentioned in this connection that the
              International Bank is sending a mission to Austria to look into the problem of
              investment needs for these <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> factories.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> referred to the fact that the
              Western Powers are currently studying Austrian draft legislation on neutrality and
              confirmed our impression that no formal action will be taken by Austria in this matter
              until after the deadline for the withdrawal of occupation forces, i.e., October
              25.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> concluded the conversation by
              observing that there is no “new religion” in Austria; that Austria is just as
              Western-minded as ever and that its first objective has been to rid itself of the
              Eastern grip on its territory; that Austria must proceed very carefully, however, as
              long as it still has economic obligations under the treaty and it cannot afford to
              create any political mistrust on the part of the Soviets until these obligations have
              been liquidated. He added that Austria’s courage will be more evidently displayed as
              soon as it becomes politically feasible to do so.</p>

                December 19, 1955, pp. 1011–1012.</note> the Secretary made various comments. The
              U.S. reply is being made not only because of the request of the Austrian Government
              but in the confident belief that Austria is not and will not be neutral in spirit but
              will keep its past ties with the West and secure its neutrality with all the resources
              at its disposal. The Secretary expressed his assurance that the Austrians realize the
              only place from which a threat can come and the meaning of Austrian dependence upon
              help from the West should such a threat materialize. Austria, he said, had
              demonstrated time after time its spiritual orientation toward the West and the U.S.
              does not assume that there will be any change in that orientation.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> replied that despite the new
              economic problems facing Austria, the Secretary’s assurance about the orientation of
              Austria is well founded. Austria, he said, is ready to do all that is necessary to
              meet a threat from the East and all Austrians, with the exception of a handful of
              Communists, may be counted upon.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then referred to the military aid Austria had received from the Soviets
              and the risks involved in Austria becoming dependent on the East for not only
              equipment but ammunition and <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0050"/>spare parts.
              Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> assured the Secretary of
              Austrian awareness of the danger and that Austrian military strength will be
              established in the right way and with care to avoid dependence on the Soviets.</p>
            <p>The conversation closed with expressions by the Secretary of his happiness at having
              attended the opening of the opera and equally, the ball that followed. He said that at
              the time the treaty was signed, he had shared the Austrian desire for an end to the
              occupation before the opening of the opera which he considered to be a symbol almost
              as important as the treaty itself. It was, he remarked, a great pleasure to have been
              able to fulfill his long-standing wish to attend and he had been greatly impressed by
              the true Viennese atmosphere of the ball. The Ambassador replied that his Government
              had been exceedingly pleased by the Secretary’s attendance and that the celebration
              had indeed been a great occasion.</p>

            <head>12. Editorial Note</head>
            <p>On December 13, Austria’s Cabinet refused to guarantee the proposed Soviet loan to
              Lower Austria. Two days later, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName>
              publicly endorsed the loan, but on December 20, the Socialists within the Austrian
              Cabinet again defeated the Federal guarantee.</p>
            <p>Those in favor of the loan claimed that it would promote the development of Lower
              Austria, demonstrate Austria’s absolute neutrality, and keep the Soviets from dumping
              inflationary schilling accounts on Austria. Those in opposition to the loan countered
              that it would affront the Western world, spur the economic drive of the Soviet Union,
              and condone the secrecy and nongovernmental channels in which it was negotiated by the
              provincial government of Lower Austria. Opponents further argued that the Soviet Union
              possessed too few schillings to ruin the Austrian economy.</p>
            <p>The Soviet news agency, TASS, reported on December 24 that Lower Austria had
              approached the Soviet Union for a loan of 500 million schillings the previous October.
              Lower Austria had requested a Federal guarantee for 800 million schillings. TASS
              announced that if the guarantee came through the loan was still available. (Despatch

                to reach a strength of 25,000–30,000 men by late 1956. It is possible that an
                effective Austrian defense force will require additional military assistance in view
                of the lack of manpower and particularly the anticipated lack of budgetary
                resources. The Austrian Army, as it is now constituted and envisaged for the future,
                will be capable of maintaining internal security and protecting the Austrian borders
                in minor border incidents; however, it will not be able to offer more than token
                resistance in the face of a Soviet and/or Satellite military invasion of any
                magnitude.</item>

            <p>1863. Department was prepared for post-treaty period in which Austrian Government
              would display various signs of going through shakedown period involving coalition
              difficulties, uncertainties as to use of newly won sovereignty and groping for proper
              application policy military neutrality. Recent developments have however proved more
              disturbing than expected and have produced Austrian trends difficult analyze. Such

              possible Austrian recognition Communist China could constitute signs serious adverse
              trends in development attitudes and policies post-treaty Austria. There are also some
              indications that contrary expectations Austrian Government applying neutrality policy

              effort balance moves toward East and West, e.g., we were not surprised by recognition

              committee at this time would be highly disadvantageous and earnestly hope it can be
              avoided. A reassuring picture, which I believe is justified in the long run, would
              encourage Austrians to think recent waverings have gone unnoticed while alarmist
              picture would be likely stir up political issues here contrary to our interests.
              Helmer’s recent article in <hi rend="italic">Die Zukunft</hi> only one of indications
              that Socialists not adverse to having choice between East and West become an election
              issue since they realize country is and will remain pro-West.</p>
            <p>I have of course been disturbed by recent developments as have many Austrians both
              Socialist and Peoples Party but do not believe they are as significant as indicated in
              reference telegram. Many of them have their roots in domestic issues. Had the Soviet
              loan been for the Tirol I am sure <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> would
              have opposed it. The non-renewal of foreign trade law was chiefly due to Peoples Party
              unwillingness to pay Socialists’ price, and for present I believe Austria will
              continue collaboration on control strategic material. Albanian recognition largely due
              to efforts obtain release of Austrian prisoners and offset establishment relations
              Germany and Spain. Chinese recognition of course much more serious problem but do not
              believe imminent.</p>
            <p>Against these moves must be considered Austrian cooperation in military field such as
              transit rights which I understand will shortly be approved, the attitude of the
              Austrian press which has in general taken strong anti-Communist line, cooperation re
              neutrality declaration, et cetera.</p>
            <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0058"/>
            <p>Root of present problem is attitude of Chancellor. I am submitting by mail analysis
              his position<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">Reference is to despatch 607, January 12,
                1956. (Department of State, Central Files, 763.13/1–1256)</note> but briefly I
              believe he is obviously endeavoring to prepare ground for obtaining Soviet concessions
              on payments for German assets and to obtain best terms in current negotiations in
              mistaken idea concessions can be obtained without cost. (Kreisky told me <persName
                corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> is furious that Socialists are insisting upon
              pushing Austrian entry Council of Europe because of effect on his dealings with
              Soviets.) While I am convinced that <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> is
              basically sound he has I believe been misled by success of his negotiations in Moscow
              and subsequently into thinking that he can out-smart the Soviets and this combined
              with his provincial outlook and lack of experience in foreign affairs will continue to
              cause us trouble. He dominates his party and is one of the few in it who have
              qualities of statesmanship and courage. In a showdown he might well be our staunchest
              supporter and for present attitude of Socialists and large section of his own party
              will probably prevent his going very far in ill-advised maneuvers.</p>
            <p>Prepared return for consultation at any time but believe this should be deferred
              pending further developments.</p>

            <p>After Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had briefed the National Security Council on
              the contents of the reference progress report, the President said he wished to pose a
              question. Why shouldn’t our propaganda organs jeer at the Soviets for insisting on
              taking millions of barrels of oil annually from a small poor country like Austria?
              Would it not be possible to get local information media to do this kind of a job for
                <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0059"/>us? After all, Austria had been an invaded
              country and not a willing ally of Hitler.</p>
            <p>In response to the President’s question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                >Dulles</persName> cited the legal authority on which the Soviets were basing their
              claims to this oil; namely, agreement by the Allies that Nazi assets in Austria were
              to go to the Soviet Union. Strictly speaking therefore, the oil was not booty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, however, believed that the
              President’s idea could be used at least in covert propaganda. Secretary <persName
                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also pointed out that there was even a larger
              field for the exercise of the President’s idea because it applied not only to Austria
              but to the Soviet satellites as well. In practice the Soviets were squeezing out the
              resources of their satellites and then turning around to make generous offers to the
              peoples of the free Asian states.</p>
            <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then stated that he had a
              suggestion to make. Would it not be worthwhile to undertake a study of the
              possibilities of reaching back from countries like Austria and Finland on the
              periphery of the Soviet Union in order to effect evolutionary changes in the U.S.S.R.
              Such a program should be of a long-term character, perhaps over a period of ten
              years.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that Governor <persName
                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s idea was probably already included in agreed
                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy. Accordingly, it would be more
              appropriate to refer his proposal to the Operations Coordinating Board for study of
              ways and means of executing such a program. The President and the Secretary of State
              expressed agreement with Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s view.</p>

            <p>On January 23, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported
              that Austrian Finance Minister Kamitz thought that the Soviet loan proposal was a
              closed issue. (Telegram 1756 from Vienna; Department of State, Central Files,
              863.10/1’2356) The Socialists never wavered in their opposition to financial
              assistance from the Soviet Union and defeated the <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32"
                facs="0060"/>loan proposal a third and final time within the Austrian Cabinet
              February 16–18.</p>
            <p>The position of the Socialists was strong because of support from the World Bank, the
              United States, and pro-Western Austrians. First, the World Bank notified Austria that
              it would be reluctant to participate in Soviet-funded projects. Then, on February 7,
              the United States concluded a P.L. 480 agreement with Austria for economic
              development. Finally, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> decided
              against pushing for the loan so as not to antagonize his pro-West voters.</p>
            <p>Deputy Chief of Mission <persName>Thomas K. Penfield</persName> observed that the
              defeat of the Soviet loan was important to the shaping of a pro-West Austrian image.
              Penfield further noted that the defeat was one of the first signals that Austria
              intended to interpret its neutrality in a strictly military sense rather than beyond
              the stipulations of the State Treaty. (Despatch 749 from Vienna, March 6; <hi

            <p>The Department has noted Rome’s telegram 3151 of March 14, 1956 repeated to Vienna as
              telegram 90,<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">Telegram 3151 from Rome reported that
                newspapers in Rome had announced that <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> and
                Italian officials had not discussed the South Tyrol question. At <persName
                  corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName>’s insistence, Italian officials publicly
                acknowledged that the issue had been taken up. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

              the occasion mentioned in the Department’s telegram 2762 to Rome,<note n="3"
                xml:id="d18fn3">Telegram 2762 to Rome reported that in February, Grauss had
                informally raised the South Tyrol question with the Department of State, which had
                maintained a position of nonintervention on the issue. (<hi rend="italic"
                  >Ibid.,</hi> 765.002/2–2556)</note> it was twice raised by a representative of the
              Italian Embassy during the week that began March 5.</p>
            <p>The Italian official indicated considerable concern on the part of the Italian
              Foreign Office over the possibility that the Austrian Government would make an issue
              of the question with the Italian Government <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0061"/>and
              attempt to enlist the aid of the United States Government. By implication, the Italian
              official imputed to the Austrian Government unseemly motives in doing so.</p>
            <p>The Department reassured him that no official effort to bring the United States
              Government into the controversy had been made by the Austrian Government, that the
              Department had received no indication that the matter was being made a major issue by
              the Austrians and reiterated the United States position expressed in previous
              Departmental communications to Embassies Rome and Vienna.</p>
            <p>It is encouraging to note the attitude of Minister Schoener as reported in the last
              paragraph of Rome’s telegram 3151,<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">Telegram 3151 reported
                Schoener’s opinion that future negotiations between Austria and Italy on the South

                765.022/3–1456)</note> and it is assumed that the sensitivity of the Italian
              Government on the South Tyrol question reflects concern over the continued support of
              the Segni Government by members of Parliament from the Alto Adige.</p>
            <p>With the forthcoming national elections in Austria and administrative elections in
              Italy, it is conceivable that one or both sides in the South Tyrol issue may find it
              expedient to exaggerate difficulties in the area concerned by alleging serious
              injustices. Barring new information concerning difficulties in the implementation of
              the <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName>–De Gasperi agreement or failure of
              sincere Italo-Austrian diplomatic efforts to resolve actual problems, the Department
              foresees no need to alter the present United States position.<note n="5"
                xml:id="d18fn5">The Embassy in Vienna confirmed that the Austrians had not recently
                raised the South Tyrol matter with U.S. officials. It further agreed with the

                realistic to expect any major alteration in the South Tyrol situation. (Despatch

            <p rend="center">DRAFT STATEMENT OF POLICY BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL ON U.S.
              POLICY TOWARD AUSTRIA</p>
            <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
            <p>1. The Austrian State Treaty, which came into force on July 27, 1955, ending the
              occupation and reestablishing Austria’s independence and sovereignty, marked the
              achievement of the major U.S. objective in Austria for the past ten years. The price,
              however, which Austria paid for Soviet willingness to conclude the Treaty was a policy
              of perpetual military neutrality and heavy economic obligations to the Soviet Union
              payable over 6 to 10 years.</p>
            <p>2. Austria, an integral part of free Europe, is a symbol of resistance to the
              Soviets. Austria is strategically important because of its position controlling
              important approaches to Western and Southern Europe, and the Danube gateway to the
              satellites.</p>
            <p>3. Soviet aims in Austria today are primarily to prevent close alignment with the
              West and to draw Austria as much as possible into the political and economic orbit of
              the USSR. Moreover, the Soviet Union hopes to use the Austrian example as an incentive
              to develop neutralism elsewhere. A weakening of Austria’s stability and pro-Western
              ties would constitute a serious setback for the United States.</p>
            <p>4. Austria’s post-Treaty neutrality as defined by law prevents it from entering
              military alliances or allowing the establishment of foreign military bases on Austrian
              territory. Austrian political leaders have interpreted this neutrality to mean that
              Austria is free to cooperate with the West in political, economic and cultural fields
              and to accept outside assistance in the establishment of its armed forces. The United
              States has encouraged Austria to adopt and maintain this interpretation of its
              neutrality to ensure Austria’s Western orientation and minimize the adverse influence
              on Austria and other nations of Soviet pressures to broaden Austria’s neutrality.</p>
            <p>5. Under the Austro-Soviet Memorandum of April, 1955, Austria is to seek a joint
              four-power guarantee of Austrian territorial integrity. In view of U.S. constitutional
              and political considerations, the <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0063"/>United States
              has adopted the policy “that the United States should be prepared to treat any
              violation of the integrity of Austrian territory or neutrality as a grave threat to
              the peace, without however guaranteeing its territory or neutrality, except within the
              framework of the UN” (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1388).</p>
            <p>6. United in resistance to the Soviets, a coalition of government of the equally
              powerful Socialist and conservative People’s parties, representing 83 per cent of the
              vote, has maintained political stability in Austria since the war. Removal of the
              common bond of opposition to Soviet occupation policies and the emergence of difficult
              problems, primarily economic, raised by the State Treaty, have exacerbated the basic
              differences between the two parties. However, as long as relatively favorable economic
              and international conditions prevail, moderate forces in Austria will remain vigorous
              enough to insure the maintenance of political democracy and stability.</p>
            <p>7. Austria, with the help of nearly $1.4 billion of U.S. aid since 1945, is
              relatively stable and prosperous, though inflationary pressures and balance of
              payments problems are present. Economic grant aid, last authorized in <gloss
                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953, is not now necessary. U.S. interests still warrant
              such continued economic cooperation as transactions under Public Law 480, and loans
              for sound projects through established lending institutions. [<hi rend="italic">3
                lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Potential Austrian dependence on Soviet
              bloc trade warrants continuing attention.</p>
            <p>8. After the State Treaty became effective, the Austrian Government established an
              Army [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Volunteers, and
              the first draft call anticipated for early 1957, will expand the present 7,000-man
              Army toward the goal of about 40,000 men. The Army is now capable of maintaining
              internal security, [<hi rend="italic">2-½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
              Bipartisan civilian control of the Army is a serious Austrian political issue.</p>
            <p>9. The United States has provided post-Treaty Austria with $22 million of military
              installations and, from a stockpile in Europe, $40 million of end-items. A balance of
              $17.4 million in end-items remains to be delivered from the stockpile; packing,
              transportation, etc., brings the remaining cost of delivering the stockpile to $20.2
              million. [<hi rend="italic">9-½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
            <p>10. While the Austrian Government, now completely responsible for refugees, has
              publicly stated its intention to provide adequate protection and care for them,
              continued Austrian cooperation in this program will probably require continued U.S.
              and international assistance and advice.</p>
            <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>
            <p rend="center">Objective</p>
            <p>11. Maintenance of an independent and stable Austria, and encouragement of its

              subversion.</p>
            <p rend="center">Courses of Action</p>
            <p>12. Make all feasible attempts to influence Austria to interpret its military
              neutrality in such a way as to minimize its restrictions and permit (a) continuance of
              its Western orientation, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                declassified</hi>], (c) its close cooperation with Western powers in all
              non-military fields, and (d) its participation in non-military organizations of the
              free world community.</p>
            <p>13. Minimize the influence of Austria’s neutrality on the defense and foreign
              policies of other free nations.</p>
            <p>14. Seek to discourage Austria from requesting a four-power guarantee of Austria’s
              territorial integrity; and failing that, limit any guarantee in which the United
              States will participate to one within the framework of the UN, without excluding,
              however, the possibility that conditions may warrant a tripartite Western declaration
              supporting Austria’s political and territorial integrity.</p>
            <p>15. Be prepared to treat any violation of the integrity of Austrian territory or
              neutrality as a grave threat to the peace.</p>
            <p>16. Encourage the continuance of coalition governments at least until a single party
              is capable of providing a stable and democratic government.</p>
            <p>17. Encourage Austria to raise and maintain armed forces adequate for internal
              security [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
            <p>18. Be prepared to grant or sell to Austria military end-items and other appropriate
              forms of military assistance, keeping in mind Austria’s interpretation of its military
              neutrality, the importance of avoiding Austrian dependence upon Soviet sources of
              supply, and the need for Austria’s economic stability and growth.</p>
            <p>19. Support Austrian efforts to insure that the armed forces are subordinate to
              national, bipartisan control and thus are not allowed to become a weapon which can be
              used by either party against the other.</p>

            <p>21. Seek to maintain Austria’s close economic ties with the West through continued
              participation in such organizations as the Organization for European Economic
              Cooperation and through such measures, where appropriate, as loans for sound projects

            <p>22. Continue the exchange-of-persons program and an active foreign information
              program.</p>
            <p>23. Protect the rights of American citizens under the State Treaty and other

              of property in Austria or provision for adequate compensation.</p>
            <p>24. Use all feasible measures to secure Austria’s continued acceptance of
              responsibility in granting asylum and protection to political refugees from the Soviet
              bloc, and integration into the Austrian economy or Austrian cooperation in
              resettlement of refugees and displaced persons. Continue as appropriate in U.S.

              <item>He mentioned that he saw Van Zeeland at the Belgian Embassy at dinner last night
                and learned that he had been retained by the Austrian Government to advise it on
                raising funds for the rehabilitation of the former <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                  >USIA</gloss> plants. Van Zeeland was under the impression that the U.S. had been
                “sticky” on that subject and we informed the Secretary that so far as we knew, the
                problem was that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> Mission to Austria had
                adopted a negative attitude, but that the U.S. had released counterpart for use in
                the former Soviet zone.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Paragraph 14 as it is going to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> reads:
                  <quote rend="blockquote">
                  <p>“Seek to discourage Austria from requesting a four-power guarantee of Austria’s
                    territorial integrity; and failing that, limit any guarantee in which the United
                    States will participate to one within <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0066"/>the
                    framework of the UN, without excluding, however, the possibility that conditions
                    may warrant a tripartite Western declaration supporting Austria’s political and
                    territorial integrity.”</p>
                </quote></item>
            </list>
            <p>I quote the entire paragraph as the latter part is, I think, new since the draft<note
                n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Not found in Department of State files.</note> we sent you a
              month or more ago. The Secretary’s question concerned the first clause and occurred to
              him when, in response to his query, we informed him that there was not yet tripartite
              agreement on the approach to the Austrians concerning the guarantee. He asked whether
              the clause would mean that we would make the attempt to discourage the Austrians from
              requesting a guarantee whether or not the British and French joined with us. In the
              ensuing discussion, the Secretary pointed out that as the paragraph reads, an effort
              one way or another would have to be made once the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
              approves. He then observed that while a tripartite approach would probably be
              preferable, a unilateral approach would be better than nothing. Bob Bowie argued that
              with the French interest in the <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> idea of the
              guarantee being aimed at preventing Anschluss, we might be better off going into the
              matter informally alone with the Austrians, as the French might prove a handicap in a
              tripartite effort. It was decided to leave the language as it is, partly because I
              pointed out to the Secretary that I thought you still had hopes of bringing the
              British and French into line but mainly because the Secretary clearly wishes to leave
              no stone unturned in our efforts to avoid an official Austrian request for a
              guarantee.</p>
            <p>Upon return to our offices, we found your Despatch 806 of March 28<note n="5"
                xml:id="d20fn5">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                663.0021/3–2856)</note> informing us that the British and French Ambassadors will,
              following the May elections, go along with you in an effort to discourage the
              Austrians from requesting a guarantee. We have, of course, informed the Secretary.
              However, given the Secretary’s views as recapitulated above, he will want you to make
              some kind of a unilateral approach to the Austrians should, by any chance, your
              British and French colleagues prove unwilling to join you at the appropriate time. In
              any event, it may prove desirable for you to supplement an eventual tripartite
              approach by talking to the Austrians alone and informally to assure that our arguments
              against guarantees are not diluted by joint representation. Since the hiatus before
              the election gives us time for consideration, perhaps you could reply by letter after
              which any necessary supplement or modifications of your present instructions could be
              sent you officially. Not having had time to study the new drafts attached to your
              Despatch 806, I refrain from commenting on them at this time.</p>
            <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>
            <p>As you will note, I am sending copies of this letter to Wally <persName

              London direct from Vienna as we are having difficulty doing so from here. The records

            <p>The Executive Secretary began to brief the Council on the contents of the reference
              report (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5603), and noted the concurrence of the
              Joint Chiefs of Staff. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> reached
              paragraphs 14 and 15, dealing with U.S. policy regarding the integrity of Austrian
              neutrality, he pointed out the possibility of a tripartite Western declaration
              supporting, though not guaranteeing, Austria’s political and territorial integrity.
              The President said that such a possibility did not worry him, since the declaration in
              this instance would not be unlike the 1950 tripartite declaration on the Arab-Israeli
              problem.</p>
            <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0068"/>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> at this point indicated that
              there was still a balance of $20 million worth of arms which would be delivered, if
              present schedules were followed, to the Austrians next year. Secretary <persName
                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wondered whether the Austrians were really ready
              to receive this final increment of arms that we were supplying them, and suggested the
              possibility of temporarily slowing up delivery of these arms. The President answered
              that this was a problem which would not be settled in the National Security Council,
              but that Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon
                Gray</persName> should look into the matter. After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1"
                >Lay</persName> had pointed out that the Staff Study indicated the possibility of a
              delay in the development of Austria’s armed forces, the President said that it would
              be all right to stagger delivery of this last $20 million worth of arms if it
              developed that Austria was not prepared to receive it.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he might mention
              that the Italians have told us that they had been approached by the Austrians with a
              request for additional arms. Accordingly, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                >Radford</persName> believed that Austrian military leaders at least were thinking
              in terms of enlarging the scope of Austria’s rearmament.</p>

              Best approach would be step by step procedure but difficult see how this could be

              we do so without any formal announcement and when question raised we might say
              something along following lines: “US is furnishing to Aust certain items of military
              equipment which have been requested by the Aust Gov. Most of this material will
              consist of items remaining undelivered from the stockpile set aside for Aust use at
              the time of withdrawal of US troops from Aust.” We will doubtless be pressed hard for
              some indication of types and quantities. To avoid alarming interpretations I suggest
              we state additional material will be much less than that already supplied to Aust. If
              and when queried re planes suggest we state Aust has requested training planes and it
              is hoped a small number can be furnished. In any statement which Austs make they will
              doubtless wish to emphasize requests have also been made of other powers including

                >Mikoyan</persName>’s visit might be postponed again because of Soviet
              dissatisfaction with the Chancellor’s speech raising the question of reductions in
              Austrian compensation shipments and because the Soviets considered that possible
              involvement of <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s visit in the Austrian
              Presidential campaign might make the trip undesirable.<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2"
                >Telegram 3351, March 19. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files,
                033.6163/3–1957)</note> However, the Austrians asked that <persName
                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> come as scheduled, apparently because
              Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> is determined to obtain
              alleviations in Austrian compensation shipments. The Embassy has long felt that
                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> wished to go down in history not only as
              the Chancellor who negotiated the Austrian State Treaty but also as the Chancellor who
              obtained considerable reduction in the burdens imposed by the Treaty. The Embassy also
              believes that <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> is convinced that the
              successful conclusion of the State Treaty is evidence that he can negotiate
              successfully with the Russians. In arranging the visit, the Soviets hinted that
              discussions of reductions in Austrian compensation shipments could only be discussed
              in Moscow and that Austria must first demonstrate greater adherence to its neutrality
              policy. The Soviets apparently indicated that such discussions should be held six
              months to a year from now.</p>
            <p>Soviet relations with Austria have deteriorated in recent weeks because of Minister
              of the Interior Helmer’s expulsion of the World Peace Council Secretariat in February
              and the award of a decoration to an Austrian gendarme who killed a Soviet soldier who
              crossed into Austria in pursuit of fleeing Hungarian refugees. Some Austrian leaders
              consider these actions needless provocations of the Soviets.</p>
            <p>The Embassy anticipates that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> will
              raise the banning of the World Peace Council Secretariat, the general deterioration of
              Austro-Soviet relations and Austrian actions during the Hungarian uprising. <persName
                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> might also offer a loan for reconstruction of
              former Soviet operated plants in Austria and modernization of the Vienna transport
              system, as he was reported ready to do last fall. The Austrians, for their part, are
              preparing their case for a request <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0077"/>for
              reduction in compensation shipments but are not hopeful that <persName
                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> will give them much satisfaction.</p>
            <p>On our part we have authorized the signature of agreements for a $15 million <gloss
                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title I program and a $10 million special Title II
              program for assistance to Hungarian refugees. The agreements can not be concluded
              before <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s visit as the Austrian Cabinet
              is in recess for Easter, but we have suggested the Embassy leak the news of the
              agreements to strengthen the Austrian position and offset the favorable propaganda
              which would result from any concessions which <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"

            <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
            <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> has written you a
              personal letter (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">None of the tabs has been found in

              Teuber which was vested by the Office of Alien Property (OAP). The property has been
              retained because the OAP has taken the position that return would not be in the
              “national interest” because Mr. <persName>Teuber</persName> once applied for
              membership in the Nazi Party, even though his application was not accepted and he was
              mentally incompetent at the time of his application, according to Austrian law.
              Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> is interested in the case because
              he was a personal friend of Mr. <persName>Teuber</persName>’s father, the founder of
              the Austrian Boy Scout movement.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Recommended U.S. Position:</hi></p>
            <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> should be informed that upon
              receipt of his letter concerning the property of Oskar Teuber the letter was referred
              to the Attorney General. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> discussed
              the matter with the Alien Property Custodian on September 22 and learned that the
              claim is still under consideration and may have to be referred to the Attorney General
              for decision. In any event, as the Minister is aware, an Austrian delegation is coming
              to Washington on October 5 to negotiate a treaty for the return of Austrian vested
              property which would include the Teuber property. The United States hopes that the
              treaty will be concluded and ratified at an early date.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Matters of Concern to the United
              States</hi></p>
            <p>From the United States point of view, there are two important problems in our
              relations with Austria: Austrian failure to comply with certain important provisions
              of the Vienna Memorandum and Austrian failure to settle certain categories of claims
              of former persecutees, as provided in Article 26 of the State Treaty.</p>
            <p>1.<hi rend="italic">Vienna Memorandum</hi> (Background Memorandum, Tab B)</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
            <p>Although Austria agreed to return the property of the British and the American oil
              companies within twenty-one months after the ratification of the State Treaty, that is
              by April 27, 1957, the Lobau refinery, the major refinery owned by the companies, and
              its pipelines have not yet been returned. The Austrian Government has also not settled
              claims based on former oil exploration rights in Eastern Austria. On August 27, the
              United States and UK Embassies delivered identical notes requesting prompt return of
              the Lobau refinery and settlement of other outstanding claims, and the Department
              undertook a number of representations urging full compliance with the terms of the
              Vienna Memorandum. Embassy Vienna cabled on September 19 that a proposal to return the
              Lobau refinery and pipelines will be brought before the Cabinet on September 24 but
              will not take effect until some time later. The oil companies which have long <pb
                n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0080"/>been deprived of their property are anxious to
              regain control of the refinery.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Recommended U.S. Position:</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary should express the concern which the United States Government has felt
              that Austria has not been able to comply with its obligations under the Vienna
              Memorandum within the specified twenty-one month period which expired on April 27,
              1957. The United States hopes that the Lobau refinery and the pipelines will soon be
              returned and that a settlement satisfactory to both parties will be achieved in the
              near future on the other outstanding claims of the oil companies.</p>
            <p>If, in reply, the Minister refers to the proposed Austrian Cabinet action, the
              Secretary should welcome the proposal and state that the United States relies on
              Austrian good faith in fulfilling its commitments under the Vienna Memorandum and
              expects that a satisfactory settlement on all points, including the exploration
              rights, will be achieved.</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Jewish Claims under Article 26</hi> (Background Memorandum, Tab
              C)</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Recommended U.S. Position:</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary should stress to Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName>
              and Minister Kamitz, who are both members of the Austrian Cabinet Committee
              established to consider claims of former Jewish persecutees in Austria, that
              individual claimants, Jewish organizations in the United States, and a number of
              Senators and Congressmen have been exerting great and increasing pressure on the
              Department to have Austria complete the settlement of claims under Article 26 of the
              State Treaty which provides for restoration of property, legal rights, and interests
              to the persecutees. The United States hopes that the Austrian Government will soon
              take some action either by settling individual claims for bank accounts, insurance
              policies, and other legal rights and interests or by establishing a fund of sufficient
              size to meet the bulk of the claims.</p>

            <p>The Austrian Embassy has stated that Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1"

              view of the limited <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 funds available and the many
              more critical requests pending, it is difficult to say anything definite now about
              Austria’s chances for a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program but they appear
              dim.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Recommended US. Position:</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary should state that the Austrian request has received careful
              consideration but that there are numerous requests for <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                >PL</gloss> 480 programs from countries whose economies are weak, that Austria’s
              economy is relatively strong, that it has already received three Title I programs
              totalling $43.3 million, and that we are unable at this time to make any definite

            <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
            <p>The Austrian Foreign Minister may refer to recent conversations with Ambassador
              Matthews and Secretary Weeks in Vienna regarding Austrian efforts to promote an
              association by Poland with the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and a grant of
              credits to Poland through the European Payments Union of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                >OEEC</gloss>.</p>
            <p>The Austrians expect this issue will be raised at the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                >OEEC</gloss> Ministerial Meeting of October 15, although it is not clear whether
              the question would be raised on Austrian initiative or by a group of <gloss
                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries. In the meantime, Austria has granted
              Poland a credit equivalent to $5 million. The Austrian Government considers an <gloss
                target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> credit, which would draw largely on German funds, would
              be an expression of Western European solidarity in support of Poland.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Recommended U.S. Position:</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary should state that our preliminary position is that we would favor
              efforts to bring Poland into a relationship with the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                >OEEC</gloss> as a means of strengthening Polish ties with Western Europe. As
              already indicated to Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> by Ambassador
              Matthews in Vienna, a relationship between Poland and the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                >OEEC</gloss> would presumably involve careful and balanced consideration by both
              the Poles and the member Governments of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.
              Association with <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and extension of an <gloss
                target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> credit to Poland would involve a number of technical
              and economic problems some of which would be similar to those which have arisen in
              connection with the question of Spanish and Yugoslav association with the <gloss
                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. If, however, a decision is taken on a high political

              that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> intended to visit Moscow in
              6 to 8 weeks to negotiate a reduction in Austria’s compensation shipments to the
              Soviet Union. (Telegram 343 to Moscow, 1032 to Vienna; Department of State, Central
              Files, 763.13/9–1857) The Embassy in Vienna replied that because the Chancellor was
              ill it was unlikely that the visit would take place before 1958. It also reported that
              the Austrians believed that the Soviets would grant them concessions without any
              conditions. The Embassy, however, believed the Soviets might expect Austria to
              reestablish good relations with Hungary in return for the concessions. (Telegram 841,
              September 20; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 763.13/9–2057) For the Embassy in Moscow’s

              expressed satisfaction with current implementation by Vienna of Austrian neutrality
              policy, it will be recalled that Soviet press published number of articles during this
              spring criticizing Austria’s interpretation of that policy and its position on
              Hungarian question, particularly refugees. While we are inclined to doubt Soviet
              Government in any event prepared grant significant reduction in Austrian compensation
              shipments to USSR, latter is not likely seek major Austrian quid pro quo since this
              would both negate desired political effect and run into opposition of Austrians who,
              after all, are presumably not desperately in need of Soviet reduction.</p>
            <p>Soviet asking points, in addition to urging general increase of Austrian-Soviet bloc
              trade, might involve attempt persuade Austrians (1) to recognize existence two
              Germanies and establish relations with East German regime, though we hardly believe
              Soviets will insist upon this; (2) to assume full membership in Soviet-dominated
              Danube Commission; (3) to adopt more “reasonable” attitude toward <pb n="55"
                xml:id="pg_55" facs="0083"/>Hungarian question and Kadar regime, including problem
              of refugees; (4) to support publicly Soviet position on banning weapons mass
              destruction and further nuclear tests; (5) to avoid membership in or close
              relationship with such “aggressive components of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
              >NATO</gloss>” as Coal-Steel Community, European Common Market and Free Trade Area,
              and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>; and (6) to so formulate Austria’s
              position on international issues that truer expression of “Austrian neutrality” will
              obtain than in past. Conceivable Soviets might also seek agreement to revive use
              Vienna as headquarters for worldwide Commie front organizations.</p>

            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> called at his request on Mr.
                <persName>Jandrey</persName> to inform him of developments on the South Tyrol
              question. The Ambassador referred to an article in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                Times</hi> of December 5 which stated that in a debate in the Austrian Parliament,
              Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> had indicated that if
              direct talks with Italian representatives did not result in acceptable progress on the
              South Tyrol question, it might be necessary as a last resort to bring the issue before
              the United Nations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> said he
              had received instructions to raise the South Tyrol question with the Department.
              Foreign Minister Pella<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">Giuseppe Pella, Italian Deputy Prime
                Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.</note> and Minister <persName
                corresp="#p_FL1">Figl</persName> had agreed in New York in September to conduct
              negotiations on South Tyrol following the Italian elections scheduled for the spring
              of 1958, but the situation had deteriorated since the agreement was reached.
              Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> said that an informal
              indication by the United States to the Italian Government that the problem should be
              resolved by direct talks would be useful.</p>
            <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0084"/>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Jandrey</persName> replied that he had had an opportunity to hear Dr.
                <persName>Gschnitzer</persName>’s<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Franz Gschnitzer,
                Austrian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the Office of the Federal
                Chancellor.</note> views on the South Tyrol question, when the latter was here in
              September. He had told Dr. <persName>Gschnitzer</persName> that the United States
              position was that the problem should be resolved by direct talks between Italy and
              Austria and that he did not see that there had been any significant change in the
              situation since then. He did not believe that raising the South Tyrol question in an
              international forum would contribute to the settlement of the problem and pointed out
              that it would only benefit the extremists on both sides.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gruber</persName> did not specifically request
              an informal approach to Foreign Minister Pella, and the Ambassador later indicated to
              Mr. <persName>Chapin</persName> that his instructions were not very precise. The
              Ambassador believed, however, that some informal indication of United States interest
              in a settlement of the South Tyrol question by Ambassador Zellerbach<note n="4"
                xml:id="d37fn4"><persName>James D. Zellerbach</persName>, Ambassador to

                  however, the danger that the appeal of reunification wiil, over a period of time,
                  become so strong in Germany as to give rise to temptation to discard the
                  associations with the West in an effort to advance reunification on terms which
                  would at best result in a neutral Germany and at worst in an Eastern-oriented
                  Germany. Our problem is to prevent this possibility arising. The best means of
                  doing this, in my judgment, is to so tie Germany into the whole complex of Western
                  institutions—military, political and economic—and to so command her loyalties that
                  neutrality or orientation to the East will be commonly accepted as unthinkable.

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName></hi>:
              After having resumed my official duties since some time, I should like to use an
              opportunity that offers itself to continue our exchange of views. These weeks of
              forced leisure gave <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0086"/>me time to study the
              situation quietly. Especially I have contemplated the 1st and the 2nd Geneva
                conference<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">For documentation on the two Geneva
                Conferences, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05">volume v</ref>.</note> and the steps
              which <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and Chruschtschow have
              undertaken thereafter in Asia, furthermore their abusive language against the free
              world, above all against England and the USA. In my opinion the 1st Geneva conference
              showed that the Soviets do not understand a reasonable and normal language and that
              they are inaccessible for objective considerations. They are and remain convinced that
              communism will rule the world and that they are and shall stay to be the leaders of
              communism. Insofar the 1st Geneva conference will have a good effect, if the free
              world is going to draw the necessary conclusions therefrom, as you have already said
              in a press interview.</p>
            <p>However one more thing seems to be necessary in my opinion: The free world or better
              said the masses in the free countries who influence public opinion strongly have no
              clear idea on communism and on what communism does to Russia and other countries. They
              know nothing about it and they live in a feeling of security that is wholly
              unjustified. In my opinion it is an essential task to inform our peoples on this: What
              communism teaches, what it does, what happened to the peoples whom it has subjugated
              and what would happen to those it would subjugate in the future. This of course cannot
              originate from the governments alone. There have to be found special ways—with the
              universities, by founding appropriate associations, with the political parties, the
              trade unions—.</p>
            <p>I believe that we cannot get out of this great danger for the free world without a
              great information campaign that is ideologically synchronized.</p>
            <p>You certainly know that I had and have still at present a dispute within the
              government coalition. I have brought about this clarification myself because I believe
              that it is—first of all—essential to dispel any doubt the Soviets might have about the
              determination of my government and of those who back it up to continue the policy I
              pursue. Even if in this process some should eliminate themselves who have given only
              halfhearted support to my policy I deem this concentration to be much better than the
              doubts and uncertainties provoked not only in the camp of our enemies but also with
              our friends by the attitude some people assumed in public. Besides one shall see that
              the fundamental [basis?] for the policy which I pursue will then be the more firm and
              also broad enough for the determined mastering of those tasks which are our share. I
              therefore look upon this development as a contribution to the strengthening of our
              side.</p>
            <p>The specific tasks of the Federal Republic are clear. We intend to set up those
              forces that we contribute to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance as
              rapidly <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0087"/>as possible, The taking over of the
              Federal Frontier Police that was recently decided will enable us to incorporate about
              18,000 trained men into the first divisions to be formed. It goes without saying that
              we shall replenish the Frontier Police thereafter.</p>
            <p>I should like to say here with great emphasis that—apart from the consideration of
              political aspects by which we want to make sure that our soldiers by their conviction
              are prepared to defend democracy and freedom—that in the formation of our forces only
              military and technical viewpoints shall be determining. Financial considerations shall
              under no circumstances inhibit or delay the carrying out of this program in any
              way.</p>
            <p>Parallel to this internal consolidation European cooperation should be strengthened.
              Also in this respect—I should like to say— my government is ready to cooperate to the
              utmost in all programs for European integration and that we shall participate in every
              measure be it for the creation of a common market or the atomic pool.</p>
            <p>I believe that the determination that manifests itself in the realization of this
              program shall not fail to impress the Soviets if one more premise is given that I have
              already mentioned:</p>
            <p>The determination of action must be matched by the resoluteness of the language and
              the firmness of the attitude towards the Soviets. It is evident that the Soviets
              interpreted the language used in the first Geneva conference as a signal of weakness
              of the West and specifically as a weakness of the will. I think it probable that they
              felt encouraged for their behaviour in the second Geneva Conference and for their
              performance in India by the impressions they got in the first Geneva conference. Our
              prisoners of war who returned from Russia have told me repeatedly that also in their
              camps the saying proved to be right: <gloss target="#t_WHO1">Who</gloss> approaches
              the Russian as servant shall be treated as servant, who comes as the “boss” is treated
              as the “boss”.</p>
            <p>I don’t think it very likely that we shall make considerable progress before the year
              1957. The Soviets in all probability intend to wait for the elections in the United
              States and the election for our Federal Parliament that will most probably take place
              in fall 1957. Nevertheless we shall have to demonstrate all the time our firmness and
              determination. We may not allow the problem of the unity of Germany to become
              quiescent in order not to let all Germans in the Soviet occupied zone and all
              satellite peoples lose their hope. I know that the Soviets hope for my elimination in
              the next two years because of my age. I do not intend to please the Soviets in this
              respect. I work for the formation of my party so that it shall win the campaign and
              election of 1957. My party would then with certainty continue to pursue my foreign
              policy also without me.</p>
            <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0088"/>
            <p>I wish to you and to Mrs. <persName>Dulles</persName> a blessed and merry Christmas.

                xml:id="d40fn3">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué,

                1047–1048.</note> As result of Geneva, question had now dropped to second rank. He
              wondered whether Secretary envisaged making fresh approach to Soviets. Secretary said
              did not think it would be useful to do so for next few months at least, in view of
              strong Soviet position at Geneva. Perhaps question should be reviewed in spring of
              next year.</p>
            <p>Brentano said Zorin would arrive in Bonn Monday or Tuesday. He was convinced that
              Zorin would begin discussion of reunification at early date. He assured Secretary we
              would be kept informed. In response to question by Secretary, Brentano said he thought
              Zorin might perhaps make new proposals. Hallstein thought Soviets would take
              initiative, but perhaps not so immediately. He thought Zorin would begin by
              exploration of situation, perhaps then make economic offers, and eventually raise
              reunification question. Secretary said he supposed Soviets would try to convey
              impression that there would be advantages to Germany in entering negotiations with
              USSR, but thought that Soviet position on maintenance of division of Germany was quite
              firm at this time. Brentano agreed, but pointed out that some sections of German
              opinion would probably eventually <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0089"/>exert
              pressures on government at least to listen to Soviet proposals. Secretary commented
              that if it became known in East Germany that Soviets were preparing to sell out <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, East German regime might demand assurances which might
              tend to offset such pressures.</p>
            <p>Brentano expressed concern over Berlin. He thought Soviets would use pressure on city
              as means of obtaining recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He thought
                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would place increasing obstacles on traffic and
              transport to Berlin. He suggested Soviets would attempt to influence German opinion by
              taking position that if Berlin were to be maintained Federal Republic would have to
              deal with Pankow, but this would be impossible to do. He welcomed inclusion in <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué of statement regarding joint consultation
              on Berlin problem and remarked that it might be necessary to think in near future of
              joint reaction by three powers and Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>Secretary said he understood some study was being made of economic relations between
              East Zone and Federal Republic and perhaps other Western States. He thought this very
              important line to follow. Federal Republic was strong while East Zone was weak and
              there should be areas in which Federal Republic could exert counter-measures against
              Eastern regime. Emphasized value of being prepared to take such measures and to
              letting this be known as deterrent. Said would probably require cooperation from other
              Western European countries. Hallstein said Federal Republic dependent to some degree
              on East Zone, particularly as regards brown coal. Question of counter-measures had
              been studied in connection with Autobahn toll problem. Economists had reported that
              Soviet Zone brown coal could not be replaced. He said that steel exports to Soviet
              Zone so small they cannot be used as means of pressure, and that stopping trade with
              East Zone would do more harm to Federal Republic than East Zone. He therefore
              emphasized need for concerted action. Secretary emphasized importance of study of
              possibility economic counter-measures. He said that if East Germans thought that
              Federal Republic depended on them, they would be encouraged take greater and greater
              liberties and suggested that Federal Republic should seek to find ways of becoming
              independent.</p>
            <p>Hallstein said <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> campaign for obtaining
              recognition, which has been going on for several years, is now reaching climax after
                Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreement.<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4"
                >Reference is to the agreements between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic
                Republic, signed at Moscow, September 20, 1955; see <ref target="#d218">Document
                  218</ref>.</note> While resistance heretofore had been successful, weak points
              were emerging. He noted that in vote on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> admission
              to <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>, India, Egypt and Yugoslavia had voted
              with USSR and Czechoslovakia for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> admission. He
              also mentioned granting of consular functions to East German trade mission by <pb
                n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0090"/>Egypt. He said that Federal Republic had
              threatened to break relations and appeared optimistic regarding Egyptian situation. He
              said that Federal Republic would be adamant in refusing to have relations with any
              government which recognized <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, remarking there was
              no room for compromise on this issue. He said that in this field too Germans would
              need advice and welcomed consultation in committee recently established in Bonn.
              Secretary agreed that only by taking strong and clear position on this matter could
              recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> be prevented. He pointed out that
              Federal Republic is stronger than <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that if
              other countries have to choose between two, they will choose Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>Secretary referred to discussion which had taken place with Schaeffer December 16 on
              support of visiting forces in Germany. He said he did not wish to discuss it. However,
              on basis of talks he had had with British and French, he thought Germans should
              recognize matter has political aspects and is not merely financial problem. Brentano
              said he had received detailed report on meeting from Schaeffer. Schaeffer was prepared
              to have negotiation under Article 4 of finance convention and thought early agreement
              could be reached. He said British proposals went quite far on both substance and form.
              While he agreed there were political aspects, he pointed out it was impossible for
              Federal Republic to diverge from agreements approved by Bundestag and policies which
              had been explained. Specifically, they could not justify to Bundestag reversion to
              system of occupation costs. He understood from Schaeffer that there was no great need
              for speed since there were adequate amounts for next year.</p>
            <p>Secretary pointed out that British are very sensitive on financial matters in view of
              narrow margin on which they live. When their reserves decline, they become very
              sensitive about various policies. Their financial difficulties affect all of their
              policies and contribute to their position on such matters as Common Market. Brentano
              said Schaeffer had informed him that he was prepared to deal with foreign exchange
              problem by increasing purchases of military equipment abroad and had mentioned figure
              of 2.5 billion.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Chancellor</hi>: I have received and have studied
              carefully your letter of December 12, 1955.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2"><ref
                  target="#d39">Document 39</ref>.</note> I share the conclusion to which you have
              come, as indeed does President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> with
              whom I have discussed your letter.</p>
            <p>I believe that the first Geneva Conference was not only inevitable, but good, in the
              sense that it was necessary to demonstrate to all the world the sincerity of our
              peaceful purposes. This was done in a way which none could misunderstand. The
              initiatives which President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> took at
              that first Conference were accepted by all the world as coming from a man and from a
              nation which entertained no aggressive purposes. However, as President <persName
                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said at that Conference, its value would
              depend largely upon what happened afterwards.</p>
            <p>I doubt, however, that subsequent events are due to any false impressions which these
              Soviet rulers got at the first Geneva Conference. While that Conference did make
              evident our desire for a just peace, there was plenty of emphasis upon justice and
              plenty of firmness. We now know that plans for opening the new front in the Near East
              were already under way even before the first Geneva Conference was held.</p>
            <p>The second Geneva Conference and the recent conduct of the Soviet rulers in Asia have
              shown the world that the sincerity of Western purpose, demonstrated at the first
              Geneva Conference, was not matched by any comparable sincerity on the part of the
              Soviet rulers. At the second Geneva Conference they flagrantly violated their
              agreement that Germany should be reunified by free elections. They went on in Asia to
              make speeches designed to stir up hatred as between peoples and nations. There has
              emerged a pattern sufficiently clear so that all the world can see it. In India they
              attempted to arouse popular passion against Portugal on account of Goa, and against
              Pakistan on account of Kashmir. In Burma they attempted to <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64"
                facs="0092"/>arouse popular emotions against Britain. In Afghanistan they attempted
              to arouse popular emotions against Pakistan on account of Pushtoonistan. They are
              trying to arouse the Arabs against Israel. In Cyprus they seek to arouse the Cypriots
              against Britain, and they are most recently trying to sow trouble between Italy and
              Britain by suggesting that the inhabitants of Malta are Italians.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Soviet rulers are exposed as having not only violated their formal
              agreements given at the first Geneva Conference, but they are violating the spirit of
              that Conference, and indeed, elemental standards of decency, by seeking wherever they
              can to create tension and to envenom the relations between free nations and peoples,
              in the hopes that they can gain therefrom.</p>
            <p>This is indeed a very evil purpose. However, it is so evil that it should be possible
              to have it react against them.</p>
            <p>So much for the Geneva Conferences.</p>
            <p>You say that those in free countries who influence public opinion, and particularly
              mass opinion, have no clear idea on Communism and what Communism does in Russia and
              elsewhere.</p>
            <p>That is, I am afraid, true of many countries, though happily it is not true here in
              the United States. Not only our political leadership, on a bipartisan basis, but also
              the religious leadership and the labor leadership of the country are well informed on
              the points you mention. The task is to bring a similar realization to other
              countries.</p>
            <p>There has been a reluctance in Europe to do this. Perhaps that is expressed by our
              proverb “Where ignorance is bliss, ’tis folly to be wise”. Also we have the simile of
              the ostrich who is supposed to gain a sense of security by burying his head in the
              sand so that he cannot see.</p>
            <p>I agree with you that we must find ways to deal with this. We are quite disposed to
              give practical consideration to your suggestion of a “great information campaign that
              is ideologically synchronized”. Perhaps as far as Europe is concerned, the Council of
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is the best common agency. Action taken at the
              last <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council meeting could and should lay the
              foundation for this. However, I doubt that it is practical to have any single agency
              for carrying on this campaign on behalf of the Western countries. There can be a
              common understanding as to the general line to be pursued, but I doubt that it is
              profitable to seek agreement as to detail or as to method which will probably have to
              be left to the individual countries.</p>
            <p>Our own labor leaders can, I think, be helpful. Also, I am taking on January 2 to
              some of our religious and civic leaders.</p>
            <p>There is another point which, in my opinion, should also be dealt with. That is to
              explain to our own peoples and to the peoples of the world the real principles which
              underlie our mutual security arrangements. The Soviet rulers constantly attack these
              as “military <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"/>blocs” created for aggressive
              purposes. We tend to be put on the defensive, although in fact what we are doing is to
              carry forward into the international field modern principles of security which are
              today practiced within every civilized nation. Except in the most primitive societies,
              security is no longer left to individual action. There is collective security, which
              largely functions through the creation of collective power to punish aggression. It
              acts as a deterrent. This is what the free nations are now seeking in the
              international field. It is the modern and enlightened way of gaining security as
              against vast aggressive despotisms represented by the Soviet bloc.</p>
            <p>Naturally the Soviet rulers would like to see the other nations weak through
              separateness. They do not like them gaining strength through collective measures.</p>
            <p>We should ourselves understand what it is we are doing, and explain it. I have tried
              to do so in this country, in many speeches which I have made. However, other Foreign
              Ministers do not seem to find it useful to popularize the sound and forward-looking
              principles which underlie our collective security systems. Neither do they contrast
              our defensive groupings with the Soviet system of annexing, either formally or in
              fact, other countries and other peoples; so that there is now a unified mass under
              centralized Communist direction consisting of approximately 900 million people and
              embracing what until recently were nearly a score of independent countries.</p>
            <p>The Soviet system destroys independence; ours preserves it.</p>
            <p>The President and I have noted with great interest what you say about your own
              political situation and particularly your idea with reference to your coalition. This
              is, of course, a matter where we do not feel competent to form any judgment.
              Certainly, however, I would agree with your general thesis that a smaller group that
              is cohesive is better than a larger group which is of uncertain purpose—subject, of
              course, to the qualification that under our parliamentary systems it is necessary to
              have a majority in order to have political power.</p>
            <p>We are glad to know your determined purpose to contribute military strength to the
              Atlantic alliance. This is important, not only from a purely military standpoint. It
              is important as a demonstration of national will, and it brings with it important
              byproducts in terms of increased unity and fellowship.</p>
            <p>We think it also important to move forward as rapidly as practical with programs for
              European integration. I am delighted to have your assurance that you will participate
              in every such measure, be it the future creation of a common market or the atomic
              pool. This evolution toward integration is, of course, a trend to which President
                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and I attach the utmost
              importance. I discussed this <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>somewhat with Dr.
                <persName>Von Brentano</persName> in Paris.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">See <gloss
                  target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 23, <ref target="#d40"><hi rend="italic"
                    >supra</hi></ref>.</note> No doubt the President will be discussing it next
              month with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d41fn4">Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> visited
                the United States, January 31–February 1, 1956. For documentation, see <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v27#pg_610">vol. XXVII, pp. 610</ref> ff.</note> I think you
              will find the United States is prepared to act sympathetically toward every sound
              proposal for the closer integration of Western Europe.</p>
            <p>At the same time we must not, as you say, allow the problem of the unity of Germany
              to become quiescent. I am wondering whether there are not certain types of “contacts”
              which you could urge along the lines of those which we urged at our second Geneva
              Conference.</p>
            <p>No doubt these would be rejected by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but the
              proposals and their rejection would not be without political consequences.</p>
            <p>After all, the Federal Republic is a great and powerful force and a tremendous magnet
              of attraction, as evidenced by the steady flow of Germans from the East to the West. I
              believe it is possible to do more than is now being done to create conditions in East
              Germany so that the Soviet rulers will feel that to attempt to hold this area involves
              more liabilities than assets. I wonder whether ways might perhaps be found by which
              the East Germans could indicate through passive resistance, slowdowns, and the like,
              that they are predominantly responsive to the political policies of the Federal
              Republic. This is, of course, a delicate matter. But we already know that the Soviet
              rulers and their satellites in East Germany are gravely concerned at the lack of
              loyalty to them on the part of the East Germans, and perhaps evidence of this could be
              multiplied without precipitating violence which could liquidate the most loyal
              elements.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, let me say that the most cheering note in your letter is your
              statement that you do not intend to please the Soviets by dropping out of the picture
              in the next two years. The task ahead needs your presence and powerful personality to

              <item><p>Mr. <persName>Conant</persName> submitted his views on these problems in a
                  despatch we have just received (Bonn’s 1337).<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">Not
                    printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 762A.5/12–2955)</note> He discusses
                  German intentions and the progress of their efforts along much the same lines I
                  reported to you on my return from Germany. He says that the Chancellor is
                  principally concerned with making a political demonstration of Germany’s
                  allegiance to the West. He thinks the Chancellor can be expected to demand steady
                  progress but not to compel (if he could) his Government and Parliament to take the
                  measures which would be necessary to complete the buildup within three to four
                  years. He says the Economic and Finance Ministries are particularly concerned to
                  protect their policies and position and the Defense Ministry is not well organized
                  or particularly aggressive. Finally, he points out that the insistence of the
                  Parliament and people that the creation of armed forces be given a secure basis in
                  German society and law delays the buildup. He believes the buildup will be
                  stretched out well beyond a three to four year period unless there is a dramatic
                  outside event such as intensification of the cold war or an indication of intense
                  United States interest in a rapid buildup demonstrated by an offer of a very
                  substantial amount of additional military assistance.</p>
                <p>Mr. <persName>Conant</persName> believes that anything less then a very
                  substantial amount of additional military assistance could not be relied on to
                  insure the realization of a rapid buildup. He thinks, however, that failure to
                  grant a small amount of additional assistance would be interpreted by the Germans
                  to mean that the United States no longer regards a rapid buildup particularly
                  important. He suggests that the United States should take the position that we
                  could not consider additional aid until we have a clear expression of German
                  intentions to increase their budgetary provisions for the second and third years
                  of the buildup and take the legal, technical, economic and financial action
                  required to achieve a three to four year buildup. However, he believes we may have
                  to grant some additional aid on political grounds if it appears to be in our
                  interest to do so. If we do so we <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>should
                  obtain as much in the way of firm commitments from the Germans as possible. Mr.
                    <persName>Conant</persName> says finally that if we use military assistance to
                  get additional support costs, we cannot expect this to accomplish anything of
                  significance in regard to the speed of the buildup.</p></item>
              <label>II.</label>
              <item>I suggest you give Mr. <persName>Conant</persName> a brief summary of the
                thinking within the Administration on military assistance generally and assistance
                to Germany in particular. This might serve as a preface to telling him about your
                agreement with <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> that we should study the
                whole series of problems involved in the German buildup and United states military
                assistance to Germany, testing all of the past assumptions which have been the basis
                of our thinking and attempting to arrive at a comprehensive statement of what we
                hope will be achieved in Germany and how best we can contribute to reaching our
                objectives. I think you might mention the following points as indicative of the type
                of problem we think requires much more thought than has yet been given to it: <list>
                  <label>A.</label>
                  <item>The key position that conscription will play in the timing of the German
                    buildup and the question of whether the German Government should be held to its
                    statements that it will pass a conscription law before the 1957
                    elections.</item>
                  <label>B.</label>
                  <item>The possibility of inflationary developments if a rapid buildup is
                    attempted. I believe the Embassy has discounted this possibility too much and
                    that inflation could be a serious threat to political stability in Germany if
                    too much were attempted too soon.</item>
                  <label>C.</label>
                  <item>The type of equipment the German Forces should have when they are ready
                    three or four years hence. I do not think present planning takes nearly adequate
                    account of newer models of conventional weapons or some of the new
                    weapons.</item>
                  <label>D.</label>
                  <item>The essential place which comprehensive information on German equipment
                    requirements, in detail, has in determining United States aid policy and
                    programs. Exploitation of possibilities of procurement by the Germans in Europe
                    and the programming of United States production for the Germans (regardless of
                    whether it is given or sold) cannot get forward except on the basis of detailed
                    plans. The Embassy’s views on the broader aspects of the problem as, for
                    example, in the despatch summarized above, cannot be fully utilized here in
                    Washington without this kind of basic spade work, which we do not yet have.<note

              activities in nuclear science in that region. He points out that in some of these

              the community development. I agreed with him.</p>

            <p>Ambassador Conant and I called upon Foreign Minister Brentano at 4:30 p.m. on
              February 3. There were present Foreign Minister Von Brentano, Counselor von Lilienfeld
              and Ministerial Director von Welcke.</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>After introductory pleasantries, the Foreign Minister stated that his Government
                believed it would be most dangerous to undertake any further Four Power talks at the
                present time. He thought that it might lead into a number of undesirable results,
                among them being the necessity for the Federal Republic to enter into direct
                negotiations or relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Ambassador
                Conant and I agreed, and I stated that it was most certainly not our intention to
                undertake any line of action which would lead to such conversations, at least until
                we could be assured of constructive results. The Foreign Minister expressed
                agreement and satisfaction at our position.</item>

                    1956, pp. 515–518, and March 26, 1956, pp. 191–195.</note> The Foreign Minister
                  expressed <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>great satisfaction on behalf of
                  his Government at the rapidity and effectiveness with which the President’s reply
                  had been forthcoming. I stated the President’s great appreciation for the
                  Chancellor’s message of appreciation and confidence. I showed him a preliminary
                  copy of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s latest message. He hoped
                  that we would hit back as soon as possible, for there were many obvious openings
                  which could be turned to our advantage.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Minister made an assessment of the reasons behind the Russian
                  initiative in the exchange of notes, saying that he believed they were caused by
                  (a) desire for propaganda, and (b) an attempt to take the offensive in protecting
                  their position in East Germany by forcing the discussion. I replied in agreement,
                  adding that the Russians found themselves in an incompatible position because of
                  their desire to appear in a position of peace and goodwill, on the one hand, while
                  continuing to assert domination over East Germany and the satellites on the other.
                  They were getting into an increasingly embarrassing situation by trying to
                  maintain both of these postures at the same time. We should not let them get away
                  with it.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Minister believed that the West should take the offensive as soon as
                  possible and should not be dependent, for action, upon the reaction of the
                  Russians. For example, he believed that some Western initiative might be displayed
                  under Article 2 of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Treaty,<note n="3"
                    xml:id="d44fn3">Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty states, in part, that the
                    parties would contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly
                    international relations by strengthening their free institutions, by bringing
                    about a better understanding of the principles on which these institutions were
                    founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being.</note> and he
                  thought we should jointly explore this possibility. I said that we would give this
                  full consideration and, along the same line, we were looking into the possibility
                  of some sort of initiative through appropriate action in the UN Assembly. We
                  agreed we would explore other lines of action and keep each other
                advised.</p></item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Foreign Minister was of the opinion that the economic potential of the West,
                which was many times that of the orbit, should be mobilized for the purpose of
                bringing full pressure on the Soviets wherever opportunity existed. I agreed, but
                pointed out the inherent difficulties of organizing the free enterprise democracies,
                as against the concerted action that was possible on the part of totalitarian
                governments. I cited as an example the case of Communist China. While that country
                might appear to be far removed from the European scene, nevertheless it was of very
                direct interest to the United States because of our common borders on the Pacific
                Ocean. We had great concern about building up the economy of Communist China, and we
                hoped that the countries of Europe would realize that our policies in the Far East
                were dictated by very vital strategic necessities. I likened <pb n="71"
                  xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>it to the problems which the Federal Republic had in
                consideration of its relations with East Germany. We hoped that we might have the
                support of the Federal Republic in protecting our position in the Pacific. He
                expressed full understanding of our situation and promised to do whatever would be
                possible on the part of his country.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>We next turned to the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> talks, and the
                Foreign Minister expressed great satisfaction at the statements made in the
                declaration of Washington and the communiqué.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">For text of
                  the joint declaration and communiqué, dated February 1, see Department of State

                him of the general attitude of the United Kingdom, where they stressed the
                importance of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                  >OEEC</gloss> as vehicles toward carrying forward economic co-operation on the
                European continent. I outlined the strong position taken by Secretary <persName
                  corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, and especially by the President, in setting
                forth our attitude that, while these organizations would be helpful, we did not
                believe they would in any way take the place of closer integration of the six
                countries who were most directly concerned in such projects as <gloss
                  target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. I said that I was certain we had made our
                position clear to the UK and we intended to give every possible support to
                integration along the latter lines. He expressed appreciation and hoped that the
                talks would be helpful in bringing about more effective action.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item><p>We then turned to the Middle East, and I outlined in a general way our
                  discussions with the UK during the conference. We had agreed that no effort should
                  be spared to bring about an early solution to the Arab-Israel problem. As he was
                  well aware, this was fraught with many difficulties; nevertheless, we were doing
                  our utmost to work out some sort of a solution.</p>
                <p>With regard to the Buraimi situation, we were using our good offices to bring the
                  British and the Saudis into direct contact for an early end of their argument.</p>
                <p>We were both greatly concerned with the concerted Russian offensive in the Middle
                  East within the last few months. There had been aggressive efforts to augment
                  diplomatic, cultural, economic and military missions in many of the Arab
                  countries. They were having considerable success in this effort, notwithstanding
                  the risks that they were taking. We believed this offensive threatened the Western
                  position in the area. The Foreign Minister expressed agreement in this
                  apprehension and said that they were also aware of the Soviet effort. He expressed
                  the hope that German efforts might be coordinated with action of the UK and the US
                  in countering the threat from the bloc. He did not have any specific suggestions,
                  however, on how this could be brought about.</p></item>

              <item><p>The Foreign Minister outlined the intensive efforts being made by the Russian
                  Ambassador and his staff to embarrass the Federal Republic. While he did not
                  believe they had been very clever in their behavior, nevertheless they were active
                  in trying to undermine the position of his government. A steady stream of
                  high-level delegations were coming to West Germany, particularly in the industrial
                  field, in an endeavor to foster economic interchange. Industrialists were being
                  tempted with offers of orders for industrial goods on condition that an economic
                  treaty would be entered into between their two countries. The success of this
                  operation was problematical. It nevertheless caused his government a considerable
                  amount of concern and embarrassment.</p>
                <p>He then read us a note which he was sending to the Russian Ambassador warning him
                  of his criticisms of the Bonn Government, and of interference on the part of
                  himself and his staff in local affairs. The Foreign Minister was not sanguine of
                  effectively countering their activities, nevertheless he thought that such a note
                  was timely and would have the effect of putting them on record. I asked him if
                  they had considered restricting the movements of Russian personnel. He replied
                  that this would not be possible until their own ambassador had become installed in
                  Moscow, about February 25, and they were able to ascertain the restrictions that
                  might be put on his movements. It would then be possible to place reciprocal
                  restrictions on the movement of the Soviet officials in West Germany.</p></item>

            <p>The Ambassador and I called on Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> at 1:00 p.m. on February 4. The Chancellor was accompanied by
              Mr. <persName>von Lilienfeld</persName> and an interpreter.</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item><p>I set forth to the Chancellor briefly some thoughts which we have had
                  recently along the general lines that during the last six months the Russians
                  appear to be feeling considerably more confidence in themselves; that this
                  confidence appeared to be the result of their advances in economic, political and
                  military developments. Whether or not this confidence was justified was not the
                  question at point. It was simply that they were feeling it, and one noticeable
                  manifestation was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s “cockiness”,
                  especially during his trips abroad. I said I personally felt there was some danger
                  of the Russians miscalculating under these circumstances and we believe we should
                  be on the watch-out.</p>
                <p>The Chancellor said that he did not agree with the thesis that the Russians had
                  any right to confidence at this time; that they were being strained by their
                  efforts to fulfill the social obligations to their people and simultaneously carry
                  on an armaments build-up. He felt further that Red China was placing considerable
                  strain on Russia in its desire for industrialization and its rapid increase in
                  population. The Chancellor appeared to base his statements largely on what
                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said to him at Moscow
                  during his recent visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2"><persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                      >Adenauer</persName> visited Moscow in September 1956.</note> He also said
                  that he was convinced that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had a
                  realistic view of the situation. He mentioned further that <persName
                    corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed great fear of the United
                  States and also some fear of Germany, but none of France or Italy, and that the
                  United Kingdom was not mentioned. While the Chancellor did not comment on the
                  danger of <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0102"/>Soviet miscalculations, I noticed
                  that he nodded his head affirmatively on this point while I was speaking.</p>
                <p>The Chancellor commented that the Russians were unable to understand the good
                  treatment which they received at the first Geneva Conference. Especially, they
                  could not comprehend our apparent forgiveness for their “sins” or that we “treated
                  them as a prodigal son.” <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> boasted
                  openly of his letters from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                    >Eisenhower</persName> and felt that they were a great feather in his cap.</p>
                <p>He said that, in addition to their misunderstanding at Geneva, the confidence of
                  the Russians had been strengthened by the following three factors: (a) the recent
                  French elections; (b) the uncertainty as to whether
                    <persName>Eisenhower</persName> would be a candidate again which, if he would
                  not, would mean a new administration in the US Government; and (c) the 1957 German
                  elections, which the Russians might believe would bring the <gloss
                    target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> into power. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
                  was a neutrality party, so the Chancellor said, and though he insisted the <gloss
                    target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> would not come into power, he said that if he were
                  Russian he might well think that they would have a chance.</p></item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>He then turned to the question of the Middle East. I outlined to him in a
                general way the results of the recent conference between the US and the UK and
                stated that we believe that, within the last few weeks particularly, there had been
                a concerted move by the Russians into this area. It took the form of increased size
                and activity in their missions, the arming of Egypt and other Arab states, and the
                taking of diplomatic, political and subversive risks to an extent not previously
                undertaken. I expressed the opinion that this was the result of the increased
                confidence they appeared to feel in themselves within the last year. The Chancellor
                fully agreed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>He expressed the opinion that the Russian sense of confidence was as much due to the
              mistakes of the West as it was to increases in their own strength. He mentioned
              difficulties experienced by the US, UK and France in handling problems in Turkey,
              North Africa, and elsewhere in the area. He stated emphatically that we must adopt a
              close and uniform policy of firmness towards the Russians, and he was particularly
              pleased, as an indication of such a policy, by the President’s rapid reply to
                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> in the recent exchange of notes. He
              felt that our policies must be thoroughly coordinated and united, and expressed a
              desire to participate in any combined planning that might be developed. He said the
              West must be strong, otherwise we stood the chance of losing the cold war through our
              weakness, not through the strength of the Soviets. He said the US must use <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as an instrument of strength. I expressed the opinion
              that we must move from the defensive to the offensive in meeting the Soviet threat,
              and he nodded emphatic agreement.</p>
            <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0103"/>
            <p>I expressed the possibility of our taking the offensive in regard to the present
              Russian position in East Germany. They were endeavoring to appear before the world in
              a posture of peace and goodwill, while at the same time their actions in East Germany
              and the other satellite countries were utterly incompatible with such a position. I
              felt that we should keep a continuous offensive campaign going with regard to the
              Communist domination of East Germany. The Chancellor indicated his entire
              agreement.</p>
            <p>Returning to the Middle East, the Chancellor said that the UK had not wanted to do
              many things in the Middle East, such as pulling out of Suez, Egypt, Sudan; and he said
              that they were going to have to leave Cyprus. He thought they could do a better job of
              these retreats by making them earlier, and taking what advantage might be
              possible.</p>
            <p>He then shifted to the question of the relations with the Arab world. He said that
              the Germans were greatly respected by the Arabs for a number of reasons, therefore the
              Germans might be in a position to be of assistance in combating the Russian influence.
              He spoke of the possibility which was being discussed with German bankers of increased
              German credit facilities for development in the Arab countries. He said, however, the
              Germans lacked the capital. They needed this capital from the United States but it
              would have to be provided “secretly”; otherwise, the political advantage would be
              lost. But he made it plain that he had in mind not US Government money but private US
              money. I replied that we would certainly investigate the possibilities of such a
              program but that it would have many difficulties in fulfillment.</p>
            <p>He expressed the thought that if we could combat the Russian influence in the Arab
              world, the Arabs would start falling out among themselves and our own position would
              thereby be greatly strengthened.</p>
            <p>I gave the Chancellor, as an aide-mémoire, a translation of the President’s message
              which he had asked me to deliver orally.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">See <ref

              expressed great appreciation and requested me to extend his best wishes to the
              President.</p>
            <p>The conference lasted approximately one hour and a half. The Chancellor appeared to
              be in excellent health and thoroughly alert mentally.</p>

            </list>
            <p>In a conversation with the Under Secretary after dinner at the Ambassador’s
              residence, Dr. <persName>Schaeffer</persName> smilingly alluded to his difficulties as
              Finance Minister, saying he was under attack from all sides regarding the disposition
              of a budgetary surplus that did not actually exist. He explained in detail that the
              apparent surplus was merely funds which were already fully-obligated, including funds
              for the military build-up and a carry-over of occupation costs, and which would soon
              begin to be expended at an increasing rate.</p>
            <p>There followed a discussion of German tax policies, with the Minister pointing out
              that the tax burden on German industry was roughly equivalent to that in the United
              States. The Finance Minister indicated that he saw no chance for the near future of
              German taxes being reduced.</p>
            <p>At this point, Staatssekretär Westrick joined the discussion as did Ambassador Conant
              and the Foreign Minister, and the conversation turned to the problem of the increasing
              fuel requirements of German industry. The Under Secretary remarked that, perhaps
              because of his background, he wondered if the answer might not lie in the increased
              utilization of oil. Dr. <persName>Westrick</persName> admitted that there were
              possibilities in this direction, and commented that it might be wholesome for the
              German coal industry to have to meet competition from this field. A general discussion
              of the possibilities of German trade with the Arab states ensued, with Minister
              Schaeffer referring also to the purchases of oil from the British for Israel, for
              which Germany was paying under its indemnification agreement with the latter country,
              and which could be diverted to the Federal Republic after the agreement was concluded.
              It was agreed that German purchases of oil from the Arab states would undoubtedly
              result in increased German exports to those countries.</p>
            <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0105"/>
            <p>At one point in the conversation, the Under Secretary referred to the vast oil
              resources of the Middle East which remained undeveloped, and suggested the possibility
              that Germany might want to consider the possibilities in this field also. Dr.
                <persName>Westrick</persName> said the advantages of German enterprise in joining in
              the development of these resources were attractive, but that the lack of German
              capital was a great difficulty. He added that even if capital were available, the coal
              industry in Germany could put up a strong argument that if these funds were made
              available to it for investment, the industry could guarantee to meet Germany’s fuel
              requirements for many years to come out of the tremendous coal reserves which Germany
              still possesses.</p>
            <p>In his conversation with Dr. <persName>Schaeffer</persName>, the Under Secretary said
              he hoped the Finance Minister would find it possible to visit Washington again before
              too long. Dr. <persName>Schaeffer</persName> said he would like to come, and the Under
              Secretary suggested that perhaps the autumn of this year might be a good time,
              although it was perhaps too early yet to consider fixing a date. Dr.
                <persName>Schaeffer</persName> agreed, and the Under Secretary said we would

            <p>On March 22, at the 280th meeting of the National Security Council, Under Secretary
                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> raised the matter of Germany during a
              discussion of United States policy toward the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. The
              memorandum of discussion reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> offered the opinion that
                  there was one course of action at least in this area that the United States might
                  pursue more actively. He referred to his February visit to Berlin, and said that
                  90% of the East Germans would vote now for union with a free Germany. Accordingly,
                  the United States should publicize what the Soviets have been guilty of doing in
                  East Germany. It was a very weak spot in their armor.</p>
                <p>“The President expressed the opinion that we should make West Berlin a ‘showcase
                  of prosperity’, especially in terms of sending food, of which we have such a
                  tremendous over-abundance. Let’s send them pork, beef, wheat, and rice—millions of
                  dollars worth of it.</p>

                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> informed the President
                  that he had investigated this matter when he had been in Berlin. He had found the
                  West Berliners very well fed and clothed. Moreover, they were proud that their
                  situation had been achieved by their own efforts and exertions. West Berlin was

            <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>West Germany’s remarkable recovery has promoted the stability of moderate
                political forces and a strongly pro-Western orientation. The prospects are favorable
                for continued West German economic expansion, though at a declining rate. However,
                the West German economy remains particularly vulnerable to a deterioration of world
                trading conditions. A prolonged and widespread economic depression could seriously
                disrupt West Germany’s internal politics <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0107"/>and
                foreign policies. However, West Germans are becoming more self-assertive on national
                issues. There is a growing trend toward the belief that West German interests are no
                longer entirely identical with those of the Western powers, and that Bonn must
                develop a more independent foreign policy and greater initiative on reunification.
                Thus, the moderate political coalition led by Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName> is coming under increasing challenge from those who feel that
                his foreign policy is too rigidly tied to Western policies and who resent his
                largely autocratic control. The Chancellor faces serious opposition for the first
                time from the right, as well as continuing opposition from the left. (Paras. 16,
                21–22, 26, 29–32)</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>It is almost certain, however, that the present government will continue until
                the 1957 federal elections. Even <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s
                death or retirement before the elections almost certainly would not jeopardize West
                Germany’s basic pro-Western orientation and internal stability. (Paras.
                33–34)</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Rearmament is no longer challenged in principle by West German political
                leaders. However, Finance Minister Schaeffer’s determination not to raise budgetary
                outlays to the level required by the scheduled three to four year build-up,
                continuing controversy over the character of the armed forces, and possible failure
                to conscript until after the 1957 elections will further delay implementation of
                planned rearmament. (Paras. 49–50)</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Whether or not <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> leads the
                Christian Democratic Party in the 1957 elections it will probably remain the
                strongest single party in West Germany, although it is unlikely to retain a majority
                in the Bundestag. If the present coalition group receives a parliamentary majority,
                the coalition will almost certainly be continued. It seems more likely that the
                coalition parties will fall short of a majority, particularly if they are deprived
                of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s personal leadership. In this
                event, a <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, a
                  <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>, or an
                  <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> coalition,
                or a <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> minority government, are all possibilities.
                Although it is too early to predict what government would take office, increased
                adjustment and compromise would be required if strong and stable government were to
                continue. (Paras. 45–47)</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>It is highly unlikely that West Germany will abandon its membership in <gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or its intimate association with the United States,
                so long as the present government is in power. Even if those who favor a more
                independent foreign policy should come to power in Bonn, the strong economic and
                cultural ties with the West and, above all, the intense fear and distrust of the
                USSR would deter them from abandoning Bonn’s commitments to the West, except as part
                of an otherwise satisfactory reunification arrangement. (Para. 52)</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Bonn’s present policy of firm association with the North Atlantic Community will
                not prevent it from exploring reunification <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0108"
                />possibilities directly with the USSR, or even eventually with the East Germans.
                This tendency would increase if the West Germans became convinced that Western
                support on reunification were faltering. The West German government, whatever its
                political complexion, will probably find it politically necessary to engage in such
                discussions during the next few years. We believe it unlikely, however, that they
                would do so without keeping their major Western allies informed. We believe that no
                West German government would accept reunification unless, at a minimum: (a) Soviet
                forces were withdrawn from East Germany; (b) Germany were permitted an adequate
                defense force; and (c) the government felt assured that the US would continue to
                support and protect a united Germany. If the foregoing conditions were met, we
                believe that any West German government would accept such conditions as: (a) the
                neutrality of a reunified Germany; (b) a substantial modification of Western
                proposals for the conduct of elections; and (c) preservation for a limited period of
                the structure of the East German state within the framework of an all-German
                government, provided the West Germans were assured of control. (Paras. 55–56)</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>The long-range outlook for West German political stability and association with
                the West includes both favorable and adverse factors, which make the long term
                future of moderate and pro-Western government uncertain. On balance, we believe
                that, at least for some years to come, the political forces which will control West
                Germany will remain basically moderate, and that, except in the event of an
                acceptable Soviet reunification offer, West Germany will adhere to the Western
                alliance. (Paras. 58–61)</item>

              <item>Presiding over West Germany’s economic recovery and political alignment with the
                North Atlantic Community has been a center-right coalition led by the Christian
                Democratic Union (<gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>) and its Bavarian affiliate,
                the Christian Social Union (<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>). Although the 1953
                parliamentary elections gave the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss
                  target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> a majority of one in the Bundestag, Chancellor
                  <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> retained a coalition government
                which included the Free Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>), the
                Germany Party (<gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>), and the refugee All-German Bloc
                Party (<gloss target="#t_BHE1">BHE</gloss>). This coalition commanded a two-thirds
                majority (334 of 487 seats). However, this coalition developed strains as a result
                of Free <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0109"/>Democratic and all-German Bloc
                attacks on the Chancellor’s “authoritarianism” and his rigid adherence to Western
                policies. Eighteen <gloss target="#t_BHE1">BHE</gloss> deputies left the coalition
                in the summer of 1955, while seven other deputies, including two cabinet members,
                joined the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, and two others joined the <gloss
                  target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>. The right wing of the <gloss target="#t_FDP1"
                  >FDP</gloss> also became increasingly disaffected and in February 1956 its
                harassing actions culminated in breaking the <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                  >CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> coalition in the important German
                state of North-Rhine-Westphalia and in the formation of a coalition with the <gloss
                  target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. The Chancellor expelled from the coalition those 34
                  <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> members of the Bundestag who supported the

                believe <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s foreign policy is too
                rigidly tied to Western policy, and (b) they resent his personal domination of the
                government. As of the moment their collaboration has been limited to various State
                governments, but they may be able to overthrow <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                >CDU</gloss>-led governments in enough States to deprive <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName> of a majority in the Bundesrat at Bonn. In such an event

              <item>Nevertheless, it is almost certain that a <gloss target="#t_CDU1"

                part through US aid and in part from the application of unused occupation cost
                balances. The government is encouraged in its attitude by the complacency stimulated
                by the Summit Conference, by a general reluctance to accept the personal sacrifices
                involved in rearmament, and by political pressures for tax reductions. The
                government’s budgetary position is probably based to a considerable extent upon the
                belief that the US will eventually agree to make up the deficit, and it may be

                Nevertheless, West German industrialists are developing considerable hopes and
                expectations over the possibilities of lucrative trade not only with the Middle East
                and South Asia but also with Communist China, and to a lesser extent, with the other
                Bloc countries. In the past Bonn has in general been cooperative with respect to the
                strategic trade control program, although it has always tended toward a more lenient
                application of these controls in the case of East Germany. However, the apparent
                interest of the Soviet Bloc in expanding East-West trade, and the mounting
                opposition to controls in Western Europe has now convinced many industrialists and
                traders that a further weakening of the control system is inevitable. While the
                West: German government is unlikely to take the initiative in pressing for a further
                relaxation of controls, it will probably follow the British and French leads in this
                field. The government would probably be unable to resist pressures for establishing
                broader trade relations with the bloc if the Communist countries should make
                attractive trade offers, or if free world demand for German exports should
                decline.</item>

              <item><hi rend="italic">Reunification.</hi> Bonn’s present policy of firm association
                with the North Atlantic Community will not prevent it from exploring reunification
                possibilities directly with the USSR, or even eventually with the East Germans. This
                tendency would increase if the West Germans became convinced that Western support on
                reunification were faltering. In any event, the West German government, whatever its
                political complexion, will probably find it politically necessary to engage in such
                discussions during the next few years. We believe it unlikely, however, that they
                would do so without keeping their major Western allies informed.</item>
              <label>56.</label>
              <item>In conducting such discussions we believe that no West German government would
                accept reunification unless, at a minimum: (a) Soviet forces were withdrawn from
                East Germany; (b) Germany were permitted an adequate defense force; and (c) the
                government felt assured that the US would continue to support and protect a united
                Germany. If the foregoing conditions were met, we believe that any West German
                government would accept such conditions as: <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0116"
                />(a) the neutrality of a reunified Germany; (b) a substantial modification of
                Western proposals for the conduct of elections; and (c) preservation for a limited
                period of the structure of the East German state within the framework of an
                all-German government, provided the West Germans were assured of control. No German
                politician in or outside the governing coalition believes the USSR is currently
                prepared to meet these terms. Opposition to the present government’s reunification
                policy is based upon political expediency and upon the hope that the Soviet position
                might change if direct discussions were opened and if the West German position were
                less rigid than at present.</item>

              <item><hi rend="italic">East Germany.</hi> The West German government will face
                increasing demands for expanded contacts with the population and government of the
                East Zone, originating not only from the opposition but from virtually all segments
                of West German society. Because of political and economic necessity and cultural
                affinity, the West German government will reluctantly agree to a progressively wider
                range of contacts, perhaps including eventually contacts on the ministerial level.
                The question of de jure recognition will probably not be posed unless the East
                German regime should force the issue by applying severe economic restrictions on
                West Berlin, in which case the West German government would almost cetainly refuse
                to be intimidated.</item>

              <item>The long-range outlook for West German political stability and association with
                the West includes both favorable and adverse factors. On balance, we believe that,
                at least for some years to come, the political forces which will control West
                Germany will remain basically moderate, and that, except in the event of an
                acceptable Soviet reunification offer, West Germany will adhere to the Western
                alliance. Constitutional government has strong supporters and seems to have firmly
                established itself in the Federal Republic. The present West German indifference to
                extremist appeals, and the moderation of traditional cultural and class conflicts
                suggest that compromises on basic social and economic issues will probably continue
                to be reached, and that extremists will probably remain a relatively isolated
                minority. Military adventurism is unlikely to become a critical factor in West
                German policy during this longer period. As long as the polarization of global
                military strengths continues, West Germany will almost certainly refrain from
                independent military ventures.</item>
              <label>59.</label>
              <item>The present pattern of Bonn’s foreign policy indicates that the West Germans are
                seeking to establish themselves as co-equal with the “Big Three” Western Powers and
                will therefore tend to move cautiously in relations with their allies. Moreover, the
                West <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0117"/>will retain great assets in the West
                Germany’s powerful fear and distrust of the USSR, its cultural affinity for the
                West, and its recognition of the value of Western, and especially US, power.</item>
              <label>60.</label>
              <item>On the other hand, some factors make the long-term future of democratic and
                pro-Western government in West Germany uncertain. The passing of <persName
                  corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> will remove a strong stabilizing influence in
                West Germany. Democratic traditions are not deeply rooted in West Germany and
                authoritarian tendencies have not been eliminated. There is some danger that any of
                the established parties may become dominated by undemocratic leaders with narrow
                nationalist concepts. This danger would become serious in the event of protracted
                economic strains, prolonged governmental instability, or a substantial decline in
                the relative world power position of West Germany’s present allies. Moreover, if
                West German constitutional processes and association with the West should come under
                serious challenge, the German military establishment might again assert itself as a
                factor of political importance.</item>
              <label>61.</label>
              <item>West Germany’s increased sense of national self-assurance, its emergence as the
                leading power in continental Western Europe, the growth of its international
                influence, and the fact that its national interests are no longer completely
                identical with those of its allies will probably in time cause frictions between the
                Federal Republic and its Free World neighbors. These frictions in turn may increase
                mutual suspicions and animosities between the West Germans and other Western
                European peoples. Moreover, with Soviet policy entering a new phase and the era of
                  <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s leadership nearing an end,
                controversy over West Germany’s Western alignment will increase. New political
                leaders are emerging and the reunification issue will loom larger on the horizon. A
                continuation of the new flexibility in Soviet policy and of the reduction of
                tensions in Europe will encourage West German hopes that Soviet policy toward German
                reunification might change. Under these circumstances, the present policy of rigid
                alignment with the West would almost certainly be more seriously challenged by
                nationalist and neutralist elements in West Germany.</item>

            <p>The German Ambassador, having returned from Bonn early in the day, called on the
              Secretary at 5 o’clock at his own request.</p>
            <p>In reply to the Secretary’s opening question as to the state of the Chancellor’s
              health, the Ambassador said that he found Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> vigorous, full of humor and fully restored to health. The
              Secretary expressed his pleasure at this news.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador then handed the Secretary the attached personal letter from the
              Chancellor dated April 20<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Not printed.</note> and thanked
              him for <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0119"/>our cooperation in keeping the Federal
              Government informed concerning the negotiations on disarmament in London.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d50fn3">For documentation on the work of the U.N. Subcommittee on
                Disarmament, see <ref target="frus1955-57v20">volume xx</ref>.</note></p>
            <p>The Ambassador also handed the Secretary the attached personal letter from Von
              Brentano expressing his appreciation for our understanding of the Federal Government’s
              position on reunification.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">Not printed.</note></p>
            <p>The Ambassador then said that during his holiday the Chancellor had grown
              considerably disturbed over the general situation. In particular he was worried by the
              Franco-British disarmament proposal tabled in London,<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5"
                >Reference is presumably to the Anglo-French Working Paper Submitted to the
                Disarmament Subcommittee: Proposed Synthesis, March 19, 1956. For text of the
                proposal, see U.N. doc. DC/SC.1/38.</note> which, lacking United States sponsorship,
              gave the impression of a split among the three. He also resented the inclusion in that
              proposal of a ceiling of 200,000 troops for Germany, a figure which he said was
              arrived at and announced in the negotiations without any prior consultation with the
              Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler then turned to the matter of support costs. He said that Bonn
              recognized the difficult position that the United Kingdom was in, not only in foreign
              exchange but from a budgetary point of view. The United Kingdom was in the worst
                <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> of any of the parties involved. The Germans
              realize that if they cannot meet the British position there is the very real risk of
              withdrawal of British forces from the continent. This they consider must be avoided at
              all costs. Accordingly, Brentano, when he goes to London on Monday, will make certain
              proposals. It will not be possible to negotiate all the details then but the Germans
              are determined to reach an agreement. They will keep us fully informed of
              developments. Krekeler mentioned that one thought they had in mind was to take over
              all the expenses of one of the British Divisions in Germany which would be considered
              an instruction division for the German forces. Bonn has public opinion problems, he
              said, but he believes this could be presented as merely a payment for instruction and
              not as a continuation of occupation costs.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that in this matter of support costs the United States would not
              want to be discriminated against. We don’t like being taken for granted and he assumed
              the Federal Republic was equally interested in keeping United States forces in Europe
              as well as British. The Ambassador hastened to assure the Secretary that there was no
              thought of discriminating against the United States and certainly they wanted our
              forces there but, he added, “You and we don’t have financial problems.”</p>
            <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that in embarking on this
              bilateral discussion with the British he assumed the Germans had taken fully into
              account, in addition to our unwillingness to be discriminated against, the resentment
              which could be expected on the part of the French and Belgians against both the
              British and Germans. He pointed out that the negotiations for months had been
              conducted in common and that this unilateral operation by Germany would have
              repercussions. The Ambassador said he was sure that those factors had been taken into
              account.</p>
            <p>On support costs the Ambassador said that the payments would continue after May 5.
              There was a continuous flow of payments and this would continue until there was an
              agreement. The Germans, however, do not want to formalize any such continuation.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler then turned to the question of the conscription law. He said the
              Cabinet had taken the decision to push this through the Bundestag before the summer
              recess. It was difficult but they were going to do it. In reply to a question he said
              that the bill which they would push through would provide for 18 months period.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador then referred to a conference he had had with Ambassador Haas
              (assigned to Moscow), the Chancellor and Brentano. The latter feels strongly that the
              views of the Federal Republic on reunification must be presented to the Russians and
              kept before them. Haas will have no instructions to negotiate but he will be
              instructed to present the Federal Republic’s views. A draft, however, of his
              instructions will be sent to Washington for the Secretary to review before they are
              put in final form and communicated to Ambassador Haas. Krekeler emphasized that there
              was no thought of negotiations.</p>
            <p>On the matter of party organization, Krekeler said that the present Stuttgart meeting
              was very important. It had been decided to set up a top committee of ten members of
              the party, all of whom would take an active role in public and in politics with a view
              to impressing the country with the variety and depth of the leadership which the party
              possessed.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler reported that Brentano had been elated over the Secretary’s AP
                speech.<note n="6" xml:id="d50fn6">For text of <persName>Dulles</persName>’ speech

              discussion by the Permanent Under Secretaries of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> members, and (2) that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might set
              up some emergency economic assistance fund.</p>
            <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>
            <p>The Secretary indicated that his reaction was negative to the second proposal. He
              went on to say that the ideas behind his speech contemplated increased activity in the
              political area rather than the economic area. He spoke of such problems as Cyprus, the
              Saar, German reunification, French North Africa and the situation in the Middle East
              where the threat of hostilities jeopardized the oil supply on which all of Europe was
              dependent, as problems which deeply affected the strength and unity of the alliance
              and which hence could not be ignored by the Council.</p>
            <p>In taking his leave Ambassador Krekeler mentioned that Ambassador Eckhardt (now the
              Federal Republic’s Observer at the United Nations in New York) was probably going to
              be called back to Bonn to handle the government’s public relations and press
              relations. These have not been well handled, he said, in recent months.</p>

            <p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 10. Secretary opened talk with Brentano and
              Hallstein May 3 by saying he felt reunification should be kept in the forefront and
              used as test of new Soviet attitude in view Soviet agreement at Summit Meeting to
              reunification through free elections. He intimated that problem of relationship to
              disarmament had been somewhat exaggerated. He said Soviets are overextended in
              economic terms and might reduce in force for economic reasons. Western powers should
              determine their force levels in light their estimate of danger. Brentano expressed
              general agreement. He referred with satisfaction to communiqué issued at end
              Anglo-German talks and said that, after initial misunderstandings, Germans had reached
              full understanding with French which was reflected in new directive to Moch.</p>
            <p>Brentano said that while he hesitated to use term initiative in connection with
              reunification, he felt in order to show public opinion our position it would be
              necessary to take joint initiative. Question of timing would have to be considered. He
              indicated purpose was clearly to demonstrate to the man in the street our proposals
              and reasons for Soviet rejection. He believed it was not generally understood how far
              Western powers had gone at Geneva in their offers to USSR. <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94"
                facs="0122"/>He assured Secretary German initiative with Soviets would not become
              beginning of bilateral negotiations and that Federal Republic would proceed only with
              full agreement of Three Powers and possibly other (<gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> governments).</p>
            <p>Secretary raised support costs question, saying he felt impelled regretfully to say
              Federal Republic had not been as responsive as it should have been to its obligations
              in this matter. US had tried to orient its policy to support Federal Republic. It was
              unpleasant to encounter this type of situation. We hoped that the question was on way
              to solution since he understood from luncheon conversation with <persName
                corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> that it was going somewhat better. However,
              he wished to express his concern to Brentano. Brentano said form of presentation
              proposal at end of last year had been unfortunate. If matter had been presented
              differently, it might have been better received. He regretted manner in which question
              had developed and had attempted to present it before cabinet. He was determined to
              find reasonable solution in light of political aspect and would report to Cabinet on
              his talks in London and Paris. Secretary said that we would approach problem in
              sympathetic fashion and indicated desirability finding some solution in politically
              acceptable form.</p>
            <p>Secretary asked Brentano status of conscription legislation, remarking that 12-month
              period of service was inadequate. Brentano said law would be passed but he could make
              no assurances regarding period of service, which he indicated has become partisan
              issue. The Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> and <persName
                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> impressed on him seriousness of problem which
              would be created by German adoption of 12-month period. They pointed out it is likely
              to result in other countries cutting their conscription period with serious
              consequences for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military strength. Secretary
              said it had been expected German membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              would add to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s military effectiveness. If first
              important act of Federal Government was of this character effect would be to weaken
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Brentano reiterated political difficulties
              apologetically, saying that some people thought it would be better to adopt 12-month
              period and win next elections.</p>
            <p>The Secretary expressed to Brentano his thoughts on further development of Western
              organization as suggested in recent New York speech. He said he was not thinking of it
              as some new gadget to add to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but of fundamental
              solution to problems facing West. This problem was how, in the first place, to
              maintain unity of West and prevent Soviets from exploiting difficulties between
              Western powers. Second there was a problem of dealing with under-developed areas and
              how to meet difficulties caused by Soviet aid and exploitation of feelings of
              non-white races. Third was problem of how free enterprise system could deal with
              Soviet competition operating on political motives and without regard to costs or
              profit factor. He thought <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0123"/>these problems should
              be studied by Western nations either in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or
              possibly in council organized outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Hallstein
              said Federal Government in general agreement. He suggested that there should be body
              composed of representatives of five or six governments able to extend aid rather than
              use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. Present meeting, however, should
              confine itself to urging member governments to do everything possible to counteract
              Soviet moves.</p>
            <p>The Secretary referred to forthcoming visit of Icelandic Foreign Minister to Bonn. He
              said it would be helpful if Chancellor could mention base question Gudmunson. Brentano
              agreed.</p>

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Reunification and General Political
              Situation</hi></p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said he would address himself in
              turn to these specific points mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1"
                >Elbrick</persName>. As for the reunification problem he had no ready solution. He
              thought the term “reunification” needed concrete definition because there was danger
              of it becoming a meaningless slogan. From his own standpoint the term meant
              reunification on the basis of (1) free elections and (2) a guaranty of security. He
              expressed the view that the Germans could get reunification in short order were they
              to break away from their alliance with the West and adopt a neutralist attitude. He
              considered it imperative, however, to avoid the concept of reunification as an end in
              itself without regard to the conditions under which it was brought about.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> continued that genuine
              reunification under tolerable conditions might take a short or a long time but must in
              any case be achieved in full concert with the Western Allies. There was need, however,
              for a bit more elasticity in Western policy on this issue. He stressed the danger of a
              general mistrust of the West on the part of the German people if the feeling were to
              grow that the West did not take reunification seriously. Among the socialists and
              neutralists there is an impression that the Allies have never made a real test of the
              Soviet attitude and have imposed conditions for reunification which they knew were
              unacceptable to the Soviets. It was necessary to adopt new tactics which would force
              the Soviets to react to our initiative and to disclose their intentions and their real
              price for reunification. He went on to emphasize that there was no question of
              Germany’s going back to Rapallo or “sitting between two chairs”— Germany would stick
              to its political principles and with the West. He reiterated that reunification at any
              price was unacceptable, but added that reunification without any price was impossible.
              He also expressed the view that German reunification and the liberation of Eastern
              Europe are one and the same problem, the solution of which could be brought about “in
              chapters”.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> thought there was a danger that
              the “new look” in Soviet policy might make too great an impression abroad and that the
              Soviets might become acceptable to Western public opinion, particularly in France,
              without paying the proper price. To maintain its current policy in force the Federal
              Government needed an active German and Allied attitude toward reunification and in
              dealings with the Soviets. It was not enough for Moscow to revise the slogans of
              Stalin; they must also be made to change their policies. It was necessary to continue
              to demand reunification on the basis of free elections. The West was too much on the
              defensive—psychologically, <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0125"/>politically and in
              the economic field—not only in Europe but in the Middle East and North Africa. He
              concluded on this point by stating there would be no hope for reunification under
              tolerable conditions if the Soviets were able to achieve a détente with the West, as
              for example in the field of disarmament, without paying a real price.</p>
            <p>In response Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> outlined our views on
              disarmament and its relationship to German reunification. He mentioned the recent
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting and the fact that France,
              Britain and the United States had demonstrated they are in complete agreement that any
              disarmament beyond the initial stage would be dependent on the solution of major
              political problems, of which probably the most important was German reunification.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler stated that as far as public opinion in Germany is concerned the
              West is always one step behind the Soviets. We must regain the initiative and thereby
              contribute to softening up the Soviet attitude.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <persName>Dulles</persName> said we had already made many statements on the
              German problem and inquired what further we could do that would be useful. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> had no specific suggestion to make,
              but did agree that the references to Germany in the President’s recent speech<note

              Bulganin–Khrushchev visit had been of invaluable importance.<note n="4"

            <p>Turning next to the political situation in Germany, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> stressed the need for maintaining the current level of economic
              activity and prosperity in Germany. It was also necessary to strengthen the basis of
              the Federal Government’s foreign policy. What was needed in this regard was a Western
              statement of trust in this policy, not only as far as <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> was concerned but for after <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName>; in other words there must be confidence in Germany as a
              reliable partner after <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s disappearance
              from the scene. There were several in the present government who could take <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s place and carry on his policies. (He recalled
              in this regard how relatively insignificant a figure <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> himself had been in Western eyes in 1948.) Thus, there was need
              for a statement from the United States of trust in the continuity of German policy as
              well as an active attitude toward reunification. As long as the Soviets hoped that the
                <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>
              would change German policy, they would not make “one millimeter” of concessions to the
              West.</p>
            <p>As for the 1957 elections, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName>
              expressed confidence that the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> would “win”; their
              present strength was over 40% of the <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0126"/>electorate
              and they were looking for partners. There could be no coalition with the <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, however, as long as that party was not satisfied to be
              the junior partner. The <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> could expect the full
              support of the <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FDP1"
                >FDP</gloss>; it could possibly also regain the support of the <gloss
                target="#t_BHE1">BHE</gloss>, but to do so it would have to espouse a strong Eastern
              policy.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler endorsed this statement and commented on the gratifying response
              he had had from the United States Congress with regard to the map he had sent to each
              member portraying the present division of the various areas of Germany.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">German Rearmament: Conscription
              Legislation</hi></p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said that we look forward to as
              quick as possible a German defense build-up. He said we understood there was
              difficulty in the German parliament with respect to the term of conscription and that
              there was an effort to reduce the 18 months proposed by the Government to twelve
              months. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> doctrine, subscribed to by General
                <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName>, recognized the necessity of a
              minimum of 18 months service under modern conditions and with modern weapons. A twelve
              month period in the Federal Republic would have effects broader than Germany since
              some of the other Allies would also be inclined to reduce their terms of service. This
              was a source of apprehension to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said there was some American and
              British opinion that German rearmament was too slow and that the slowness was
              deliberate. He commented that had <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> been ratified,
              there would be no problem. He conceded that the first phase of rearmament had been
              slow, but said this was attributable, aside from the long ratification procedure, to
              the fact that they were aiming for a state of readiness of the whole force of 500,000

              95,000 men in uniform by the end of this year and 500,000 by the end of 1958.</p>
            <p>As to conscription, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said that the
              law will be passed without any doubt. Possibly the legislation will authorize rather
              than obligate the Government to introduce an 18 month period of service. This would
              permit some flexibility and might mean 9 or 12 months service for some, depending on
              their functions, although they would stick to 18 months generally.</p>

                    the Germans continue to be attached by the European idea, the coincidence of the

                    more and more Germans tend to look at their problems predominantly from a
                    viewpoint of national self-interest. This tendency is reflected in the somewhat
                    negative attitude of a number of German leaders toward such specific European
                    integration projects as <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the
                    common market; their lack of enthusiasm for these projects appears to be

                    disadvantages of the arrangements in terms of short-range German national
                    interest. On the other hand both Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                      >Adenauer</persName> and Foreign Minister Von Brentano continue to lend their
                    strong support on broad political grounds both to the general concept of

                  <item>Despite the emergence of the tendency referred to above, there has not been

                    to find real benefit in their association with the West. During the occupation
                    the Germans displayed some disinclination to push themselves forward vigorously
                    in the international field. They now seem more disposed to take the initiative.
                    They exhibit interest in and a desire to assume responsibilities in various
                    areas of international life. In general their behavior in international
                    organizations has been cooperative and forward-looking. At the same time, they
                    appear to be strengthening their ties with the West in the political and
                    economic spheres. The Federal Government continues to display keen desire to
                    align itself closely with the United States despite some criticism in Germany
                    that the Government is too dependent on this country.</item>

                <p>Despite numerous assurances from the Federal Government that the German defense
                  contribution will be completed on schedule, disappointingly little progress is
                  being made. The delay is due in part to the thoroughness of the parliamentary
                  review which permanent German defense legislation has undergone in the interest of
                  insuring that it make adequate provision for civilian control of the army. While
                  this aspect of the situation affords a basis for confidence that the new German
                  army will not fall prey to the excesses and abuses of the past, the Federal
                  Government in other respects has been deficient in making plans and taking
                  measures to prepare the way for a <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0131"/>quick
                  build-up following the enactment of the legislation. Among the factors involved

                  provision for defense above Deutschemarks 9 billion and the fact that its plans
                  contemplate the receipt of substantial U.S. aid for which no adequate
                  justification has been given. In addition there is growing support to reduce the
                  conscription term from 18 to 12 months. This position, if enacted into law, will
                  further reduce the capability for an effective build-up.</p></item>

                <p>No progress toward this objective was made during the period as a result of

                  Germany except upon terms which would result in the bolshevization of the entire
                  country. However, the Four Power impasse over reunification has stimulated some
                  demand in West Germany that the Government develop greater self-initiative toward
                  reunification. The Federal Government meanwhile has given assurances that it will
                  not discuss the German unity question with the USSR except in closest consultation

                    its budgetary provision for defense or to press for enactment of an adequate

                  financial contribution for the development of the less developed areas, and at the
                  same time for developing closer ties between Germany and the Western Powers. A

                    Germany gives them a point of leverage against the Federal Republic for efforts
                    to split it from the Atlantic Community. Consequently the continued championing
                    of German unification by the West appears to be an essential element in tying
                    Germany to the free world. Should the suspicion that the West had lost interest

            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he understood there was no agreed agenda.
              He would be glad to take up any items which the Chancellor would like to bring up. If
              the points covered by the Chancellor did not cover all those he had in mind, he would
              raise additional points.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he was always glad to
              come to the United States and to have an exchange of views with the Secretary for the
              same reasons as those which the Secretary had mentioned. He said he wished to mention
              in the first place something which he had said to Dr. <persName>Conant</persName>
              within the last few days. This was that absolute reliance could be placed on the fact
              that the German obligations to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be
              fulfilled. There was a good majority in the Parliament for the actions to be taken and
              the way had been well considered. <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0136"/>There were
              a variety of laws to be passed. The most important was the conscription law. This
              would be passed before the summer recess of the Parliament inclusive of its passage by
              the Bundesrat. A law on the length of service for conscripted personnel would be
              passed in October at the latest.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he wished to make a remark in this connection. The press all
              over the world was very reliable. It was particularly reliable in Germany. Its
              reliability extended to what it did not report. He asked that, under these
              circumstances, particular importance be attached to the reports received by the U.S.
              Government from its Embassy in Bonn.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would be glad to do so on a reciprocal
              basis.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that it would be wise to keep secret this appraisal of the
              reliability of the press.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he was glad that the support cost question had been settled.
              He would have preferred to have had it settled earlier. He thought that, had this been
              done, it would have been settled more cheaply from his viewpoint. He thought that
              agreements would shortly be reached with the British and French as well. The
              Chancellor said that in this connection he wished to mention the very successful
              negotiations which had taken place the previous week and had resulted in the
              settlement of the Saar problem on the basis of agreement between the German, French
              and Saar Governments.<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">Following the defeat of the Saar
                plebiscite on October 23, 1955, negotiations were resumed between France and the
                Federal Republic of Germany to reach agreement on the future status of the Saar. On
                June 4, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and Mollet at a meeting in
                Luxembourg agreed that the Saar would return to Germany. Documentation on the Saar
                is in Department of State, Central File 762A.011.</note> The Saar would be united
              with Germany on January 1, 1957. A price would have to be paid for this, but this
              would do no harm. He thought that it was good to have this matter settled as the
              Germans went into an election year.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that it might be of interest to the Secretary for him to mention
              the German elections. In the course of the previous year, his opposition had increased
              and the size of the coalition had decreased. He thought that he had sent word to the
              Secretary last December that this might happen.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">See <ref
                  target="#d39">Document 39</ref>.</note> He preferred to have a smaller reliable
              majority than a large unreliable majority. He said that the last elections had been
              contested over the objective of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>.
              Unfortunately, the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> had not been achieved. He
              believed that new goals could be set for the German people. If this task were
              approached industriously and if the matter were well prepared, the elections could be
              won. In a country like Germany, foreign policy <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"
              />plays an important role both before and after the elections. It is important that
              people recognize that they have a good and stable foreign policy.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that a matter of great importance in this connection was the
              subject of German reunification or, as he preferred to call it, the liberation of 17
              million people. He said the Soviets are rather unscrupulous in the selection of the
              methods that they apply. They had sent letters to President <persName
                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">In a June 6
                letter to <persName>Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                  >Bulganin</persName> proposed, among other things, that in line with recent Soviet
                reductions in troops and armaments, the United States, Great Britain, and France
                also take steps to reduce their forces in Germany. <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"

                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> stated that an agreement on disarmament would
              facilitate the question of reunification.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">For text of this
                letter, dated June 6, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 182–183.</note>
              The Chancellor said that he would do nothing and send no reply to this letter without
              consultation with Germany’s allies. It would not be however correct to say that the
              letter had no significance. He said that he personally did not believe a word of it.
              He did not believe that anything had changed since the 20th Party Congress. However,
              one could not say this to the German people. Therefore he wished to suggest that the
              whole matter could be referred to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for study and
              recommendation. All the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries had not
              received letters, but all the recipients of letters were <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> states. The subject matter was of importance to all <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that if we proceeded in this way, we could achieve another
              purpose. Without awaiting the report of the three Wise Men,<note n="6" xml:id="d55fn6"
                >In May 1956, the North Atlantic Council established a three-man committee (Three
                Wise Men) to advise on ways to improve cooperation in nonmilitary fields and to
                develop greater unity within the alliance. For documentation, see <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v04#pg_137">vol. IV, pp. 137</ref> ff.</note> we could assign
              an important political task to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Russians do
              not like <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and think that it will gradually
              vanish. The stronger it becomes the more the Russians would dislike it.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said this brought him to another point. He thought that his views were
              known on this subject, that is, that no military alliance against a common enemy could
              be maintained unless the foreign policy of its members were coordinated. He wished to
              emphasize in his view an increase of the political activities of <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should not replace but be supplementary to the
              military functions of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He mentioned the speech
              which the Secretary had made some time ago in which he had favored the re-activation
              of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He was heartily in agreement with what the
              Secretary had <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0138"/>said. Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> had mentioned that the Cyprus question had never been
              discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. There were a number of other
              questions which, in his view, could also be discussed and the policies of the members
              of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> coordinated.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he thought the coordination of the policies of <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members was the most important task facing the
              Western nations. When <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was founded, we all feared
              a hot war. A hot war would not come if the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              member countries remained strong. Meanwhile the Russians were applying the strategy of
              the cold war, of propaganda, and of economic pressures. The actions of various <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries during the last few months made him believe
              that a greater degree of coordination was necessary. He thought that in a number of
              cases what had happened had not had the bad results which had been feared. However, if
              one country extended an invitation to the Soviets, if another country sent a
              delegation, if countries like the Scandinavians invited the Russian leaders to visit
              them, this created confusion in the West and built up confidence in Eastern Europe
              that there would be a breakdown of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that there was a theater of cold war against the United States in
              the Far East but he believed that the European theater would be the decisive one for
              the United States for reasons which he would enumerate. He said he had not had an
              opportunity to meet the Secretary since his visit to Moscow and he wished to give him
              a few impressions of his trip.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he had no choice but to go to Moscow. The German people
              would not have understood it had he not gone. Failure to do so would have left 10,000
              prisoners of war and 30,000 to 40,000 refugees in the hands of the Russians. For
              humanitarian reasons he could not have justified this to his own conscience. However,
              no word had been spoken which he would not have had Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
              hear. On the contrary, he wished that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> could have been
              present. From what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had told him, partly in very confidential
              talks, he thought that two important things had emerged.</p>
            <p>The first of these was that the Soviets regarded the United States as their main
              enemy which they feared. They are convinced that Communism under the USSR will
              dominate the world. All that he had seen in Russia was a mixture of pan-Slavism,
              nationalism, a conviction of the sacred duty of Russia and Communism, all directed
              against the United States. He had noticed that on a Saturday afternoon few people had
              wanted to see the tombs of Lenin and Stalin. However, there had been many people
              visiting the Kremlin and the churches in it which had been restored by the Soviet
              Government at great cost. These were portrayed to them as precious national monuments.
              Similarly, the tomb of <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Ivan</persName> the Terrible was
              shown to the <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0139"/>people and was viewed with great
              respect. The Chancellor said that he had come to the conclusion that the Soviets
              wished to present themselves as the historical successors of the Czars and the
              spreaders of Slavism.</p>
            <p>The second thing was that he had been impressed by the great frankness with which
                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken of the difficulties
              confronting the Soviets. He was very candid as to these difficulties, particularly in
              the social field. He had said that the Soviet difficulties had been increased by
              financial problems, by the problem of keeping pace with the United States in the field
              of armament, and by the great claims being made on the Soviet Union by Red China.
                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had repeatedly pointed out that
              the increase of the birth rate in China was over 12 million persons a year. He had
              said to the Chancellor, “Imagine what you can achieve with these millions of people
              who live on a handful of rice.” He had added that the Soviets could overcome these
              difficulties by themselves but they could do it faster with the help of the Germans.
              That was the main point of talks which had lasted for hours, that is, the help which
              Germany could give the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
              also spoken of other European countries, the Chancellor said, but he was too polite to
              repeat what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that, in conclusion, he wished again to stress that the Soviets
              regarded <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> under U.S. leadership as their main
              enemy. This was why it was absolutely necessary in his view to maintain the military
              strength of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to activate it in the political
              field. If this happened it would encourage the hopes of the peoples enslaved by the
              Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he wished to speak of the weaknesses of <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Federal Republic had chosen as its
              representatives to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ambassador Blankenhorn, one
              of the best men in its foreign office. From a great number of talks which he had had
              with Blankenhorn regarding the activities of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, he
              did not have the impression that all of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              countries had selected distinguished men as their representatives. He had also
              received the impression that a number of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              governments did not inform their Ambassadors of the world political situation or give
              them instruction on these matters. The only explanation which he could give was that
              initially the military aspects of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had been the
              main focus of its activities and that there had been a tendency for these activities
              to run in the same groove. As the situation had been changed, other governments had
              not drawn the necessary consequences.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he thought the first thing to do was to instill new life
              into the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. In the second place, it was
              necessary that the foreign ministers of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              countries should keep their ambassadors to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              better informed. It was also necessary <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0140"/>that
              the Secretary-General be given greater power. Finally, the state secretaries in the
              ministries of foreign affairs or their deputies should have regular meetings with the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ambassadors to discuss the world political
              situation. All these measures should be taken as soon as possible without awaiting the
              report of the Three Wise Men. They would simply involve administrative measures which
              each individual country could take. If the leading countries were to take them, the
              others would follow suit. The Chancellor said that if the Secretary could accept the
              suggestion that the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letter should be
              studied and discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, this could be the
              occasion of these reform measures.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that it was desirable that the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> letters be taken up in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              for another reason. The Russians had tried in their various letters to split the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. If the letters were discussed in
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the Soviets would give up this effort. The
              Russians employ extremely crude methods. They would understand crude countermeasures.
              The Chancellor remarked in this connection that, when he was in Moscow, <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had told him with considerable satisfaction of
              having received a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                >Eisenhower</persName>. This was the type of simple measure which the Russians took
              to create the dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he wished to make a comment on the 20th Party Congress. At
              the beginning, he thought, the condemnation of Stalin was a blow directed against
                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> was clearly on the way toward becoming a new Stalin. The
              Chancellor could not imagine that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> could
              have started the matter without the backing of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName>. Then <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who is
              an adroit and sly customer, had put himself at the head of the movement. Perhaps he
              had condemned Stalin too much. This would eventually be seen by the results in the
              satellite countries. The Chancellor said that Stalin had once done the same thing in
              1937. He had written a number of chapters in a book on the horrors of a one-man
              dictatorship and said that the Communist Party should return to the principle of
              collective leadership.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that Mollet had given him a report of the talks which he and
              Pineau had had with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> in Moscow.<note n="7" xml:id="d55fn7">Mollet
                and Pineau paid an official visit to the Soviet Union May 15–19.</note> The
              influence and role of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appeared to be
              greater than when the Chancellor had been in Moscow in September. He had had the
              impression at that time that the two were on an equal level. However this was not
              Mollet’s impression. By way of proof, the Chancellor said that in the talks with
              Mollet, although <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> entered the room
              first it was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> who sat opposite Mollet
              and who conducted the negotiations. When the Chancellor <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113"
                facs="0141"/>had been in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had
              sat opposite him and conducted the negotiations. The Chancellor concluded that during
              the intervening time the roles of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
              and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had been reversed.</p>
            <p>Another observation which the Chancellor made indicating a change in the Soviet Union
              was the following. When the German delegation was in Moscow, the Red Army had played
              no part in the discussions. There had been a large reception in St. <persName
                corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>’s Hall, at which there had been a small group of
              marshals in a corner. The soldiers had played no significant role. On the other hand,
              Mollet had told him that the Soviet marshals were present at all the meetings and at
              the receptions. The Chancellor said that this had confirmed an impression which he had
              had that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had established closer
              relations with the Red Army. He also had the impression that <persName
                corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> was on bad terms with <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> because the latter had suggested that
                <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> be banned in Stalin’s time.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor concluded that since September <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> had become the leading figure in the Soviet Union and that
                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> was no longer first or even equal.
              Also, since September, the Red Army had become a more significant factor. He said that
              he did not think it was necessary for him to speak on the personality of <persName
                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> whom the Secretary had met at Geneva. He
              thought the Secretary would agree with him that he was a dangerous type of man.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thanked the Chancellor for his views on these
              important matters. He said he would comment in turn on the matters which had been
              mentioned. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said in the first place, he had no doubt
              that the Federal Republic would discharge its obligations as a member of <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He was not unaware of the difficulties which the
              Chancellor had encountered nor was he surprised by them. He had previously noted
              similar difficulties in Japan, which had recovered its sovereignty earlier. He thought
              he might repeat in confidence something which he had said to Prime Minister Yoshida
              two or three years ago. He had said that a nation under present conditions is not
              fully sovereign unless it contributes a fair share to the forces needed to maintain
              peace and order. A nation which does not have an appreciable military force of its own
              is not a fully sovereign state but a protected state which is not entitled to speak
              fully on foreign affairs. The Secretary said that we all hope the time will come when
              arms are limited and disarmament prevails. Until then, provision of the forces needed
              to preserve peace in the world is a measure of a nation’s maturity. He had no doubt
              that the German people would support the Chancellor’s efforts in this connection not
              merely because of their obligations to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
              important though that is, but because unless this were done Germany could not speak on
              world affairs to the degree to which she is entitled.</p>
            <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0142"/>
            <p>The Secretary said he wished next to express his appreciation of the action taken by
              the Federal Republic to provide support costs for the next year. He knew how difficult
              these things were, particularly when a government had such a good finance
              minister.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he believed both the Federal Republic and
              the French Republic were entitled to a great deal of gratitude from the rest of the
              world for having reached what one would hope to be a solution of the Saar problem. The
              fact that the Saar will, with the assent of the people of the Saar and the assent of
              France, become integrated with the Federal Republic represents a great achievement for
              the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the Chancellor had referred to the
              forthcoming German elections. As the Chancellor knew, he had to be scrupulously
              neutral in referring to elections in other countries. He wished to assure the
              Chancellor that his sentiments of neutrality were the same as four years
              previously.</p>
            <p>The Secretary referred to the problems of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to
              which the Chancellor had devoted a large part of his remarks. He said that he was in
              general agreement with what the Chancellor had said. An alliance of this kind could
              not be strong and stable unless there is basic accord among its members on foreign
              policy. Since the speech he had made to which the Chancellor had alluded a great deal
              of thought had been given by the United States to what to do about harmonizing the
              foreign policies of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. The problem was
              somewhat difficult from the standpoint of the United States because it has world-wide
              interests to a greater degree than other nations. While the United States desires
              greater harmony in the policies of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, it
              does not want this at the cost of submitting its world-wide policies to scrutiny and
              veto in the North Atlantic Council. The Secretary said that he had had an informal
              talk the previous day at great length with Mr. <persName>Pearson</persName>, who is
              studying this problem.<note n="8" xml:id="d55fn8">Pearson visited the United States
                June 9–11.</note> He had suggested to Mr. <persName>Pearson</persName> that there
              might be a demarcation between foreign policies relating rather directly to the <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area and foreign policies which while of interest are
              not of direct concern to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He had had prepared
              for him an informal paper for talking purposes in which were listed a number of
              subjects on which he thought there were unfortunately no common policies among the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments. It might be of interest to the
              Chancellor if he read this list, on which there should be coordination of policies. He
              said he would do so adding more comments than he had given Mr.
                <persName>Pearson</persName>:</p>

              <item><p>The Unity of Germany.</p>
                <p>The Secretary said that while we all give lip service to the reunification of
                  Germany, it is not certain that all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                  governments act on the principle that the unification of Germany is indispensable,
                  that it must be achieved quickly, and that it is something without which the peace
                  of Europe cannot be achieved. The Secretary said that he believed that if there
                  were a genuine concert of purpose on this subject, that if all of us impressed
                  upon the Soviet Union that the unification of Germany was the first thing which
                  must be done, this concert of purpose could be achieved.</p></item>

                <p>The Secretary said that in his opinion the present situation particularly lends
                  itself to the liberation of 17 million Germans and the development of a
                  considerable measure of independence by the so-called satellites. He said that
                  there is a great deal of confusion in the Communist parties. There is a great deal
                  of uncertainty on the part of the leaders in the satellites as to what the future
                  holds for them. There are feelings of ambition which are stirred by the example of
                    <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. There is a strong desire for a
                  higher standard of living. These are opportunities which have not existed
                  previously and may not continue. There should be common policies to utilize these
                  opportunities.</p></item>

              <item><p>Soviet and Chinese Approaches on the Limitation of Armaments, Trade and
                  East-West Contacts.</p>
                <p>The Secretary said that, as the Chancellor had pointed out, it had turned out
                  that no great harm has come from the visits of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                    >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> to
                  London and Mollet to Moscow. These visits were undertaken without consultation in
                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and great harm could have resulted from
                  them. When General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> had been
                  invited to visit Moscow for Aviation Day, the U.S. had intended to have
                  consultation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> about the matter. We had
                  found that the British and French had immediately accepted similar invitations so
                  that there was no occasion for consultation. The Secretary remarked that there are
                  powerful Communist parties in France and Italy. He thought that countries which do
                  not have such parties do not always think of the effect their actions could have
                  on the standing of the parties in these countries.</p></item>

                  such as North Africa. He did not include all colonies which he regarded as too
                  vast a subject for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but those in close-lying
                  areas such as North Africa.</p></item>

                <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that at the meeting of the Organization of
                  American States at Caracas in 1954, he had obtained a resolution recognizing <pb
                    n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>that if international Communism gained
                  control in any one of the American states, this was a matter of concern to all and
                  for action by all. He supposed it would be difficult to get acceptance of this
                  principle by all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries but in his
                  opinion the principle was a valid one.</p></item>

                <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that at the present time Western Europe
                  received daily 2-½ million barrels of oil from the Middle East. This oil moves
                  through pipelines which run through Syria or through the Suez Canal, which is
                  under Egyptian control. The industry of Western Europe would be paralyzed and the
                  operation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be greatly impaired if
                  the USSR or its friends or agents were able to cut off this oil.</p></item>

              <item><p>Further Integration of Western Europe.</p>
                <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that projects such as <gloss
                    target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the common market are vital for the
                  salvation of Western Europe, but there are differences of policy among the <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries on these subjects. The USSR is
                  transforming itself rapidly, with the benefit of forced labor, into a modern and
                  efficient industrial state in which atomic energy would be important. It would
                  have an assured common market of 800 million people. He said he did not think
                  Western Europe could survive economically with what in many countries are obsolete
                  plants, with cartels, with small markets, all resulting in high costs. He thought
                  that at the present time the economic danger from the Soviet Union was perhaps
                  greater than the military danger.</p></item>

              <item><p>Differences among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Countries.</p>
                <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he had in mind such differences as the
                  Cyprus problem which could not perhaps now be wisely brought before <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but which might well have been before the

            </list>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that, while the Chancellor would see that he did
              not propose to bring all the problems of the world into <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss>, he thought the list which he had presented included matters of great
              importance.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he agreed with what the Chancellor had said
              about the quality of representation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which in
              many cases had not come up to the standard which had been set by the Federal Republic
              and the U.S. The U.S. representative in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is a
              former Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and has Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ full confidence. If he has not entered into a
              discussion of all these problems, it is because there is no common agreement among the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments that these problems should be
              discussed in the Council. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he had told Mr.
                <persName>Pearson</persName> that if there were a common desire on the part of the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117"
                facs="0145"/>to do so, the U.S. Government would be prepared to keep its Permanent
              Representative in touch with the thinking of the President and of the Secretary of
              State regarding these matters. He himself believed that the evolution of <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should be along the lines which had been
              discussed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the Chancellor had suggested that, as an
              experiment, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments should submit to the
              Council their replies to the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letters.
              He thought that the U.S. would be prepared to have the topic raised very promptly and
              discussed by the Permanent Representatives to see what comes out of the discussion. He
              remarked that there were certain aspects of the reply which would have to differ in
              each case. The U.S. would want to say, without blowing its own trumpet, that it had
              materially reduced the number of its forces even before the Russian had done so. There
              are also references to Germany and to troops in Germany which should be the subject of
              a common response by the Federal Republic and the powers which have special
              responsibilities in Germany.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he was always afraid, when it came to
              consultation about documents which are to be public, the result would be based on the
              policy of the most timid government. He recalled at the last <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> meeting Pineau had fought against any reference in the communiqué
              which was less than friendly to the USSR.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that within these limitations he believed that the U.S. could
              accept the Chancellor’s suggestion with regard to the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> letter, to see how it worked. He thought that perhaps it would
              be possible to give more concrete form to this proposal and there might be an
              opportunity to discuss it further the following day.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he appreciated the information and appraisal which the Chancellor
              had given of his visit to Moscow and the development of the Russian leadership. In
              general, the Chancellor’s analysis lay along the lines of U.S. thinking but it was
              useful to have an authoritative confirmation of this thinking.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he believed he had covered most of the points
              which the Chancellor had mentioned but he wished to make one or two additional
              comments. He thought the American nation as a whole, both its government and people,
              recognized that the Soviet Government was hostile to the U.S. and is planning by all
              possible means to extend Communism throughout the world. One might perhaps gather from
              the press, to which the Chancellor had alluded, that there were great differences
              within the United States. He himself thought that on the contrary there was an
              extraordinary degree of unity and resolution. He said that discussions were going on
              at the moment about the Mutual Security Program. He thought the appropriations would
              be as great as those of the last year. The doubt was as to whether they would be
              greater. This doubt arose from two <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0146"/>causes.
              One relates to technical matters involving the accounting methods of the Defense
              Department relating to how much is in the pipeline. The second reflects questions in
              the minds of some people as to the resolution of our allies and whether it is
              worthwhile to help them. However, there is no doubt in anyone’s mind as to the
              resolution of the Chancellor. There is a feeling that there is softness in some places
              and perhaps money proposed to be spent for foreign aid could be spent to better
              advantage otherwise.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that there was no doubt in the U.S. as to the
              hostile purpose of the Soviet Union nor as to the resolution of the U.S. to meet this
              challenge. He said that the U.S. would maintain its military power to devastate the
              Soviet Union. We believe that this would be a deterrent to a general war and we remain
              ready and determined to help any allies who are prepared to stand firm.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that he wished to
              express his appreciation for what the Secretary had said and to add a few words of
              explanation to his previous remarks. With respect to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss>, he did not have in mind giving it a veto power. He was thinking of a
              genuine discussion of a variety of problems. He recalled that there were various
              matters which had already been discussed which did not involve military matters, for
              example, embargo policy [East-West trade controls].<note n="9" xml:id="d55fn9"
                >Brackets in the source text.</note> When he recalled that the invitation which had
              been sent to Pineau had originally been extended to <persName corresp="#p_PA1"
                >Pinay</persName> and that it might have gone to Mendes-France, he thought that the
              subject of visits was one on which consultation would be useful. In this connection,
              he mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName> had wanted to come
              to Bonn. He had consulted the British Government, which had thought that an invitation
              would be undesirable. As a result, the Federal Republic had not extended one. The
              Chancellor thought that this would have been a useful subject for discussion by <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. As regards the answer to the <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letter, the Chancellor said that he did not
              have in mind that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would work out a text but that
              it would discuss the matter and that the wording of the replies would be
              differentiated according to the circumstances.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor also commented on the varying accounts regarding what <persName
                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said to Mollet in Moscow. He said that
              Pineau had given an interpretation to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks which was impossible even on philological grounds
              but that there was no doubt in his mind that Mollet had said what the Chancellor had
              attributed to him.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor suggested that the Secretary ask his staff to evaluate whether things
              were going well in the Soviet Union. He said that the Secretary had referred to the
              building of atomic energy <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0147"/>plants in the USSR.
                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had given him a glowing account of
              Soviet development of atomic energy. However, <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                >Malenkov</persName> had told him that this was far from true and that he did not
              agree as to the possibilities of nuclear energy. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                >Malenkov</persName> had said that he thought the British atomic energy program was
              too optimistic. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> had also told him that
              because of the shortage of power, the Soviets are trying to develop power on the
              rivers in the Arctic regions. This, however, was a vast enterprise which would take a
              long time to develop. With respect to the Secretary’s remarks regarding common markets
              in the Soviet bloc, the Chancellor remarked that 600 million of the 800 million people
              involved are Chinese. Even <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is afraid
              of the 600 million. The Chancellor said that he thought one should take a calm view of
              developments in the Soviet Union. Conditions were bad particularly in agriculture. He
              had seen this for himself. This was also the impression of Pineau, who took an
              extensive trip in the country. He said that for some months he had been trying to find
              out about the population of the Soviet Union and its movement. There were three
              different sources of information which gave conflicting results. He was inclined to
              view any information received with great skepticism. He had talked with numerous
              prisoners of war who had been in various parts of the Soviet Union. Their reports were
              that conditions were bad. They had to feed their Russian fellow workers from the Red
              Cross packages which they had received.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he had not intended to give the impression
              that all was well in the Soviet Union. He knew quite well that the Soviets were
              over-extended in many fields and that they had a real problem in agriculture. On the
              other hand, they have a rate of industrial growth which is more rapid than that of
              Western Europe. He thought it would be a mistake not to be concerned with this
              competition, having in mind that it would not be normal competition but an instrument
              of economic warfare. He realized that there was an immense demand in the Soviet Union
              for all that could be produced, but there is a possibility that this demand would be
              suppressed as heretofore for purposes of Soviet expansionism.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he thought there was a great deal of truth in what the
              Secretary said. However, he did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> would have mentioned the Soviet difficulties so frankly
              unless these difficulties really existed, particularly the stress which he had placed
              on social problems and the demands of the Chinese. He said one should not overlook the
              fact that a new generation is growing up, including the children of the party leaders,
              who are used to things which they would not wish to give up. He thought that one
              should watch developments in the Soviet Union very carefully and should do nothing
              which would in any way help the Soviets.</p>
            <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0148"/>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he would like to raise two additional points. The first of
              these was the Saar agreement. He said that an agreement was concluded in 1946 between
              the U.S., U.K., and French regarding the Saar. He wished to ask whether the new Saar
              agreement could go into effect without U.S. and U.K. approval. Otherwise, the Russians
              might want to give their approval.</p>
            <p>The second matter was that of the German assets in the U.S. Many people have expected
              that the $10,000 bill will be enacted. It would be a great disappointment if the
              Senate did not settle this matter. He recalled that it was hoped that this would only
              be a beginning.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would have the Saar matter looked into
              from the U.S. viewpoint.<note n="10" xml:id="d55fn10">Professor Hallstein later stated
                that this request could be disregarded. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> As to
              the matter of German assets, he had looked into it within the last day or so. The
              legislation required action by the House of Representatives as well as the Senate, and
              there was a prospect of delays in that house as well. He said that we would do what we
              could but that there was a doubt in his mind as to whether any action could be taken
              this year.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he intended to see Senator Johnston and to speak to him
              about this. He hoped the Secretary would not object.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would not. He said that he thought he
              should mention that he did not believe there was any understanding on the U.S. side as
              to further steps beyond the return up to $10,000. The Chancellor said that in speaking
              of hopes he was referring only to the German Government and not to the U.S.
              Government. The Secretary said that one could have hopes but should not have
              expectations.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> suggested that the discussion might be continued the
              following day after lunch at the Blair House.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that the Communiqué would be dealt with on the following day and that
              meanwhile the following statement would be given informally to the press: <quote
                rend="blockquote">

            <p>At dinner we had some discussion about <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
              with the Chancellor and also with Hallstein, who sat at my left, and to whom the
              Chancellor referred some of my questions. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> said that they were afraid that the <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                >EURATOM</gloss> was being set up in such a way that it would promote socialism. He
              favored the idea in principle, but did not want it to operate to socialize industry in
              Europe. Hallstein said that on this account they had felt compelled to make a
              reservation at the Venice meeting. He felt that the agency should not retain
              ownership, but should exercise all the controls that could be exercised if there were
              ownership.</p>
            <p>I spoke of the relationship of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> to the
              common market and said that while the United States favored both developments, it did
              not seem to us wise to condition one upon the other. I felt that each step could be
              taken on its own merits and that the creation of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                >EURATOM</gloss> would of itself maintain a momentum favorable to the common market.
              Hallstein seemed to indicate acceptance of this view, but somewhat confusedly.</p>

            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> asked the Chancellor whether he knew of any way in
              which he could be of help in the question of reunification.</p>
            <p>Chancellor said he was of the opinion that it was essential that the Soviets not be
              given the impression that reunification had been shelved. It must be re-emphasized
              again and again. It is not enough for the Germans to speak again and again. It is
              necessary that the Three Powers keep the pot boiling, so to speak, so that the Soviets
              would not think the matter had been dropped. He said he was certain this would have an
              effect on the satellites and East Zone. He thought that certain developments might
              take place and that this course of action might precipitate them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the United States Government was prepared
              to transmit the letter it had received from <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council for
              discussion in accordance with the suggestion the Chancellor had made the previous day.
              He assumed the Federal Republic was prepared to do likewise in view of the
              Chancellor’s suggestion.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that this was correct and that he was very grateful for Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ agreement.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that we might suggest to our representatives
              that the reply to the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letter as
              respects Germany should recall the pledges made by <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at
              Geneva. He thought we should do as the Chancellor had suggested with regard to
              reunidication, that is, we should keep the subject in the forefront and continue to
              keep pressure on the Soviet rulers.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> asked whether there were any other subjects which
              should be discussed. He said that he thought that the question of <gloss
                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> had been dealt with in the discussion with
              Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> the previous evening. He
              wondered whether there was anything to be discussed in regard to Berlin.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that there had been some rather unpleasant developments in Berlin
              recently. There had been contacts between the Soviets and the Berlin authorities. He
              said there was a group in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> in Berlin, which is
              the strongest party in the City, which favored discussions with Pankow. He thought
              that the only way to deal with this subject was through the other parties. He remarked
              that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> has two wings and there are communist
              elements in it. This was the reason why it was so difficult for him to come to
              agreement with the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> on questions of national
              interest.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that it was hoped that the President would be
              able to send a letter to President Heuss on the occasion of the commemoration <pb
                n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0151"/>of the June 17 uprising.<note n="2"
                xml:id="d57fn2">On June 16 and 17, 1953, workers in East Berlin, responding to
                Communist-imposed work norms and economic controls, demonstrated throughout the
                city. Martial law was declared and Soviet troops and tanks were required to restore
                order. For documentation on the incidents, see <ref

              would be grateful if this could be done.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then discussed and agreed on the
              news communiqué.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">The text of the joint communiqué, issued
                on June 13 as Department of State Press Release No. 322, is printed in Department of

              course of the discussion, the question was raised as to whether the word “determined”
              should be used in the following sentence: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Chancellor
                    <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> emphasized German reunification
                  as a major objective of the West and the conviction that the attitude of the West
                  toward the Soviet Union should be determined by the endeavor to promote the
                  reunification of Germany in freedom.”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he thought it was important to express the thought in strong
              terms. He said that the reunification should be used as a criterion for judging Soviet
              action. He referred in this connection to the Soviet conversations with the British
              and French. He said that the Soviets had tried to frighten the British and French by
              saying that if Germany were reunited, it would dominate the whole of Europe. He said
              that the question of reunification of Germany was the decisive one for the future of
              Europe. If a weak formulation were used in this connection, the Soviets would notice
              it. He thought it was important to indicate American policy clearly. He suggested that
              the sentence as drafted accurately reflected previous American policy.</p>

            <p>The meeting was attended by the President, Mrs. <persName>Eisenhower</persName>,
              Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and myself acting as interpreter.</p>
            <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0152"/>
            <p>The President opened the conversation by welcoming the Chancellor and expressing his
              regret that he had been unable to participate more actively in the formal discussions
              and to greet the Chancellor’s son and daughter.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor thanked the President for the welcome and expressed his hope and that
              of the German people that the President’s recovery would be a complete and early one.
              He then stressed his extreme gratification about the President’s appearance which he
              considered as nothing short of a “miracle”.</p>
            <p>The President remarked that the Secretary and he had been giving a great deal of
              thought to the German problem and particularly to the question of helping “bring
              together again” the two parts of Germany.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor expressed his appreciation for the President’s remarks and stated
              that, in this connection, he was highly pleased with the course of the discussions and
              with the communiqué.</p>
            <p>The Secretary remarked, humorously, that of course we were always prepared to give
              the Chancellor what he desired to have.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor responded in similar vein remarking that in that case he would have
              liked to have some of the “$10,000 German assets”.</p>
            <p>The Secretary remarked that that was one of the problems created by the war which
              required time for final settlement.</p>
            <p>The President added that this problem had been with us ever since the end of the war.
              It was one of the questions which we would like to see solved, but unfortunately we
              had not been able to do it, so far.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the conversation was devoted chiefly to personal pleasantries. The
              President and Mrs. <persName>Eisenhower</persName> inquired about the Chancellor’s
              children and grandchildren. Mrs. <persName>Eisenhower</persName> expressed her
              appreciation of the silver which Mrs. Werhahn, the Chancellor’s daughter, had had
              presented to her. The Chancellor in turn expressed his thanks, in the name of his
              daughter, for the portrait which Mrs. <persName>Eisenhower</persName> sent her as a
              personal present and hinted that he might yet be tempted to “steal” it from his
              daughter.</p>

              <item>Conversation between the Secretary and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName> in the car going up to Walter Reed and back to Airport, June
                14, 1956</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Chancellor opened the conversation by informing the Secretary that the Social
              Democratic Party of Germany seemed to have completed its draft of the major platform
              for this year’s party convention. It suggested the exodus of the Federal Republic from
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, rapprochement with Pankow and an extension of
              the major reforms, carried out in the Soviet Zone under Soviet control, to the
              territory of the Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>The Secretary remarked that this in effect would mean the Communization of all of
              Germany.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor replied that this was exactly what it meant. But the platform, if
              maintained, would also have the effect of insuring the victory of the Government in
              the forthcoming elections.</p>
            <p>[<hi rend="italic">5 paragraphs (21 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
            <p>The Chancellor then referred to the forthcoming visit of French Foreign Minister
              Pineau. He expressed the view that M. Pineau was “a strange fellow”, most difficult to
              deal with; in fact, politically speaking, he was outright “bad”. The Chancellor also
              did not seem to be completely satisfied with the impending change of French
              Ambassadors.</p>
            <p>On the way to the airport, after the visit with the President, the Chancellor said
              that he hoped the Secretary would not take any offense if he stated that yesterday he
              had been very happy with the conclusion of the discussions and the communiqué, but
              today he was happier still. He thought that the President’s quick recovery was truly
              miraculous; his total appearance had seemed much better than the preceding year when
              he had seen the President last.</p>
            <p>The discussion turned to the successor of Lord Ismay and General <persName
                corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName>. The Chancellor paid a strong compliment to
              General <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName> whom he considered to be a
              man of extraordinary brilliance. He wondered who would take now the place of Lord
              Ismay (see separate memorandum on the Chancellor’s suggestions).<note n="2"
                xml:id="d59fn2">Not printed. (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers) Chancellor
                  <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> suggested that Sir <persName

                would be an “excellent choice.”</note></p>
            <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0154"/>
            <p>Subsequently, the Chancellor inquired about Ambassador Luce’s state of health and was
              quite elaborate in his praise of Mrs. Luce, whom he described as “one of America’s
              best Ambassadors in Europe”.</p>
            <p>The Secretary inquired jokingly whether the Chancellor was aware of certain press
              comments following his stay in Switzerland. The Swiss Government was reported to have
              viewed with some apprehension the fact that the Chancellor had used his vacation in
              Switzerland to conduct official business from neutral soil.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he had not been advised of these comments. He liked to spend
              his vacations in Switzerland but, in view of well known Swiss sensitiveness, he might
              in the future patronize Switzerland less frequently than heretofore.<note n="3"

            <p>At this point there was some discussion as to whether sufficient time was left for
              Council consideration of the next item, which consisted of three Progress Reports on
              German problems. It was finally agreed that in any case there was sufficient time to
              deal with any policy recommendations which might arise in the course of consideration
                <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0155"/>of these reports. Accordingly, Mr.
                <persName>Anderson</persName> commenced to brief the National Security Council with
              respect to progress in carrying out <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 160/1, dealing
              with U.S. policy toward the Federal Republic of Germany. He pointed out that the chief
              policy issue relating to policy toward the Federal Republic was the action for the
              National Security Council proposed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
              Board—namely, that the Council adopt the following draft action: <quote
                rend="blockquote">
                <p>“Reaffirmed the great interest of the U.S. in obtaining an adequate German
                  defense contribution, but agreed that, in the light of the developing political
                  situation in Germany, the U.S. should not press for a German defense build-up in
                  such a manner as would jeopardize the continuation of a moderate pro-Western West
                  German Government.”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>After referring to the above-mentioned Planning Board recommendation, Mr.
                <persName>Anderson</persName> said that he believed that the Director ot Central
              Intelligence would like an opportunity to re-state the views on this point which had
              earlier been brought to the attention of the Planning Board by the <gloss
                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representative on that Board. Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> undertook to re-state Mr. <persName>Amory</persName>’s
              views, pointing out that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had
              a very tough situation on his hands in the 1957 German elections, perhaps a tougher
              situation than the Chancellor himself realized. On the other hand, it was possible
              that in their recent conversations the Secretary of State had obtained differing views
              from the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then pointed out the views of the Joint Chiefs of
              Staff, which were opposed to the action proposed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                >NSC</gloss> Planning Board. He asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                >Radford</persName> if he wished to elaborate on the written views of the Joint
              Chiefs of Staff.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that this was simply
              another facet of the larger problem of where the United States was going, that the
              Council had been discussing in connection with its consideration of the continental
              defense policy. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were disturbed at the prospect of a delaying
              action which could result from Council agreement to the Planning Board proposal. We
              have got to come to a real understanding of what we are going to face in Europe and
              make the appropriate decisions. One of the most important of these would be the German
              participation in the European defense effort. Accordingly, Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> did not think this the appropriate time to
              delay our pressures on the Germans to make up their mind as to their participation. It
              was our duty to find out as soon as possible where the Germans stood on their
              contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> went on to say that the situation will be less
              satisfactory in Germany a year from now if we do not continue to push them on the
              nature of their participation. There was no reason to delay just because decisions are
              tough.</p>
            <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0156"/>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then invited the comments of the Secretary of
              State.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was not clear as to
              where, in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 160/ 1, the Planning Board was proposing
              to insert the language read by Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>. Mr.
                <persName>Anderson</persName> explained that the Planning Board did not propose to
              insert this language at all, but that the language would simply constitute a Council
              action in connection with the Council’s noting of the Progress Report on <gloss
                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 160/1. He also pointed out, in response to a question
              from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that achieving promptly
              a German contribution to the defense of Europe was both a basic objective and a
              significant course of action in the policy paper on Germany.</p>
            <p>Secretary Robertson inquired whether the amount and timing of the pressure to be
              applied by this Government on the Germans with respect to their participation in
              Western defense, was not properly a matter for the judgment of the Secretary of
              State.</p>
            <p>At any rate, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he did not
              think that the language proposed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
              Board should be inserted in the policy paper on West Germany. He added that in the
              just-concluding conversations with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, he
              had pressed the Chancellor just about as far as he could on the necessity for a German
              military contribution. He had done the same thing earlier with Japanese Prime Minister
              Yoshida. He had even gone so far as to tell the German and Japanese leaders that
              unless their countries developed adequate military forces of their own, they would
              have the status of protectorates rather than of truly sovereign states. Secretary
                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> submitted that it was difficult to
              push much further than this. Certainly we did not wish to emphasize our views so hard
              that the result would be the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> regime.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that every single
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nation was watching how the Germans handled
              the issue of their military participation in Western defense, and specifically their
              decision as to the length of service for conscripts in the new German army. Every
              nation will be affected by the failure of the Federal Republic to come through with an
              adequate military contribution. Moreover, if they do not do so, the United States will
              not know where it stands. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
              believed that the 18-month conscription period for the German soldier was less likely
              to be attained a year from now than to be attained now. While he admitted that we must
              not push <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> too hard, we must also not let
              the Germans off the hook.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that it seemed to him
              obvious that we do not wish to press the <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> government on this military issue to the point where that
              government might fall. This was particularly true in view of the fact that we
              ourselves may have reached the point of determining on quite a different concept of
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Moreover, <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129"
                facs="0157"/>if the Administration did not choose to revise the <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> concept, Congress itself might force the
              Administration to do so.</p>
            <p>After further discussion between Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                >Radford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
              Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he was personally
              unable to see much substantial difference in the points of view of Secretary <persName
                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                >Radford</persName> with respect to the German participation in the defense of the

            <p>I have been talking recently with my brother, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen

              regards conditions in East Germany. We think this is a matter as to which the Federal
              Republic is both best informed and most concerned. However, we do feel that
              developments resulting from our publication of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> speech create opportunities which should not be allowed to
              pass. The outbreak which occurred yesterday at Poznan illustrates what must be the

              I think that the Soviet rulers face a grave dilemma. They cannot maintain their iron
              rule without terrorism, and yet they cannot reconcile terrorism with their new

            <p>During the course of a call on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, the
              Ambassador referred to the reports which had been carried in the press regarding a
              change in American thinking regarding the size of armed forces. He said that he had
              been asked by his Government to send in a full report on the so-called <persName
                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> plan for a reduction in US forces by 800,000
                men.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Reference is to an article in <hi rend="italic">The
                  New York Times,</hi> July 13, which stated that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                  >Radford</persName> supported a cut in U.S. military forces by 800,000 men.</note>
              These instructions had been sent before the strength of German forces had become a
              matter of discussion.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador said that this was a matter of greatest concern to the German
              Government. There had just been a “great debate” in Parliament on conscription. The
              debate had been very heated in the Bundestag. The Chancellor had made a speech during
              the course of the debate in which he had referred to his visit to Washington. In
              response to an attack on the Government’s military program by Socialist Deputy Erler,
              the Chancellor had responded that he had been in Washington and was informed as to
              American thinking whereas Erler was not.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador said that the Federal Government had committed itself to raise a force
              of 500,000 men. He expressed distress that discussion of the size of American forces
              had now been extended to the maintenance of US forces in Europe, then into the size of
              German forces. The Ambassador said that he felt compelled to say frankly that it was
              rumored among newspapermen in Washington that the source of the stories regarding the
              change in American thinking on the German forces was the Secretary of State. It was
              said that the Secretary had given a background press briefing on his way to a regatta
              at Rochester. The Ambassador said that he had not informed his Government of these
              reports since he did not think he should report on rumors. He felt obligated, however,
              to make inquiry as to the accuracy of these reports.</p>
            <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that there had been a great
              deal of newspaper talk without foundation. These reports had been a matter of concern
              to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>. The United States was
              going through the annual process of reviewing its defense program. A large number of
              people were involved in this process and numerous individual ideas were put forward.
              However, the press reports were highly speculative. The United States Government had
              not reached any conclusion on the size of American armed forces. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the Secretary of State certainly would not
              have been the source of the rumors referred to.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that in the event that the
              United States Government should at some stage reach a conclusion that, in view of the
              development of new weapons, some reduction in the size of its armed forces might be
              called for, the size of the American contribution to the defense of the North Atlantic
              area would of course be subject to multilateral consultation and discussion in the
              North Atlantic Council. In this connection he recalled that the President had in March
              1955 sent a message to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and
              to the heads of other governments signatory to the Brussels Treaty that it would be
              the policy of the United States “to continue to maintain in Europe, including Germany,
              such units of its armed forces as may be necessary and appropriate to contribute its
              fair share of the forces needed for the joint defense of the North Atlantic area while
              a threat to that area exists, and will continue to deploy such forces in accordance
              with agreed North Atlantic strategy for the defense of this area”.<note n="3"

                  >Bulletin,</hi> March 21, 1955, pp. 464–465.</note></p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler said that he found Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName>’s statement very reassuring. It corresponded to the German
              viewpoint that these matters were all matters for discussion within <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He asked whether the Secretary would make a
              statement along these lines in his press conference the following day. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he did not know. He had not had an
              opportunity to discuss the press conference with the Secretary. The Ambassador said he
              thought it highly desirable from the German viewpoint that a statement be made at the
              press conference.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador also asked whether he could see the Secretary of State on Thursday,
              July 19. In view of the importance of the matter and the very close relations between
              the Chancellor and the Secretary, he thought it important that he be in a position to
              convey to the Chancellor some direct statement from the Secretary on this subject. The
              Ambassador said that he would also appreciate an opportunity to see Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>. He pointed out that he had no <pb n="133"
                xml:id="pg_133" facs="0161"/>Military Attaché and therefore thought it necessary to
              take the matter up with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
              himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he would inquire
              into both of these matters. He wondered whether it was a good idea for the Ambassador,
              in all the circumstances, to make a visit to the Pentagon which would become publicly
              known.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador said that the press reports were particularly unfortunate from the
              viewpoint of their timing. The conscription law had not yet passed the Bundesrat. It
              would come up within the next few days. It had been thought that it would go through
              without difficulty, but the chances of passage might be jeopardized by these reports.
              The Ambassador pointed out that the opposition to the Government had been taking the
              line that the proposals for a 500,000 man force represented an outmoded military
              philosophy and were in excess of what needed to be done.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Pauls</persName> pointed out that in the press it had been reported as
              the American view that it was no longer necessary for Germany to have a force of 12
              divisions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he was sure that the
              Secretary had not said anything of this kind.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the Ambassador said he would undoubtedly be
              asked by the press about his talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName>. He intended to say that he had called for a general discussion
              because he had been away on vacation. If he were asked whether the question of size of
              forces had come up, he would indicate that he had raised it but would not undertake to
              say what he had been told. He thought it would be well to say that he had had a
              satisfactory conversation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
              agreed.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName></hi>: Since I
              am taking off day after tomorrow for a six-weeks’ home leave, I am taking the liberty
              of writing you about the situation here in Germany as I see it. I shall be in
              Washington for four or five days after Labor Day, and if you are available I would be
              glad to discuss the contents of this letter further if you can spare me half an hour
              or so.</p>
            <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"/>
            <p>When the Bundestag adjourned for the summer about three weeks ago, the Chancellor
              could be satisfied with the legislative accomplishments of his coalition. The
              conscription law was passed but without a specification as to the length of service.
              The question of whether 12 or 18 months would be required has been put over for
              separate action next fall, and three weeks ago the Chancellor and his workers were
              confident that an 18-month law would be passed.</p>
            <p>A number of measures were taken by the Bundestag which the Chancellor and his Cabinet
              believe strengthened their position internally. These measures included certain relief
              for the farmers and an increased expenditure for those who had suffered from war
              damages and those who are living on certain types of pensions. These measures were
              frankly taken by the coalition with an eye to the election in 1957. The fact that from
              the point of view of internal politics the Chancellor continues to be highly
              successful is demonstrated by the fact that at the Socialist Party’s convention two
              weeks ago no matter of substance concerning the internal policy of the government was
              seriously questioned. Indeed, except for some lip-service to the word “socialism”, the
              program of this Party, from the point of view of economics, is remarkably conservative
              considering the fact that only ten years ago demands for nationalization of industry
              were still part of the Party program but have now disappeared.</p>
            <p>Against this favorable picture must be placed the fact that the Chancellor has been
              increasingly criticized by members of his own Party and members of his Cabinet and
              their staff. There seems to be no question but what he has had a struggle with his
              Minister of Finance, Mr. <persName>Schaeffer</persName>, which looks to the outsider
              like almost a struggle for power, though it has turned in part on what appears to be
              the basic tax and economic policy of the government. The Chancellor has also quarreled
              with his Minister of Economics, Mr. <persName>Erhard</persName>, who was opposed to
              the Chancellor’s policy in regard to the farmers, and in a technical discussion of the
              question of the rediscount rate spoke publicly in a critical vein of both Erhard and
              Schaeffer. This speech of the Chancellor’s before the Association of German
              Manufacturers has been deeply regretted by a number of his close associates, and the
              controversy which was aired in the press involving the Chancellor and his two chief
              Cabinet members certainly has tended to lower the Chancellor’s prestige.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor’s foreign policy, including his firm determination to proceed as
              rapidly as possible with the formation of a 12-division army, has been criticized not
              only by the opposition parties but increasingly by some members of his own party.
              There is a growing sentiment, which is expressed in the newspapers and by adherents to
              the Chancellor’s general policy, that some action must be taken to meet the criticism
              from the opposition that there has been too little <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135"
                facs="0163"/>initiative in regard to reunification. It is my own guess, based on
              conversations with members of the Chancellor’s party, that the government will go on
              to the offensive in this matter of reunification some time next winter. From the point
              of view of the election which takes place in September 1957, such timing would
              obviously be good politics. Therefore I think we may expect some developments from the
              Chancellor along the lines of new questions to be asked of Moscow or possibly even new
              proposals to Moscow. Indeed, it may be that this offensive will be started next
              October rather than delayed until the winter. Personally, I have no doubt that all the
              members of the Chancellor’s Cabinet and a vast majority of the Bundestag members of
              his coalition are sound and solid on the question of reunification. That is to say,
              there will be no tendency for the foreseeable future for them to toy with the present
              Russian offer of reunification through discussions between Bonn and Pankow.<note n="2"
                xml:id="d63fn2">An East German delegation visited Moscow July 16–17. The joint
                communiqué issued on July 17, noted, among other things, that the only one way to
                unite the two Germanies was through discussion and agreement between the two
                countries.</note> It may well be, however, that there will be further developments
              of the idea of having the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries agree
              to a modified <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if a freely elected all-German
              government decides to join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But I doubt if the
              government parties will be ready to suggest anything approaching a united Germany
              armed and disassociated from the other Western powers. Indeed, I am not sure that the
              opposition parties will be ready to push the idea of neutrality of a united Germany to
              its logical conclusion during the debates in the coming election year.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor’s health continues excellent, indeed amazing. Barring unexpected
              developments, I think one can assume he will lead his party in the election campaign
              in the summer of 1957. Whether or not he would then step down to make place for a
              successor, assuming the present coalition wins control of the Bundestag, is another
              question. There is an increasing number of Germans favorable to the Chancellor who are
              rather expecting and to some degree hoping that there will be a younger man as
              Chancellor after the fall of 1957. I may add that in my view there are several
              promising candidates to succeed the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>I do not share the view of some of the American correspondents here who think that,
              in view of the loss of prestige of the Chancellor, the present coalition will fail to
              obtain a majority in the Bundestag in the fall of 1957. The present coalition (<gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>–<gloss
                target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_FVP1">FVP</gloss>) has a majority of
              nearly 80 seats. It will take quite a shift in the voting pattern of the Germans to
              give the opposition enough votes to elect a Chancellor (and the voting pattern of the
              Federal Republic of <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0164"/>Germany, I believe, is
              now very largely determined by religious affiliations and class distinctions).</p>
            <p>I gather from indirect evidence that there is an interesting conflict of opinion
              within the Chancellor’s own party in regard to the advisability of a future coalition
              with the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. (Such a coalition is not to be confused
              with earlier talk of a grand coalition which would have included the old <gloss
                target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> as well.) There is also a conflict of opinion in the
                <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> as to the desirability of a coalition with the
                <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>. Just how
              this conflict will be worked out in the coming year is one of the interesting
              problems. The Chancellor himself would never consider such a coalition, and those who
              share his views are working to build up the dissenting party from the old <gloss
                target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>, namely, the <gloss target="#t_FVP1">FVP</gloss>. This
              party now has only ten votes in the Bundestag but they are hoping to increase this
              number at the expense of the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> which, you will
              recall, went into the opposition some months ago. I have reason to believe this move
              is being supported by a number of the Ruhr industrialists who are strongly back of the
              Chancellor,—the Chancellor’s foreign policy and, with certain exceptions, his internal
              policy as well. These industrialists would be deeply distressed if a coalition <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>–<gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> should come into power in Bonn. I think this group will
              finance the new <gloss target="#t_FVP1">FVP</gloss> and the Chancellor’s own party
              quite generously in the coming year.</p>
            <p>Although I think the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss
                target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> government in Bonn
              after 1957 is relatively slight, I should like to record my opinion that the
              Chancellor is unduly apprehensive about the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> party.
              As compared with the <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>, now that it has lost its
              better elements, the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> is a party which could
              conceivably be brought into good partnership with the Chancellor’s own party. [<hi
                rend="italic">19 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
            <p>To sum up, I think that there is little likelihood that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1"
                >SPD</gloss> will be in the government after 1957, assuming that the matters which I
              am about to treat will be worked out satisfactorily in the coming months. This leads
              me to the events of the last ten days which have upset the Chancellor and the members
              of his coalition government as well as opinion generally here in Germany. I refer to
              the rumors from Washington about the reduction in troop strength and the document
              which the British are presenting to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                Council.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">For documentation on the British proposal for
                troop reduction in Europe, see <ref target="frus1955-57v04#pg_123">vol. IV, pp. 123
                  ff</ref>.</note> If word of this British proposal had leaked before the Bundesrat
              acted on the new conscription law last Friday, it would not have been passed. Indeed,
              if the rumors from Washington had started a week earlier, the conscription law would
              have failed, in the opinion of the President of Bundesrat, with whom I had dinner <pb
                n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0165"/>Friday night. This would have meant,
              incidentally, that the machinery for calling up conscripts could not have been set up
              in time to have enabled the first recruits to have been called up according to their
              schedule early next spring.</p>
            <p>It would be quite out of place for me to intrude my personal opinion as to the
              strategic wisdom of a reduction of the strength of the ground forces here in Europe,
              but I would like to emphasize the grave complications that will result here in Germany
              if this matter is not firmly settled early next fall. It will be impossible, I fear,
              for the Bundestag to pass the supplemental conscription law determining the length of
              service as long as there is uncertainty as to what the attitudes of the United States
              and Great Britain will be in regard to the size of the ground forces needed here in
              Europe. Furthermore, the obvious intention of the British to raise next spring once
              again the issue of support costs is a complicating factor. It seems to me that the
              whole question of the strength of the forces here in Europe must be settled before the
              German government can proceed with its plans. Furthermore, it seems to me that the
              question of the British ability to find the DM funds to pay the expenses of troops
              stationed in Germany ought to be settled at the same time; another support cost
              argument would be a serious blow to the good relations between the Western Allies and
              the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
            <p>I am afraid there can be no doubt but that the discussions that have taken place in
              the papers the last few days have further damaged the Chancellor’s position. I am very
              apprehensive of the public discussions of the new British request to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> when the news of this “leaks” as it certainly will
              before many weeks have passed. Indeed, if things are not cleared up and settled
              satisfactorily next fall, I think my estimate of the outcome of the 1957 election
              would have to be greatly modified.</p>
            <p>The <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> is already saying that the Western Allies are
              now adopting the position which this party has all along advocated, namely, that
              modern weapons make a large army unnecessary. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
              is against any army, for the present at least. The combination of these two parties in
              a government after 1957 would be really disastrous from an American point of view;
              while the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> might make a satisfactory minor partner
              in a coalition with the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CSU1"
                >CSU</gloss>, it would make a very bad major partner in a coalition with the <gloss
                target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss>. Indeed, such an outcome of the 1957 election can only
              be regarded with horror by those of us who have been in close touch with the German
              scene for the last three years or so. Therefore, from the point of view of internal
              German politics, as well as getting forward with building a German army, fundamental
              discussions within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework need to be made
              in the very near future and the <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0166"/>British
              memorandum answered with a clear-cut decision that can be made public.</p>
            <p>I offer my apologies for the length of this letter, but I felt a summary of the
              situation here in Germany might be of value to you in the coming weeks.</p>

                  <persName>Dulles</persName> urged the Chancellor to accept the British invitation
                to a conference on the Suez Canal in London, August 16. <persName>Dulles</persName>’
                letter was transmitted to Bonn in telegram 341, August 3. (<hi rend="italic"

                Conference, see <ref target="frus1955-57v16">volume XVI</ref>.</note> The Ambassador
              requested that the Chancellor’s message be kept confidential since the German Cabinet
              will not meet until Wednesday to make a decision on the Suez Conference. The
              Ambassador asked whether we had any information regarding a rumor to the effect that
              Israel is mobilizing its military forces and that Soviet warships will proceed to
              Egyptian waters.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we had had no such indication from Israel although we had
              heard that Jordan was fearful that it might be subjected to an attack by Israel. As
              far as we can determine there is no basis for rumors regarding Israeli mobilization.
              The Secretary said that we find ourselves in a very delicate situation with reference
              to the Israeli-Arab situation at this moment and that it is very difficult to make any
              move to restrain the Israeli without unduly encouraging the Egyptians.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador said that he had heard the Secretary’s television report on Friday
              evening and he gathered that the United States had been cast in the role of
              restraining our allies from “unwise” action. The Secretary said that it had not been
              an easy task since both France and the United Kingdom feel that they cannot tolerate
                <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0167"/>the situation created by <persName

                Company.</note> and that they must react strongly or they will be “finished” as
              world powers. On Friday evening he had spoken of a “decent respect for the opinions of
              mankind” and while this remark was directed particularly at Egypt it also applies to
              the United Kingdom and France. The Secretary hoped that moderating influences would
              prevail at the Conference which has been called for August 16.</p>

                <p>“I think the Chancellor has been already somewhat ’straightened out’, but he is
                  particularly sensitive because he feels that he is risking his political life on a

                  opponents, and indeed many within his own party, seem to feel that this is

                  noted, among other things:</p>
                <p>“I then showed President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>

                  recalled that from the beginning he had taken the position that even though we had

                  their elimination. He read the draft reply. He pencilled a few suggested additions

              something of the dilemma in which the Free World is placed by Soviet intransigence and
              arrogance.</p>
            <p>You will recall that immediately after the end of the Second World War when the
              United States had a monopoly of atomic weapons we offered to give up that monopoly and
              to turn over to an international agency of the United Nations the entire control of
              the production and use of atomic energy so as to assure that it could not be used for
              destructive purposes. This proposal the Soviet Union rejected, being determined itself
              to develop this field of atomic missiles.</p>
            <p>The attitude thus expressed in 1946 has continuously been evident in our policies.
              You will recall that in December 1953, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                >Eisenhower</persName> made his “Atoms for Peace” proposal where he asked the
              Soviets to agree with us to put fissionable material in a world bank for peaceful
                purposes.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">For text of President <persName

              >Bulganin</persName>.</p>
            <p>We are earnestly studying further proposals that can be made, as pointed out by
              President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in his letter of August 4
              to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>.<note n="5"

                299–300.</note> We have not ceased, and never shall cease, to seek ways to meet the
              peril you refer to.</p>
            <p>If only the Soviets would accept the type of strict and thorough international
              control which we have repeatedly proposed, then many other things would readily
              follow. Here again the Soviet Union has been obdurate.</p>
            <p>For us to desist from making these new weapons on a one-sided basis would not
              contribute to the security of the Free World or to peace.</p>
            <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0169"/>
            <p>Surely we would not wish a situation to exist where the Soviet Union had preeminence
              in this field and could use that preeminence to dominate the world and impose its
              will. I cannot think of any worse fate than for the world to acquiesce in a situation
              where this vast power was in the hands of men who profess to be atheists and
              materialists, who accept no moral inhibitions of action which might seem to promote
              their power.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the United States is determined, unless and until there can be a
              dependable system of control, to maintain military power in these new weapons
              sufficient, we believe, to deter their use by the Soviet Union. In view of the
              rejection by Soviet leaders of moral restraints, these other deterrents must be
              provided.</p>
            <p>We recognize, as you say, that the mentality of the Soviet rulers is such that they
              would risk a war when the United States would never do so. But we are taking constant
              steps to assure that if they should do so, the first hour would not be decisive in
              their favor. The situation is such, and we are confident and determined that we can
              keep it such, that no initial strike could destroy our retaliatory power. And so long
              as that is the case, we believe that the Soviets will not strike.</p>
            <p>You say that the German Federal Republic will work with all its strength for a
              controlled disarmament in the field of nuclear weapons. I can assure you that we
              welcome this approach and we can in this matter stand side by side. I beg you,
              however, not to assume that this is an easy task. We have been through ten years of
              frustration. But we are still determined, and welcome your country as a comrade in
              this struggle.</p>
            <p>You suggest that the development of new weapons, and United States concentration upon
              maintaining a position of deterrence in this respect, is leading us too much to
              neglect conventional forces.</p>
            <p>It is, of course, true that our military establishment and disposition have
              constantly been adjusted and adapted over the last decade to take account of changing
              factors, including the changes in weapons and technology. President <persName
                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, in his press conference of August 8, had
              this to say:<note n="6" xml:id="d65fn6">For the transcript of

                <p>“There is a streamlining coming about. I don’t believe in talking of reduction
                  because when you are talking about defense forces you are talking about their
                  power, their effectiveness, their capability.</p>
                <p>“And the mere fact that now one man can shoot a machine gun at the rate of 700
                  rounds a minute, and it used to take in the flintlock days about 1400 men to get
                  off that many shots, it doesn’t mean you have had any reduction of power because
                  you have one man shooting them instead of 1400, does it?</p>

                <p>“Well, now, that is the kind of thing that we ought to apply intelligently as we
                  go along. Otherwise, we are being stupid, as I see it.”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>At the same time we have been constantly aware of the importance of maintaining
              flexible capability in responding to any aggression. We have maintained and will
              continue to maintain such capability.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, I cannot see in our program any basis for Europe losing confidence in
              the reliability of the United States.</p>
            <p>Never has any nation in history pursued so unswerving a course of enlightened
              unselfishness as has the United States during recent years. We have, contrary to our
              traditions and our instinctive desires, maintained a powerful military establishment,
              particularly since the Korean War showed that need. We have, through grants or loans,
              in the past decade given “foreign aid” in amounts which aggregate $50 or $60 billion.
              This year the Congress appropriated approximately $1 billion more for “foreign aid”
              than last year, and this was during an election year when such appropriations are
              intensely unpopular. We are at the present time dedicating more than 10 percent of our
              gross national production to our security arrangements, and this figure is more apt to
              increase than to decrease. We are now maintaining about 3 million people under arms
              under a two-year conscription law. We are committed by treaty to common defense with
              42 other nations of the world and there is no slightest evidence that we are not
              prepared to live up to our commitments.</p>
            <p>If all this adds up to “undependability”, I wonder how “dependability” should be
              measured; and also where it is to be found? Of course, we do not attempt to maintain
              in Europe, and in Asia, and in the Middle East, United States ground forces equal to
              any that could be thrown against these areas from the Soviet-Chinese land mass. For us
              to attempt that would be folly, and would add up not to strength but to weakness. We
              consider that our role is to maintain the strength which will deter open Soviet
              aggression in these areas. But such a deterrent would never be created if we scattered
              our strength all around the world, since we could not conceivably be strong enough at
              every point around the 25,000-mile orbit of the Soviet-Chinese Communist world to
              match its striking power. To attempt that would be folly.</p>
            <p>I do not believe for a moment that the need for ground forces has passed away. Recent
              developments in relation to the Suez reemphasize that point. What we face is a problem
              of sharing responsibilities. The United States can take, and is taking, the main
              burden of keeping ahead of the Soviet Union with respect to nonconventional weapons.
              This is a very heavy and expensive task indeed. We are <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143"
                facs="0171"/>also maintaining, and will maintain, a substantial ground force, But as
              we tarry the part of the task which seems most appropriate for us, should not the free
              countries of Europe and Asia, with their large reserves of manpower, carry the part of
              the task most appropriate for them? A particular responsibility, I feel, devolves upon
              the “divided” countries, because they can be subjected to so-called “civil war”, as
              was attempted in Korea. Both the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Vietnam are
              responding to this responsibility and I believe that you are eternally right in urging
              upon your country that it also should respond. If it should fail to do so, then your
              great nation would, I feel, be lacking in its indispensable contribution to the common
              cause.</p>
            <p>This letter is written in a very personal and spontaneous way. It is not an official
              pronouncement of my Government, but it reflects my deep personal convictions and is
              written as a friend to a friend whom I deeply respect and admire. You may be sure that
              both the President and I constantly pray for the strength and wisdom to deal with the

            <p>Seated next to each other at dinner last night, we had a rather animated conversation
              on the subject of US military dispositions. Von Brentano said that it was very
              embarrassing to get these reports in the press, and particularly when the Chancellor
              had recently been in the US and had heard nothing of any such plans.</p>
            <p>I said that there were no plans in the sense in which Von Brentano spoke. At this
              time of year when the future budgets were being estimated, each branch of the services
              made its plans based upon its own concept of its role in a future war. Usually the
              Army, the Navy and the Air Force each assumed that it alone could win the war and that
              it alone needed large sums. These were unbalanced positions <pb n="144"
                xml:id="pg_144" facs="0172"/>generally prepared in the first instance by junior
              officers; all of them finally came together and only then did they begin to take on
              any official status. The reports that had alarmed the Germans had emanated from a
              study which reflected the views of one branch of the services. It was utterly
              impossible that we should communicate such reports to foreign governments. As a matter
              of fact I myself knew nothing of them and paid no attention to them at that level. Nor
              of course did the President. I could assure Von Brentano that when it came to taking
              decisions at the high level which would materially affect US military disposition,
              none would be taken having a major impact upon Germany without prior consultation with
              the German Government.</p>
            <p>Von Brentano said that for the first time he understood the situation, that what I
              said was very reassuring and would enable them to deal better with their own political
              situation where the newspaper studies were given full credence as definitive
                decisions.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2"><p>On August 24, <persName>Dulles</persName>
                  drafted another memorandum of this conversation:</p>
                <p>“Last night at dinner Von Brentano said his information was that the Germans did
                  want to buy all their tanks from the US, but he could not yet say this on the
                  personal authority of the Chancellor, whom he expected to see as soon as he got
                  back to Germany, but that he was confident that would be the decision.”

                  German forces. I replied you had dealt with these matters in your letters, etc. I

                  than direct Soviet intervention. Latter situation would create new conditions
                  where our growing retaliatory power could play its role. I also pointed out that
                  review of events of past few years showed that even if we had had twice the amount
                  of conventional forces now available, our policies and actions would not have been

                <persName>Dollinger</persName>’s appreciation for the opportunity to come to the
              United States under the exchange program and emphasized the value of such visits to
              international understanding. He said that he and Dr. <persName>Dollinger</persName>
              had arrived in the United States five weeks ago. At that time the situation was
              somewhat tense because of the public debate regarding military matters. He wished to
              inform the Secretary that he was completely satisfied with the conversations which he
              had had in the State Department and that he was returning to Europe with a sense of
              calmness with regard to these matters. He understood that adjustments in military
              planning were being considered, but that this was only natural and involved no basic
              change in policy. He was satisfied that as regards conventional weapons the people in
              Europe could be entirely calm.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">No other records of Krone’s
                conversations have been found in Department of State files.</note></p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> said that he had not, of course, seen the Chancellor
              during this time, but that he could imagine the Chancellor was somewhat upset. He
              hoped that his visit in the United States would enable him to allay the Chancellor’s
              apprehensions. He pointed out <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0178"/>that, as the
              Secretary knew, there would be an election in Germany next year. The <persName
                corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democratic Party had maintained its unity and
              had secured the enactment of laws for the establishment of military forces in the face
              of strong efforts by the opposition. At the present time public opinion polls appeared
              to indicate an unfavorable sentiment toward the Government. All these matters were, of
              course, linked.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he realized a certain amount of emotional and intellectual
              disturbance had been aroused by articles which had emanated from Washington about two
              months before. He recalled that when he had seen Foreign Minister Brentano in London
              the previous week, the latter said it had made things very difficult for him and the
              Chancellor not to have known of these articles in advance. The Secretary replied that
              he thought it inappropriate that the German Foreign Minister be informed before the
              American Foreign Minister. They both learned of the articles at the same time and in
              the same manner. The Secretary said that when the United States budget was being made
              up and the services were all fighting for a larger share in the budget, all sorts of
              plans were made at the lower level and stories appear in the press as to what is
              proposed. He said he never paid much attention to these stories, nor did the
              President. However, he could easily understand the concern which they had caused in
              Germany. He knew the stories were not true, whereas the Germans had not known
              this.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that with regard to the substance of the matter, the United States
              is making and will continue to make a very great effort toward military preparedness.
              It is devoting approximately 11 per cent of its gross national product to various
              military purposes. There has been no suggestion that Germany should do as much. The
              United States has approximately three million of its citizens under arms, which
              represents about 2 percent of our population. This number may vary somewhat, but will
              not vary greatly. There was no suggestion that Germany should make a comparable
              contribution in military manpower. The term of military service in the United States
              is two years. There has been no suggestion that it should be more than 18 months in
              Germany. The Secretary said that he could not see, under these circumstances, how it
              could be suggested that the Chancellor was asking the German people to undertake more
              than a minimum share of the burden of defense.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said people asked what kind of a war one must prepare for. He thought
              that no one in the world could answer this question. The British had been thinking of
              placing greater emphasis on atomic weapons. Then the Suez crisis had arisen, which
              required infantry, landing craft and ships. The answer was that the tasks must be
              divided. The primary responsibility of the United States was to <pb n="151"
                xml:id="pg_151" facs="0179"/>stay ahead of the Soviet Union in the field of atomic:
              arms and their means of delivery. He said this was an American responsibility, since
              the United States is the only country with the technical ability to do so and which
              can bear the costs. However, the United States was going to do more than this. It
              would continue to maintain extensive ground forces and naval forces. He believed
              Germany had a duty, as a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to provide a
              substantial contribution to the conventional forces needed to deter war or in the
              event of war. He thought that Germany had a particular responsibility as a divided
              country in which there was a greater risk of war which would be called not
              international, but civil. There are two countries in the same situation, Korea and
              Vietnam. Both the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Vietnam carry much greater
              defense burdens than it has been suggested Germany carry.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he made these remarks with no intent of criticism of the
              Chancellor and his party, for whom he had great respect, but in the hope that an
              understanding of our position would help Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> and Dr.
                <persName>Dollinger</persName> to make it clear to the German people. He knew how
              difficult it is to get understanding of these matters in Germany, as in Japan. The
              cruel experiences which these nations suffered in the last war have understandably led
              to feelings of pacifism and neutrality. However, he was certain that the real interest
              of the Federal Republic lay in making a substantial contribution to the varied forces
              needed so that war can be deterred by making it clear that no kind of war can be
              successful.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> thanked the Secretary for his statement and said that
              both he and Dr. <persName>Dollinger</persName> were in agreement with what the
              Secretary had said. They agreed with regard to the treaties and their implementation.
              He said that there was full agreement in the coalition and in the Government. He
              appreciated the Secretary’s remarks with regard to Korea and Vietnam and the
              possibility of a war involving conventional methods. He said that he would be seeing
              the Chancellor and hoped that he could express to him the Secretary’s desire for even
              greater understanding between the United States and Germany.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he could. He believed there was no need to assure the
              Chancellor of the high respect and confidence which the Secretary has for him and of
              our feeling that so long as he is leading the German people or that his policies were
              being followed, the Federal Republic would undertake a fair share of the
              responsibility for the defense of the free world.</p>

            <p>The President received Dr Krone and Mr. <persName>Dollinger</persName> for about half
              an hour, both parties speaking through an interpreter.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> summarized the favorable impressions of his trip
              across the US. He mentioned the talks he had had with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AS1"

                  >Adams</persName> has been found in Department of State files.</note> which were
              of a very reassuring nature regarding US strategic intentions in Europe. An election
              would be held next year in Germany and it was important there be a satisfactory
              understanding of the US position. Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> thanked the President
              for receiving him and Mr. <persName>Dollinger</persName>, saying this would help
              support Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s policies.</p>
            <p>The President said he was glad to know this, since he especially admired Dr.
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> as a great European and a great
              statesman. The President stressed that the first objective of the US was peace and he
              could not imagine how any intelligent German—and most of them were intelligent—could
              choose the East against the West.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> agreed but observed that in German politics it was not
              so much a matter of a choice between the two—since almost every German was on the side
              of the West—but a choice of means to achieve objectives. The Social Democratic
              opposition were not Communists but they pursued their objectives along lines which
              supported the Russians.</p>
            <p>The President said he understood Dr. <persName>Krone</persName>’s remarks but it was
              clear that the actions by some Germans could be interpreted as helping the
              Communists.</p>
            <p>The President then said he would like to talk more about exchange programs generally,
              like the one on which Dr. <persName>Krone</persName> and Mr. <pb n="153"
                xml:id="pg_153" facs="0181"/> Dollinger had visited the US. During the war he had
              subscribed to the idea of universal German guilt, but shortly after the war his
              acquaintance with German individuals quickly persuaded him that Germans were about
              like other people and many of them had been the victims of letting one man seize
              power. He mentioned that he and General Clay had been criticized by some Americans who
              had wished to “pastoralize” Germany and flood the Ruhr mines.</p>
            <p>Continuing, the President pointed out the Communists made Russians lie and falsify in
              the interests of the state. He on the other hand greatly favored real understanding
              through travel and friendship. The only private benefit to which he had agreed to lend
              his name was the <persName>Eisenhower</persName> Exchange Fellowship Program which
              enabled young foreign businessmen and executives to visit and work here for a year or
              so. The President said there was some advantage in having more mature people take part
              in an exchange, since they had an interest in returning to homes and jobs in their own
              country, as was not always so in the case of students.</p>
            <p>The interview ended on a friendly exchange concerning the role played by persons of
              German origin in this country and the President asked Dr. <persName>Krone</persName>
              to transmit his regards to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
              >Adenauer</persName>.</p>

                telephoned Conant to ask whether he would accept an appointment as Ambassador to
                India. Conant had been surprised and “his first reaction was strongly negative,” but
                he said he would consider the matter further and discuss it again when he returned
                to Washington. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note></head>

            <p>We discussed the status of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and his
              viewpoint and apparent misunderstanding of many of the present problems. I reported to
              Ambassador Conant the talks which I had had with Foreign Minister Von Brentano and
              with Dr. <persName>Krone</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref target="#d66"
                  >Documents 66</ref> and <ref target="#d68">68</ref>.</note> Ambassador Conant said
              that obviously <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was getting a lot of
              misinformation and that he, Conant, was quite shocked by <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName>’s letter to me.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Conant then referred to the suggestion that he should go as Ambassador to
              India and expressed again his regret that he had felt compelled to indicate his
              unavailability. He said he was <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>planning to
              get back here for work with foundations, etc., around the first of the year and asked
              about what would be desired in the timing of his resignation. I said I thought he
              should follow the usual procedure and put in his resignation after the November
              election. It would then be acted upon in due course with a view probably to an actual
              change early in January. Ambassador Conant said that that would fit in very well with
              his personal plans.</p>

              continues to be a major objective of American foreign policy. The Secretary said that

              elections play no great role and there was no doubt but that the President would be
              reelected. In the opinion of the Chancellor, the election constitutes a handicap for
              President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and the Republican
              party.</p>
            <p>Then the Chancellor gave some highly confidential information on a resolution of the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Standing Group taken on September 5 or 6. A
              spokesman of the Standing Group had declared before the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> Council that the previous intention to pursue the so-called “forward
              strategy” in case of a Soviet attack could no longer be maintained after the
              withdrawal of the French and British troops and <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156"
                facs="0184"/>that the defense points would be moved back to the Rhein and the
              Ijssel. This means a complete declaration of bankruptcy by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss>. If this fact should become known, it would have an extremely crushing
              effect in Europe and particularly in Germany. During the discussion of this plan by
              the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadors, it was learned that two
              Ambassadors, the American and the Greek, were without instructions from their
              Governments. According to information given by Mr. <persName>Blankenhorn</persName>,
              the American Ambassador to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> frequently was
              without information or instructions from his Government. For example, the nomination
              of Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> was announced to the press
              but not to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> himself so that he was
              forced to state that he did not know whether or not he was Ambassador to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
            <p>The reason for his remarks were to show that only the United States could assume the
              leadership of the Free World and that if it did not maintain this leadership, then
              that is the end.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor then spoke of news which he had received the previous day (Sept. 9)
              according to which a subcommittee of the American Senate for Disarmament had heard 75
              individuals, the majority of whom expressed the opinion that the armament of the
              Federal Republic increased tension and would make an international agreement on
              disarmament difficult. This appears in an interim report of the Committee which was
              published in Washington on the weekend. All the persons who appeared before the
              Committee favored a cessation of experiments with atomic and hydrogen bombs on the
              basis of an international agreement. The witnesses supported the view of the American
              Government according to which disarmament should only be accomplished step by step,
              but at the same time they recommended that the United States should pursue a
              unilateral policy of disarmament in case an international disarmament agreement could
              not be reached in the near future.</p>
            <p>As a third point, the Chancellor named the differences of opinion concerning the Suez
              which exist between the United States, England and France. If the three aforementioned
              facts are considered together, it is not too much to say that it is all over with
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This is a serious situation and the Soviet
              Union is thereby rendered the best possible service. The report on the reduction of
              armed forces is completely destroying <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s
              policy.</p>
            <p>He sees as the reason for these events the fact that American politicians and also
              numerous members of the American Government are not able to comprehend what a
              dictator, a dictatorial regime, and especially a communistic regime mean. In America,
              the belief appears to prevail that if one treats another person decently the other
              person must for his part also conduct himself decently. Germans have had experience
              with dictatorship and know that meeting a person half way is always regarded as a sign
              of weakness. For this reason, the <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0185"/>danger is
              so great and the entire work which the United States has in the past, thank God,
              accomplished, threatens to be destroyed.</p>
            <p>If the Mollet Government should fall, the only alternatives would be a dictatorship
              or a popular front. Mollet is an excellent man and <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> himself does not know what would become of France if Mollet
              should fall. Such a development would then extend to Italy where the Nenni- and
              Saragat-Socialists are already close together. If Mollet should fall, <persName
                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> would also fall at the same time.</p>
            <p>Under these conditions, it is impossible for him to succeed in introducing a period
              of military service of 18 months; and if the Federal Republic does not introduce this,
              all other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> States would eliminate their 18-month
              period of service. The only way out which he sees is to introduce a 12-month period of
              service for certain branches of the armed forces and an 18-month period for others. He
              could perhaps also say that he must discuss the question again with experts in the
              Defense Ministry, but the planning now is for a 12-month period of service coupled
              with two or three month periods of training in succeeding years.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> then responded to the remarks of the Chancellor and
              referred to the report of the Senate Committee which he had not seen. He pointed out
              that there are many people in the American Government with very different views, that
              this is an election year, and that the opposition party constitutes a majority of the
              Senate. Regrettable though it is, it is necessary to take into account that the Senate
              will express views which are not in accord with the Government.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> assured the Chancellor that President <persName
                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary
              of Defense do not share the views presented in this report. He is certain that
              everyone who occupies a responsible political position would accept the validity of
              the statements by the Chancellor concerning the seriousness of the situation, the
              unreliability of a dictatorship, and the necessity to remain firm. The United States
              is determined to remain firm. This determination is given its expression in its
              military progress and in the defense budget, which are constantly becoming greater. In
              this regard, the United States is motivated by the desire to strengthen its own
              position and, at the same time, to help its Allies strengthen their positions. Mr.
                <persName>Quarles</persName> further assured the Chancellor that both political
              parties support these efforts. With regard to the defense budget, there had been
              differences of opinion, but the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 was
              greater than that for the previous year and, although the budget for the following
              year has not yet been fixed, he is of the firm belief that this will be larger than
              the present one.</p>
            <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>
            <p>The United States now finds itself in the midst of a revolution of its military
              structure which is based on the development of atomic weapons. In this connection, the
              Army, Navy and Air Force are affected. As a result of the development of these
              weapons, through the great increase in strength, speed and cruising range of modern
              planes as well as the application of the most modern electrical equipment for the use
              and control of these planes, the fire power and striking power of the individual
              soldier has been substantially increased. With the further development of fire power,
              consideration is being given to an appropriate reduction in the strength of the
              personnel.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor again referred to the interim report of the Senate Committee to which
              the American Ambassador replied this involved personal views of the witnesses, who are
              not experts.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> then mentioned two fundamental principles of the
              American defense position. In the first place, it is a matter of keeping the border of
              the Free World strong enough so that a Soviet or communistic aggression would have to
              be massive enough in order to overcome the power of the Free World which has been
              built up on its border. However, if a Soviet aggression were so massive, then the
              intention underlying this would be clear, and if it were clearly established that the
              Soviet Union planned to undertake such a massive aggression, then the United States is
              determined to respond to this wherever necessary with all of the strength at its
              disposal. It is therefore a question of maintaining the periphery strong enough in
              order that the intention of the opponent will be revealed in case of an attack.</p>
            <p>The second principle is that one must have sufficient retaliatory power so that any
              aggression would a priori constitute a risk for the opponent. He believed that if the
              Free World stands firm on the periphery and if it maintains the possibility of waging
              a massive retaliatory blow against the Soviet Union once its intention to begin a
              massive aggression has become known, then this serves as a deterrent which will keep
              the Russians from even thinking about aggression. Of course, it is known that the
              Soviets are attempting to expand their sphere of influence through subversive
              activity, infiltration and economic warfare. He believed, however, that the United
              States together with the Federal Republic and all of its other Allies is strong enough
              and that the system of the Free World is good enough to counter this danger. If the
              Russians can be prevented from resorting to massive aggression, then in his opinion it
              would also prove possible to protect the system of the Free World against the evil
              system of communism.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor responded to Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName>’ remarks as follows: To
              be sure, nuclear weapons and deterrents must be placed in the hands of the Army. It is
              also correct to say that the fire power of the <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"
              />individual soldier is much greater than before. If it should ever be possible to
              fire nuclear shells from conventional cannons, then it would be possible to think of a
              reduction in the armed forces. But this should not be suggested until the situation
              has progressed so far, that is, before nuclear munitions are developed to such an
              extent that they could, for example, be fired from conventional cannons and their
              effectiveness reduced to a smaller radius. The article which appeared in the <hi
                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> concerning the reduction of the American armed
              forces by 800,000 men would mean that all bases outside the United States would have
              to be given up.</p>
            <p>The Soviet Union is living on the hope of disunity in the West. Therefore, everything
              must be avoided which nourishes this hope. The Chancellor recalled his conversations
              with <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName>, in which the question of whether the West could stick
              together played a decisive role. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
              openly admitted that because of armament, social burdens have become so pressing that
              they wish to reduce their armaments. Now, for example, if the proposal is made that
              the United States disarm unilaterally, the position of the Russians in power would
              thereby be strengthened although great dissatisfaction exists in their own land. The
              Chancellor saw only one possibility, namely, that the Russians must not be given a
              respite.</p>
            <p>In so far as the development of pilotless aircraft, nuclear weapons and guided
              missiles is concerned, the Soviet Union will also one day reach a point when it will
              be able to project such missiles onto the United States. A dictator is always more
              ready to use such a method without a declaration of war than a democratic statesman.
              The Soviet Union would therefore have an advantage over the United States because it
              could utilize such weapons suddenly. Hitler, for example, did not recognize the
              concept of law and international law. He had no conscience, and the only thing which
              counted for him was power. Therefore, the Chancellor saw in the present development a
              serious danger for the United States.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> informed the Chancellor that the United States is
              already able to use atomic shells of the type which the Chancellor mentioned. This is
              particularly true for the Army and the Air Force. Such weapons could be utilized by
              tactical aircraft or with rockets or could be fired from conventional cannons. Weapons
              of this kind exist in various sizes so that their usage can be adapted to the
              appropriate target in a particular theater of action. These weapons are now ready for
              use. It is practically a question of advanced conventional weapons.</p>
            <p>In so far as the reduction of forces by 800,000 men is concerned, stated Mr.
                <persName>Quarles</persName>, this was a matter of a staff proposal which was
              prepared for discussion by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This plan had neither the
              approval of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160"
                facs="0188"/>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, nor had it
              been officially presented to the Government. In working out the draft paper, the
              question under study was an examination of how the strength of the forces could be
              adjusted to the constantly increasing costs which arise from equipping the individual
              soldier with the newest weapons. In view of the increased costs and the accompanying
              increase in striking power, one could not maintain the same number of soldiers under
              arms. It was therefore a question of establishing a balance between these two factors,
              whereby Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> explicitly pointed out that there is a
              tendency toward a constant increase in the total expenditures for military
              purposes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> believed that the Russians are genuinely interested
              in disarmament and reduction of costs since they are spending a greater portion of
              their national income for armament than the United States, and this must constitute a
              substantial burden. Everything that the Russians had done thus far in the field of
              disarmament, nevertheless, is of little value with regard to modern weapon technique
              and he doubted the sincerity of their intentions. He is convinced that the strength of
              the Free World depends upon its solidarity and he attached particular importance to a
              continuation of this solidarity with the Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor replied that the fact must be taken into account that some day the
              Russians will also be in a position to deliver modern weapons on the U.S. They are
              already in such a position. In the event that the Russians undertake a major
              aggression, it is believed that they would begin with a massive air attack on the U.S.
              in order to destroy the centers of American striking power in their own land. It is
              not expected, for example, that the Soviets would set their land forces into motion in
              the direction of the Rhine because they would thereby betray their aggressive
              intentions toward America and would thereby renounce the possibility of a surprise
              attack on the United States.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor believed that in the light of the present-day strategic situation, the
              statements of the Standing Group do not have too great significance.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor observed that this statement had not failed to make an impression and
              that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had thereby been weakened. One could even
              say that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would then be superfluous.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> interjected that the view expressed in this
              statement was not in accord with the thinking of the Defense Ministry in Washington
              since in its opinion it is not reasonable.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor continued that if one said that the Soviet Union would not undertake a
              local aggression because it feared retaliatory blows, then the question arises why
              German forces should be raised. Furthermore, account must be taken of the fact that
              such local aggression could be started not only by the Russians but also by satellite
                <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>states. The United States would also think
              over the situation several times before it determined to utilize its entire atomic
              force.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> again referred to the two basic principles of the
              American defense position. Strength on the periphery can only be created when the
              German armed forces are strong enough to oppose attacks by guerrilla forces of the
              East Zone. It is necessary to make a distinction between guerrilla activity and a
              massive Soviet aggression. Strong German forces are indispensable if one is to oppose
              all aggressions which are less than a massive attack of the entire East Bloc.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor observed that in such a major conflict the first hour would be
              decisive and he feared, for the previously mentioned reasons, that the Soviets would
              have the advantage.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Quarles</persName> disagreed with this. The Americans, in their
              planning, are prepared to grant the Soviets the advantage of the first blow since they
              believe they have achieved such a strong position that it would be possible to wage a
              decisive retaliatory blow, despite a surprise attack, which would make any massive
              Russian aggression a risk. Therefore, not the first day but the first week is
              decisive.</p>
            <p>The conversation ended at 1:25 p.m.</p>

              Europe so long as the presence is agreeable to the Germans and to the rest of the
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> group. The Chancellor thanked him for the
              statement and emphasized it would be most helpful to him if there could be a press
              release. He said it was not so much he himself who was disturbed by the issue but
              public opinion. Europe after the wars, [because of?] Germany’s Nazi experience, etc.,
              was spiritually unstable. Public opinion must be carefully handled. He wished to give
              an example of the instability of public opinion. His party had an absolute majority.
              In July his party had supported 18 months as length military service. As result press
              reports from the United States everybody is now for 12 months. His military advisers
              assured him that the striking power of force built on a 12 months compulsory service
              would be as great or greater than the force contemplated at 18 months service. The
              Cabinet yesterday approved 12 months service but it had made an adjustment in a
              percentage of volunteers and draftees composing the forces in such a way that the
              force would remain as strong as previously contemplated. His military advisers
              actually preferred the 12 months service with the adjustment in a percentage of
              volunteers serving for longer period but he wished to use this as an example of the
              spiritual instability. He referred again to the fact that in July all but 3 members of
              his party had favored 18 months.</p>
            <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> stated that there might be a
              streamlining or screening of our forces but that there would not be a reduction in
              force. The streamlining or screening might lead to an additional division. He wished
              to assure the Chancellor of our strong belief in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              as a military screen behind which the free world could breathe. Germany was the great
              windward anchor of the alliance. We regretted as the Germans did the fact that the
              French had to be drawn off into Algiers and the Suez now created a problem with
              respect to the British forces. Immediate impression was bad but in the long run effect
              on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might be solidity. He knew and could speak of
              the basic feeling of the Senate and was convinced of the basic underlying intention to
              strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The military strength was the first
              essential of the alliance but we were hoping to improve <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> in political and economic consultation and by finding some means of
              eliminating disputes.</p>
            <p>This was the message he particularly wished to bring to the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>Chancellor said he was happy for the statement and thanked the Senator. There was a
              certain erroneous impression abroad in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which
              arose in the following manner: The United States <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              Ambassador <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0191"/>was often without instructions and
              this created the impression of diminishing interest on the part of the United States
              in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which had its influence on other governments.
              Chancellor did not wish to be critical but to state the facts. The U.S. Government in
              Washington did not adequately inform and instruct its <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> Ambassador. He was pleased that the Senator had been appointed to his
              position as he could not be bypassed whether in Washington or Paris.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d73fn3">Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName>, Chairman of
                the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was designated by the President to attend
                the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings in Paris. <persName
                  corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> also visited the Federal Republic of Germany
                and Italy before returning to the United States.</note> Senator <persName
                corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> stated he understood and appreciated the fact
              that Washington’s coordination was sometimes loose with its very capable and able
              Ambassador in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. (As this was translated to the
              Chancellor he broke in to say that he wanted to emphasize that he was not critical of
              Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName>, that if <persName
                corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> didn’t have instruction he couldn’t act as
              though he did.) Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> continued
              looseness of coordination was not a real indication of any lack of interest.</p>
            <p>Chancellor stated there was an absolute necessity for closer and better
              coordination.</p>
            <p>Senator continued that he would not want to say anything to the press unless the
              Chancellor approved. He would not want to make any statement which could be
              misunderstood and he would wish to discuss it with the Ambassador first.</p>
            <p>Chancellor said such a statement would be very favorable for his policies.</p>
            <p>After a further exchange of courtesies the Senator took leave of the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>The Embassy believes that failure for the Senator to make any statement would result
              in the Chancellor leaking something much stronger.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, Senator and Ambassador have agreed to following statement which has been
              cleared by Eckhardt and released.</p>

            <p>Ambassador Krekeler called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> at

                668–671.</note> The Ambassador said he was glad of this opportunity because he had
              just received instructions from his government to explain the German position
              regarding the reported decision by the German Government to support a 12 month period
              of military service in lieu of 18 months. There was some discussion regarding
              Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s reaction to the spate of
              newspaper stories which began in June concerning the so-called “<persName
                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> Plan”. Ambassador Krekeler referred to
              Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s conversation with the
              Secretary in June<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">See <ref target="#d55">Document
                55</ref>.</note> at which time no intimation was given to the Chancellor of an
              impending reduction of American military forces. The Ambassador stated that the
              unexpected batch of sensational press stories on this subject came at a most
              inopportune moment because of the internal German political situation and that the
              Chancellor felt it necessary to protect his position because had he not acted on the
              question of German military service, his entire position might have been undermined.
              The Ambassador said in strictest confidence that he wanted the Secretary to know that
              the Chancellor was having difficulties within his own party, especially the Bavarian
              element. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> told the Ambassador that he
              appreciated the Chancellor’s difficulties but what he found regrettable was that in
              special references to the matter the Chancellor had found it necessary to depend on
              newspaper reports. This might create the impression that German-American relations
              were not as close and friendly on a Governmental plane as they should be. The
              Ambassador said he appreciated this point and suggested that Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> talk quite frankly about it to the Chancellor
              when he saw him in Bonn.</p>
            <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0193"/>
            <p>The Ambassador said that he would like to personally explain to the Secretary the
              advice he had received from his Government concerning its decision to apply a 12 month
              rule to military service. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that
              the Secretary was not in the building at the moment and he thought perhaps he was
              engaged for the balance of the morning in meetings at his residence. The Ambassador
              said Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Eleanor Dulles</persName> had assured him the
              Secretary would be available. The Secretary received the Ambassador at his residence
              at 12:30 p.m.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador briefly outlined the reasons leading to the German decision to apply a
              12 month rule to military service. He said that he hoped that this action would be
              understood in its proper light in the United States. The Secretary expressed
              appreciation for the Ambassador’s explanation.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Under instructions Mr. <persName>Krekeler</persName> presented the attached
                aide-mémoire;<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">Not printed; it expressed the hope that the
                U.N. General Assembly would adopt a resolution urging the termination of the present
                situation in Germany in order to facilitate German reunification “in
                freedom”.</note> he solicited the Secretary’s comments and support, should he
              approve. The Ambassador mentioned that wording of point (a) referring to the “failure
              of the occupying powers to fulfill their legal obligations to restore Germany’s unity”
              was unfortunate and of course was meant to refer to the USSR only.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said the general idea in the proposal was good but the details might
              lead to difficulties. He recalled that the Austrian question had been referred to the
              UN and although the successful outcome could not be traced to the UN, action by the
              General Assembly was nevertheless useful in keeping the question to the forefront.
              However, Austria was less complicated than Germany and the composition of the General
              Assembly is now less dependable from our standpoint. The Secretary said it would be
              necessary to go through the membership list to see whether a two-thirds majority
              favorable to our ideas could be counted upon. He also had in mind the <pb n="166"
                xml:id="pg_166" facs="0194"/>situation in Committees of the Assembly where
              mischievous amendments might be carried by majority vote; a two-thirds majority in the
              Assembly itself was required for adoption of a resolution.</p>
            <p>Respecting the sponsoring countries proposed in the aide-mémoire, the Secretary said
              India with its neutralist ideas would probably not be helpful, despite the point made
              by Mr. <persName>Krekeler</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>
              had gained experience during his visit in Bonn.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3"><persName
                  corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> visited Bonn July 13–16 for discussions with
                West German officials.</note> The Secretary advised lining up countries in free
              world security organizations, with an Asian country, either Thailand or Pakistan,
              adding perhaps Austria.</p>
            <p>The Secretary emphasized the importance of working out details, reiterating the risk
              of amendments. Germany and the Western countries must be able to count on majorities
              in Committee to defeat such amendments, also the Chairman of the Committee would be
              important. Presumably the question would go to either Committee I or the Ad Hoc
              Committee of the Assembly.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he was quite prepared to consider the German proposal
              sympathetically but we should be sure that we would be able to come out with a
              desirable result. He did not wish to give a definite opinion now but said we would
              study the problem.</p>
            <p>The Secretary and the Ambassador speculated on some of the countries who would be
              favorable, including the following: a majority of the American Republics; presumably
              most of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; 5 or 6 Asian countries; the total
              amounting to about 40 votes. The Baghdad Pact countries might also be added. Out of
              the total UN membership of 76, about 52 favorable votes would be needed. However,
              there would be many marginal countries and some of them would be unpredictable.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Krekeler</persName> agreed that hard calculation was needed and he
              looked to the Secretary for advice because of his experience in the UN. He promised to
              report the Secretary’s views to the German Government.</p>
            <p>The Secretary indicated that the Department would be glad to go over the question
              further after the German Embassy has heard from Bonn.</p>

              <p>“The change in American strategic thinking—a change which is due to election
                politics—has caused deep concern in Bonn. For months the West German politicians
                have been emphatically told by the highest authorities of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss> and by traveling military men from beyond the Atlantic Ocean that
                twelve German divisions are absolutely necessary and essential for the defense of
                Germany and of Europe; well-founded arguments, considerable evidence were offered
                for these claims. The Federal Government passed a conscription law to carry out its
                promise and to fulfill its defense obligations. The last echo of the bitter
                Parliamentary fight concerning this conscription law has hardly died out and the ink
                is hardly dry on the agreement concerning the support costs for allied troops, which
                Bonn conceded voluntarily, without any legal obligation. Now we hear from Washington
                a message from the military men, which was seconded by Secretary of State <persName
                  corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, that these twelve divisions will probably not
                be needed and that American troops are to be reduced in numbers. At the same time,
                it is reported that London is considering reducing troops stationed in the Federal
                Republic.</p>
              <p>“The man who based his policy to such a high degree on the assurance and the
                loyalty of his Western partners must today have the painful feeling of having been
                disavowed. When one considers this policy, it is difficult, at the present moment,
                to keep from writing a bitter satire about the coordination of Western policy.”</p>

              Political situation here in Germany has made it extremely difficult Chancellor to put
              through 18-month proposal and undoubtedly news and discussions in newspapers July 16
              to July 25 increased his difficulties. As explained to you in my personal letter in
                July,<note n="5" xml:id="d76fn5"><ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> the
              case for 12 division German army has been based largely on <persName

              British, American, and French strength on continent could forward position be held.
              Therefore, what appeared to be reversal in this position on part of U.S., and was
              certainly an official doubt raised by British on or about July 20 by document read to
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, has been serious blow to Chancellor’s

              German draft which in turn will bring forth further criticisms from U.S. and <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners. Chancellor and his friends will be inclined
              to blame U.S. still further for alleged change in strategic planning and failure to
              notify him at time of his visit to Washington last June.</p>

            </list>
            <p>The replacement of Blank by <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> as German
              Defense Minister has precipitated widespread speculation that the German Government
              may revise its plans for providing a defense force of 500,000 men in the form and on
              the schedule submitted to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the 1955 Annual
              Review. This schedule envisaged a three-year buildup for the Army, and four years for
              the Navy and Air Force, beginning in 1956.</p>
            <p>Our Embassy at Bonn was assured by Dr. <persName>Krone</persName>, <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> leader in the Bundestag, that the <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> is determined to abide by its commitment to raise
              500,000 men. Other statements have been reported, attributed to the Chancellor and his
              immediate staff, which deny that a change in government policy in this regard has
              taken place.</p>
            <p>The German 1956 Annual Review submission, however, disclosed financial plans which
              envisaged a slippage in equipment deliveries for the German buildup of one to two
              years. We have recently been informed that the German Government will shortly amend
              its submission to revise downward the interim manpower targets to approximately 80,000
              instead of 96,000 by the end of 1956 and to between 175,000 and 200,000 instead of
              270,000 by the end of 1957. This has been attributed to a shortage of
              accommodations.</p>
            <p>Apart from the slippage in time which seems almost certain, there remains a question
              as to whether the Germans will in fact create forces of the order of magnitude
              envisaged by their present force goals. While the German Government continues to
              maintain formally its position that the buildup will be achieved, the fact that the
              initial increment of the buildup is limited to only part of the 12 division total
              means that they are not, by reason of expenditures, as yet committed in fact to the
              full buildup.</p>
            <p>The recent spate of newspaper speculation arising out of the <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> appointment reveals the extent of the
              sentiment against achievement of the German force goals which exists in Germany. Not
              only is there little enthusiasm for creating a military force, but a definite
              hostility to the idea by some segments of public opinion.</p>
            <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0198"/>
            <p>The factors militating against a full German buildup can be summarized as follows:
              (1) disillusionment over Germany’s experience during the war; (2) lack of belief in an
              immediate Soviet threat, coupled with a fear that the creation of German forces and
              German membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> constitute a bar to
              reunification; (3) questions as to whether the forces projected for the German
              buildup, which are the same as those envisaged in 1951, are really necessary in the
              light of the development of new weapons; (4) concern that the cost of the projected
              forces will impair the ability of the Federal Republic to carry out necessary social
              welfare programs; (5) difficulty of initiating a substantial draft during an election
              year.</p>
            <p>The <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> appointment of itself does not
              provide an answer to the question. In general, we must expect as a result of the
              atmosphere of an election year and of the attitude of <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName>, a more national-minded approach to German defense planning.
                <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> is less wedded to the idea of
              adherence to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> schedules than was Blank, which may
              result in additional slippage in meeting agreed goals. More important, he apparently
              is inclined to question the composition and numbers of the German forces under the
              agreed force goals, advocating emphasis on new weapons, in particular, atomic weapons,
              and apparently leaning to 300,000 rather than 500,000 men. He may be expected to be
              more independent of the Chancellor than Blank was in the conduct of his Ministry, as
              he was in atomic affairs and also probably more effective. However, it is probably too
              early to forecast how his views will develop once he has fully assumed the
              responsibilities of his new office. It is reported that the Chancellor has received
                <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName>’ written assurance that he will
              carry out the Chancellor’s policy of a 500,000 man army. The next six months may
              disclose the trend of German planning from statements which they may make to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, from the pattern of their equipment purchases, and
              from the way in which they handle the training of men brought into the forces.</p>
            <p>The form of the German defense contribution is of primary importance to the future
              course of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to the defensive posture of the
              Western Powers; but it is clear that in Germany this question is increasingly becoming
              involved with domestic political issues. Even though the election will not be held
              until September 1957, the campaign is already under way and is dominating all other
              considerations. We have been active in urging the German Government to fulfill its
              original buildup plans and we should continue to exert our influence in <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and elsewhere as appropriate to this end.</p>
            <p>The political situation in Germany requires that our pressures be applied with
              appropriate caution and restraint in order to avoid a reaction that might prove
              counterproductive and to the end that <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0199"
              />progress in the defense buildup continues to carry us beyond the difficult period of
              the election.</p>

            <p>1826. In conversation with Foreign Minister Von Brentano last night he stated that in
              his opinion a treaty on <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> might be signed by
              Christmas and the 6 nations involved would then be in a position to ask the United
              States for the favorable arrangements about which we had spoken in the past. This
              prophecy was by no means a certainty, however, the connection between <gloss
                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Market might not be as firm as
              hitherto envisaged.</p>
            <p>As to the present international situation the Foreign Minister was pessimistic and
              rather alarmed. There was powder lying around in many spots and sparks flying which
              could start a blaze anywhere. He believed the Russian note to British and French<note
                n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">For text of the Soviet note, dated November 4, see <hi
                  rend="italic">Documents</hi> (R.I.I.A.) for 1956, pp. 280–281.</note> was a real
              threat and not a propaganda trick though he admitted it was possible that the Soviets
              were gambling on British and French decision to cease fire and wished to get credit
              for forcing this decision. Foreign Minister believes struggle for power is in process
              in Kremlin and if one man emerges victor he will be inclined to take dangerous steps
              in foreign policy, in part to offset obvious difficulties in satellites.</p>
            <p>Discussing the impact of the grave situation on Germany, the Foreign Minister
              emphasized that the population was very disturbed and to some degree alarmed. He
              agreed the fact that the Soviets were now threatening would assist the passage of
              legislation necessary for rearmament. But said no acceleration of tempo beyond that
              stated by <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> was possible without
              concurrence of opposition (<gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>). This was unlikely.
              Also any attempt to emphasize to the population dangers of present situation might
              well cause a panic. There were signs of such an incipient panic already. The
              government must be careful, otherwise a wave of buying might start, food stocks be
              affected and even a panicky evacuation of cities might begin. Therefore, though the
              new developments might to some degree accelerate buildup, there <pb n="172"
                xml:id="pg_172" facs="0200"/>could be no talk of an emergency requiring drastic
              reappraisal rearmament plans.</p>

            <p>1887. I accompanied Senator Green on his call on Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> today. Chancellor expressed himself very
              forcefully about present international situation, future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss>, and forthcoming Parliamentary conference on <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> which Senator is attending.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">The second
                conference of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> parliamentarians was held at
                Paris November 19–23.</note> Chancellor said recent events had caused such a split
              in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that he felt Parliamentary conference about
              to be held in Paris was without point and could do no good. Later in conversation he
              made it clear reason for this view is Chancellor’s belief that for a period of time
              situation in Near East is so critical and sensitive that US can not take lead which it
              should in reconstructing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, for to do so at this
              moment would be to give Russians an opportunity of claiming <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> was being strengthened as an instrument directed against the Soviet
              Union. However, Chancellor believes in a few months US must take leading role in
              reconstruction of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He emphasized again his
              belief <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must have strong political and unified
              basis for its military plans.</p>
            <p>In presenting this point of view Chancellor went into history of past few months at
              some length. He was highly critical of US in regard to our policy in Near East and,
              while not defending recent action of British and French in Egypt, stated in his
              opinion US Government had failed understand British position in Near East and French
              position in Algeria. He stated Algeria was not a colony but an integral part of France
              and he was very worried lest in defense of this part of France the French would go
              under. He went into some detail of his analysis of events leading up to <persName
                corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName>’s seizure of canal and was critical of US
              policy both in regard to Aswan Dam and subsequent proposals about Suez Canal. Since I
              was not in command of all pertinent facts I did not feel I would interrupt and
              challenge his very critical analysis of US policy in Near East.</p>
            <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>
            <p>Chancellor was also critical of our attitude in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
              >NATO</gloss>. He repeated what he has said on previous occasions, namely, that he has
              been told by his <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> Blankenhorn that US <gloss target="#t_Amb1"
                >Amb</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has more than once been
              without instructions when important issues were on agenda. Chancellor said if US
              representative in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council has no instructions
              there is no US leadership; without strong US leadership <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> can not be made strong as it should be.</p>
            <p>Chancellor further added that US had failed to appreciate extent to which Soviets had
              turned their strategy towards building up strength in Near East and Egypt in
              particular, referring to amount of arms and equipment which French and British
              reported they found in Egypt. He was further critical of both US and Great Britain for
              their readiness to believe during last year of so that there had been a real change in
              attitude of Soviet leaders. Events in Hungary,<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">Regarding
                the Hungarian uprising and the Soviet military intervention in November 1956, see
                  <ref target="frus1955-57v25">volume xxv</ref>.</note> Chancellor said, were
              evidence enough that US and British had been deceived.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, just as we were leaving, Chancellor spoke strongly about what he said
              was basic error of US foreign policy, namely, a shift last summer from US previous
              attempt to have controlled nuclear disarmament to policy based on assumption that US
              would be no. 1 in nuclear atomic military power, Soviet Union no. 2, and thereby the
              peace of world would be secure. This was an unrealistic position, Chancellor said, and
              the root of present difficulties.</p>
            <p>At this point I ventured to interrupt and challenged Chancellor’s statement that US
              had altered its policy in any such way as he had indicated. We had a rather vigorous
              exchange of views on this subject. I asked whether he wanted to have the US no. 2 in
              atomic superiority rather than no. 1. He said of course not but change of policy which
              had taken place meant we were no longer concerned with attempts to have atomic
              disarmament. I pointed out difficulties over the years in this field. He replied that
              the difficulties were not so great as to cause US to abandon our attempts. I denied
              that we had abandoned our attempts, to which Chancellor answered by saying our new
              policy of giving up conventional weapons made it impossible for US to consider atomic
              disarmament. Here again I challenged him as to his interpretation of our policy; he
              merely referred to an alleged statement of Standing Group and conversation came to an
              end as we were on point of leaving.</p>
            <p>Senator Green’s responses to Chancellor’s remarks in general were simply to agree
              that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should be strengthened. He made few
              comments in regard to substantive points Chancellor raised.</p>
            <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>
            <p>In connection with Chancellor’s critical attitude toward American foreign policy in
              Egyptian affair, I might point out that I have never had any instructions on basis of
              which I could attempt to present US side of case to Chancellor. It seems to me quite
              clear that British and particularly French sources had been quite active in presenting
              their side of argument. It further is clear Chancellor is confused about our military
              policy and the whole atomic military picture and its relation to US foreign policy. If
              I may venture the comment, it is my belief that it is Chancellor who is unrealistic
              and this is due to his fundamental lack of knowledge of realities of atomic age in
              which we live. I should welcome a directive from Washington which would enable me to
              present this whole picture in greater detail to Chancellor.</p>

            <p>Eyes only for Colonel <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> from General
                <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName>. Please inform the President that
              Ambassador Blankenhorn came to see me this morning. He spoke from handwritten notes
              and this was the substance of his conversation:</p>
            <p>“Since you are about to return to the United States, the Chancellor would like to
              have you deliver an oral message from him to the President. In the first place, he is
              most appreciative of the recent actions which President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                >Eisenhower</persName> has taken to restore unity to the West. It is as important to
              restore this unity among the Three as it is among the Fifteen.</p>
            <p>“As he sees the situation now, the big problem we have facing us is to improve our
              methods of political consultation. If we had achieved greater progress in that
              direction some time ago, it is doubtful if the Suez crisis would have happened. The
              Middle East problem is now one of our great difficulties, and we must solve it. The
              Chancellor is willing to help the President in every possible way.</p>
            <p>“With respect to the details for improving political consultation, the Chancellor
              hopes to have a specific proposal ready to make at the <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175"
                facs="0203"/>December Ministerial meeting in Paris. (Blankenhorn added here, “I
              think it is the Chancellor’s intention to have Ambassador Krekeler submit this
              proposal in advance to Washington if he can get it ready in time.”)</p>
            <p>“The United Nations Forces should not leave the Middle East until a final settlement
              has been made of the Israeli-Arab problem. Otherwise the Soviets will be able to make
              great progress in that area.</p>
            <p>“The Chancellor feels that an economic solution must be found for the Middle East—a
              sort of Colombo plan<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">The Colombo Plan for Cooperative
                Economic Development in Southeast Asia, inaugurated by the United Kingdom in 1950,
                included Ceylon, India, Pakistan, and the British territories of Malaya and
                Borneo.</note>—whereby the Middle East countries are made economic partners with the
              West.</p>
            <p>“With respect to the situation in middle Europe it is important that we remain
              patient and calm, and that we not push things too hard or too fast. This is creating a
              mild problem for the Chancellor since he must continuously hold ‘his own boys’ back.
              It is important that we not try to reach a solution by forceful means.</p>
            <p>“Military. The Chancellor wants the President to know of his regret that the Federal
              Republic has not been able to make better progress militarily. However, the political
              situation has been such that he has had to move more slowly than he had originally
              hoped. He now has a good Defense Minister in <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName>. However, he is not so well satisfied with his generals. They
              have not thus far shown enough imagination and push and pull. The military program is
              now being carefully re-examined and the Germans hope to have a reasonably effective
              fighting force by the end of 1957, but not before. The enlisted material is
              excellent.</p>
            <p>“The Chancellor believes that it would have a good effect on the West if the United
              States Forces in Europe could be reinforced. He realizes that this is a difficult
              matter for the United States, but he thinks it is desirable, at least for the next one
              or two years.</p>
            <p>“Contact with Washington. The Chancellor feels that it is highly important during
              this critical period that there be close contact between Bonn and Washington. He would
              like to go to Washington during the second half of January if the President considers
              it useful.</p>
            <p>“The Chancellor is grateful for what General <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1"
                >Gruenther</persName> said at his press conference on November 13th. It had a very
              good effect on German public opinion, which was getting jittery. He regretted that
              Minister <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> ‘popped off at the same time,
              but he does not think that it caused any harm. German public opinion is now
              considerably calmer over what it was ten days ago.</p>
            <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0204"/>
            <p>“In conclusion: The next few months are going to be difficult, but the situation can
              be handled if the contacts between the governments remain close. For that reason he
              would like to go to Washington in the second half of January if the President feels
              that such a visit would be helpful.”</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName>Chancellor</persName></hi>: I was very much
              interested in the views which you recently sent me through General <persName
                corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">See <ref
                  target="#d80"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> I agree with you that it
              is of the greatest importance and urgency that full unity be restored in the Western
              camp. It is most urgent that we bring to an end the threat of hostilities in the
              Middle East and move in the direction of an overall settlement in the area. The most
              immediate problems are to secure the withdrawal of armed forces in accordance with the
              United Nations resolution, keyed to the entry of the United Nations Emergency Force;
              implementation of the United Nations injunction against the introduction of new forces
              and military matériel in the area of conflict; and clearance of the Suez Canal. Beyond
              this, a basis must be found for solving the fundamental Arab-Israeli conflict and
              reaching agreement on a future regime for the Suez Canal. I welcome your thoughts on
              the subject and am certain you will agree with me on the necessity of working through
              the United Nations to find solutions to these problems.</p>
            <p>I agree also that there must be improved understanding regarding political
              consultation among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments. You have no
              doubt by this time seen the report of the Three Wise Men.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3"
                >The Three Wise Men submitted their report to the North Atlantic Council during its
                meeting in Paris, December 11–14, 1956; see <ref target="frus1955-57v04#pg_137">vol.
                  IV, pp. 137</ref> ff.</note> Although we have not yet had a chance to study this
              report in detail, it seems to us to provide a sound basis for dealing with this
              problem. However, methods of consultation are not enough. They must be used. While we
              must work toward harmonization of policies among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> countries, I am sure you will agree that it would be unrealistic <pb
                n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0205"/>to expect that we will be able always to
              achieve identity of viewpoint with regard to matters outside the <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area.</p>
            <p>Improvement of the economic conditions of the peoples of the Middle East is certainly
              an essential aspect of the problem of our relations with that area. This problem must
              be worked out with them on a cooperative basis. However, I doubt whether any general
              approach can be effectively undertaken until progress has been made toward solving the
              two basic problems of the Arab-Israeli conflict and of the Suez Canal.</p>
            <p>One of our greatest hopes in this direction is the clear and continuing evidence of
              basic differences in the thinking of some of the Heads of State in the Mideast. Some
              of these are deeply disturbed over recent developments and have a clear understanding
              of the dangers inherent in the policies pursued by their more reckless and
              irresponsible allies.</p>
            <p>I appreciate the difficulties which have confronted the Federal Republic in making
              progress in the buildup of its military forces to which you referred in your message.
              I hope that the Federal Government will soon be able to give <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> a firm statement of its plans. In our view, the need for the forces
              which Germany has undertaken to contribute to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              continues to be as great as ever. I am sure you will agree that the urgency for such a
              contribution has been made all the more apparent by recent events in Eastern
              Europe.</p>
            <p>While additional forces are needed to provide an effective <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> defense in Europe, it would be difficult to increase the American
              share. As you are aware, a good portion of our combat-ready ground forces is already
              stationed in Germany. Furthermore, an increase in our forces at this time would give
              rise to misunderstanding both here at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>I should very much welcome an opportunity to discuss these matters with you and would
              be glad if you could come to Washington some time in the new year. I will communicate
              with you again as to when we might arrange to see one another.</p>

            <p>Ambassador Krekeler came in to report to me on the results of his recent trip to

            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>Foreign Minister Von Brentano had advised the Ambassador that he would like to
                come to Washington for informal discussions during the second week of January. He
                felt that such discussions could be most profitable on both sides. I said that the
                Department would give the matter every consideration, but that I could not give an
                offhand answer.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>The Ambassador believed that it was most important that President Heuss should
                make a formal visit to the United States during the early spring. He felt that this
                was especially important in view of the elections which would be coming up later in
                the year and the necessity of gaining support against neutralist elements which were
                always a threat in the German situation. The Ambassador thought that a date soon
                after Easter—about April 20—would be most convenient for his President. I promised
                that we would look into the matter.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>The Ambassador said that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName> was preparing a memorandum for President <persName
                  corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, stating the views of the German
                Government on their policies in central Europe and the Middle East.<note n="2"
                  xml:id="d82fn2">No copy of this memorandum has been found in Department of State
                  files. It was presumably a more formalized version of the Chancellor’s message to
                    <persName>Eisenhower</persName>; see <ref target="#d80">Document
                  80</ref>.</note> He believed that this memorandum would be most useful in (a)
                pulling together the views of the German Government and (b) clarifying a number of
                points which had so far perhaps been misunderstood on both sides.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>As a result of the actions of the U.K. and France in the Middle East, the
                Ambassador said that reaction in Germany had been so violently against those two
                countries that it was at present impossible to proceed with plans for European
                integration, common market, <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, etc. He
                believed that, given a little time, this situation might be rectified but any moves
                in this direction at present could be counter-productive.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>The Ambassador said that he would like to make a number of observations in
                connection with our plans for the coming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                meeting, and I suggested that he get together with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                  >MacArthur</persName>. He agreed to do this early next week.</item>

              <label>6.</label>
              <item>With regard to the Hungarian situation, the Ambassador said that he had talked
                with a number or his friends while in Germany who had accompanied a German Red Cross
                unit into Budapest during the height of the fighting. The Ambassador reported that
                these people were qualified military observers and it was their unanimous opinion
                that the operation of the Russian military units was motivated by military
                considerations and that they did not seem to be dictated by political
                considerations.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>With regard to Egypt, the Ambassador told me that the Chancellor had told him
                that there should be plans developed for economic aid to the Egyptian people. The
                Ambassador replied to the Chancellor that any such suggestions by the German
                Government would have to be accompanied by a willingness on their part to
                participate in the program. He gathered that the Chancellor would be willing to make
                such a recommendation. I pointed out to him the importance of coordinating our plans
                for such aid as it might well be necessary at some period to exert concerted
                pressure on the Egyptian Government to adopt a reasonable course and that we should
                not be working at cross-purposes.</item>

              <item>The German Minister of Defense, according to the Ambassador, wished to
                concentrate upon the immediate organization of five divisions to be combat-ready by
                the end of 1957. He anticipated that they would be available on an organized but
                only partially trained basis by the middle of the year. This decision in no way
                changed their plans for an ultimate force of twelve divisions. He anticipated that
                these divisions would have less men but more fire power than had originally been
                planned.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>The Ambassador closed the visit with assurance that the Chancellor wished, above
                all, to have close and harmonious relations with the United States and that his
                actions would be governed to an overriding extent by such a policy. I thanked the
                Ambassador and assured him of our great desire to cooperate. I pointed out, however,
                that our problems undoubtedly would be multiplied by remarks that the Chancellor had
                made to other people, such as Senator Green, in which he appeared to violently
                disagree with our policies and had criticized them in no uncertain terms. The
                Ambassador appeared much embarrassed and assured me that he would do everything to
                help eliminate the effects of such criticism. I advised him that we would show him
                the report of the conversation with Senator Green at an early opportunity.</item>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am especially grateful that you,
              although preoccupied right now with so many acute problems, found the time to give
              such extensive consideration to my worries reported to you by General <persName

            <p>The particularly close interdependence of all European affairs should serve as an
              explanation for my deep concern, though at a first glance the Federal Republic is not
              immediately affected by all pending questions. Permit me, my dear Mr. President, to
              express to you two additional ideas:</p>
            <p>After your re-election by such an overwhelming majority, your leadership is more than
              ever the strong and only hope for the free nations that they will survive in this
              dangerous period of mankind. Our heartfelt prayers are with you.</p>
            <p>Let me make, my dear Mr. President, one other point: The developments of the last
              months, the brutal actions of the Soviet Union everywhere, with arms and other means
              confirm my opinion that Europe remains the main target of Soviet policy and
              aggression. P[ar] e[xample], there are more than 7000 tanks in the Soviet occupied
              zone pointing towards Germany and Western Europe. If the Soviet Union holds Europe,
              she will control Asia as well. If her position in Europe will be reduced to natural
              proportions by restricting her power, she can no longer entertain any hope to gain
              Asia, too. Therefore, the Soviet Union still strives for the control of Europe, in
              spite of all deviating maneuvers and all present assurances which she will break at a
              time she considers opportune. The domination of Europe would give to the Soviet Union
              the key to the control of the world she strives for.</p>
            <p>I hope you will understand, my dear Mr. President, why I have reiterated these ideas
              and convictions. I do so because I believe that the freedom of the world was never—not
              even in Hitler’s time—so much endangered as in these years.</p>
            <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                from the United States, the Federal Republic has continued to progress toward the
                major objectives of close association with the West and collective defense. However,
                internal support for the Government appears to have diminished, primarily because of
                dissatisfaction with the general course of developments in the fields of rearmament
                and reunification. Influenced by the approach of the next Federal elections,
                tentatively scheduled for September 1957, the Government has made decisions which
                may adversely affect the speed and effectiveness of the German military build-up.

                  <item><p><hi rend="italic">German Contribution to Western Defense.</hi> The German
                      build-up continues to develop at a deliberate pace, with numerous storm
                      signals pointing to mounting troubles ahead. The recruitment of volunteers has
                      been proceeding on schedule, although lack of accommodations will result in
                      failure to reach the force level of 96,000 originally planned by the end of
                      this year. With regard to equipment, deliveries of American grant-aid material
                      amply cover current requirements and permit the recruiting program to proceed
                      without delay. The Federal Government concluded procedural arrangements with
                      the United States and with European countries which will allow for the
                      purchase of additional military equipment, materials and services, as may be
                      required, and has discussed placing orders in the United States for military
                      equipment in the neighborhood of $1.3 billion. It has also agreed to carry its
                      share of the cost of the current <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                      infrastructure program, which includes important installations in Germany.
                      After a long and difficult negotiation the Germans agreed to contribute to the
                      support of Allied forces in amounts totalling $347 million (U.S. share—$154
                      million) for the year ending May 5, 1957, as compared with $760 million (U.S.
                      share—$350 million) for the year ending May 5, 1956. During the period, U.S.
                      established that deliveries of military end-items for the German build-up
                      beyond the Nash Commitment would be made on a reimbursable aid basis.</p>
                    <p>The basic legislation of the Federal Government in the field of defense was
                      substantially completed with the enactment in July of a conscription law.
                      While an eighteen-month period of service had been urged upon the German

                      adequate training for the new German forces, the Federal Government
                      nevertheless decided to seek legislation for a twelvemonth period of service.
                      The North Atlantic Council promptly expressed grave concern at this
                      development.</p></item>

              <item><p><hi rend="italic">Defense Contribution.</hi> During the past six months the
                  Federal Government, in endeavoring to implement the German defense contribution,
                  has been confronted with an increasingly adverse public reaction and the impact of
                  a national election campaign already under way. Doubts already existing within
                  Germany as to whether the German military contribution was being properly
                  organized or adapted to the requirements of the actual situation were strengthened
                  by press reports during the summer of alleged American plans to reduce the size of
                  American armed forces in conjunction with greater emphasis on atomic weapons. The
                  probability of a basic re-examination by the Germans of the character of the
                  agreed German defense contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was
                  indicated by the replacement of Defense Minister Blank by former Atomic Minister
                  Franz Josef Strauss, a persistent critic of German rearmament plans and an
                  advocate of a relatively small but highly trained armed force equipped with atomic
                  weapons. In consequence it now appears doubtful whether the force goal of 12
                  divisions previously contemplated under German commitments to <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will be fully met. It is in any case unlikely
                  that the original build-up schedule will be adhered to. There is even some doubt
                  as to whether measures for conscription, without which it will be impossible to
                  create a 12-division army, will be implemented before the 1957 German elections.
                  The renewed threat of Soviet aggression as evidenced by developments in Hungary
                  and Poland may help, however, to overcome public resistance to the measures
                  necessary to accomplish the German build-up.</p>
                <p>The fact that the Federal Government for domestic political reasons did not adopt
                  the recommendations of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with regard to the
                  period of service under the conscription law represents a setback in the
                  development of German relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                  points to other possible problems in the future in this area. It is clear that the
                  Government itself has not yet solved the problem of developing a convincing method
                  of presenting to the German public the benefits and responsibilities of <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership and the military value to Germany of
                  the German defense contribution. Faced with internal opposition to its military
                  build-up plans, the Germans are likely to <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0212"
                  />tend to shift the blame for delays in the build-up to developments outside

              <item><hi rend="italic">German Reunification.</hi> The campaign for 1957 elections
                will highlight increasingly the issue of German reunification, and there will be
                continuing pressure in the Federal Republic for further activity in this field.

                  serious pressures in Germany to join with other West European countries in urging
                  the elimination of the China control differential. The United States is urging the
                  German Government to resist these pressures but in the interest of ensuring full
                  German support is at the same time re-examining its own position. A further
                  problem is posed by continuing political pressure from the opposition parties and

              convey to you some thoughts on the occasion of your participation in the <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council meeting.</p>
            <p>As you may imagine, I am watching the situation and developments in the Eastern Bloc
              with the greatest attention since these developments are perhaps of decisive
              importance for the fate of Europe. My observations and considerations lead me to the
              following conclusions: <list>
                <label>1.</label>
                <item>Soviet Russia’s ruling class continues to be firmly convinced that Communism
                  under Soviet leadership will gain control over the world. This may sound
                  improbable to people of our mentality, but nevertheless it is so. It can be
                  accounted for only if the mentality of the atheistic dictatorship and the faith of
                  the Russians in their mission are taken into consideration. In the past—and this
                  includes me personally—we have had similar experiences in Germany when the
                  National Socialist dictatorship and the doctrine that National Socialism would
                  dominate the world completely, radically changed the thinking of people. I believe
                  that the politicians of all free nations should never lose sight of the fact that
                  the Russians are completely governed by the faith that Communism will rule the
                  world.</item>
                <label>2.</label>
                <item>Soviet Russia—even if she continues her tactics of concentrating her action
                  sometimes on one and sometimes on another spot of the globe—will not reach her aim
                  unless she succeeds in dominating Western Europe, and the Russians are well aware
                  of this. It is a fact that they will never be able to gain world domination with
                  the aid of Asiatic peoples alone. Europe and not Asia holds the key to Russian
                  world domination.</item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>To be sure, a world power like the United States will have to pay attention
                  also to the problems arising outside Europe. It is my firm conviction, however,
                  that the fate of humanity and thus of the United States, too, will depend on what
                  becomes of Europe.</item>
                <label>4.</label>
                <item>The Almighty has entrusted the United States with world leadership, thus
                  imposing an obligation concomitant with the power that has accrued to the United
                  States.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>I would ask you, therefore, my dear Mr. Secretary, to take into consideration the
              above ideas when pursuing your policy, notwithstanding the numerous mistakes and
              omissions of which the European side might rightly be accused.</p>
            <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>
            <p>Recent developments in Soviet Russia and in the nations of the Eastern Bloc prove

              hope that they will yet succeed in overcoming their difficulties.</p>

            <p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 18. Brentano, accompanied by Hallstein, met
              with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> for half hour this
              morning. Views on variety of subjects were exchanged in cordial atmosphere, and there
              appeared to be general agreement in points of view.</p>
            <p>Brentano mentioned his pleasure that report of Committee of Three had just been
              adopted, and Secretary agreed this should be major step forward for <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Secretary remarked that unrest in satellites seemed to him to increase risk of war by
              miscalculation on part of Soviets, who might be tempted to take actions to offset
              Soviet difficulties. Brentano, agreeing, said that he was fearful that if situation in
              Poland deteriorated radically East Germany might blow up in revolution. Secretary said
              he realized it would be difficult for people of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1"
                >FedRep</gloss> to refrain from reacting under such circumstances and this could
              start major war. Brentano agreed and said problem would become particularly acute for
                <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> if border between East and West Germany
              were blocked (meaning presumably that this would prevent outflow of refugees).
              Secretary said that this would create dangerous situation, and went on to speak
              briefly of need for German as well as United States forces in Germany in order that
              there should be “fair sharing” of defense burden. He expressed United States
              gratification that there were now concrete plans for raising of German forces. He then
              said that United Kingdom is in serious financial and economic trouble and that it
              seemed to United States that Germany should try find ways to help United Kingdom.
              Secretary mentioned United States, despite increasing defense burdens, is taking
              substantial steps to ease Britain’s serious financial problem. He stated that Germany,
              “out of her present economic strength,” should be willing also to assist. Brentano
              stated, “we are ready to do so”.</p>
            <p>Secretary mentioned his understanding that United Kingdom may cut down on size of its
              divisions and stated that United States also plans to reduce size of its divisions in
              Europe and elsewhere in light of weapons development and evolving military concepts.
              This would give United States divisions greater mobility and fire power. Brentano said
              it was his understanding that German divisions would conform in size roughly to new
              divisional strength of United States divisions.</p>
            <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"/>
            <p>With respect to political climate for rearmament in Germany, Brentano Stated
              situation was greatly improved. He mentioned fact that draft law had been approved by
              two-[thirds?] majority in Bundestag and that in preliminary lists of draftees, less
              than one percent have asked for exemptions on pacifist grounds. This he described as
              good symptom and mentioned many had worked actively to create “conscientious
              objectors” and had predicted that 30 percent of draftees would apply for exemptions.
              Secretary again expressed view that once good German army begins to take shape, German
              people will take pride in it and will support necessary defense measures. Brentano
              agreed and thought this would have good effect on 1957 elections.</p>
            <p>Brentano then raised question of how to deal with <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> note on disarmament,<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">For text of

                  >Documents</hi> (R.I.I.A.) for 1956, p. 605.</note> stating <gloss
                target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> definitely thought West should be very wary in
              responding to proposals, which have number of dangerous features. Secretary replied
              that United States has draft reply which will be discussed in <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                >NAC</gloss> shortly. He described reply as brief one which “dismissed” Soviet
              proposals. He said one of basic defeats of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> proposals is that they are based on assumption of a permanent
              division of Germany, since dividing line runs through Germany. He said we also view
              the coverage of aerial inspection proposed by Soviets as not being responsive to
              President’s proposal<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">For text of President <persName
                  corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s “Open Skies” proposal, see <ref

                  target="frus1955-57v05#pg_456">456</ref>.</note> since it excludes Soviet Union
              and gives obvious military advantages to USSR. He said he would expect our views to be
              discussed in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> possibly next week. Brentano fully
              agreed with this line of thinking, emphasizing fact Soviet Union itself was not
              included in zone of inspection and that Soviet proposal, if accepted, would be
              “beginning of idea of withdrawal of US and UK forces from Europe.”</p>
            <p>Brentano then handed Secretary a memorandum,<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4">Not found in
                Department of State files.</note> which he described as basic ideas of <gloss
                target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> concerning Middle East (memorandum not yet
              translated but will be sent immediately when available in English). Secretary stated
              while United States not yet decided on details, we are definitely prepared to make our
              presence felt more actively in Middle East than heretofore. When Brentano mentioned
              that this was [garble—one of] points of memorandum, Secretary laughingly remarked that
              perhaps he should have points of memorandum before telling Brentano of our decision.
              He then briefly sketched ill effects which had come from United Kingdom and French
              action in Suez—violence done to our alliance, to UN, to political position of UK and
              France in the Middle East, and to their influence <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190"
                facs="0218"/>in Arab world, extremely adverse economic effects on all Western
              European countries and particularly UK and France, and cloak that this action gave to
              Soviet repression in Hungary. He said he had last summer pointed out all this to
              British and French; despite this fact, he now noticed tendency to blame US for
              consequences of their folly. Pointing out that United States will do all it can to
              help its allies recover from this folly, we cannot be expected completely to right
              situation for them.</p>
            <p>Brentano said that for reasons given by Secretary and particularly because UK-French
              action gave cover to Soviet repression in Eastern Europe, majority of German public
              opinion opposed UK-French action. However, he explained that Germany had to strive to
              prevent a breakdown of European unity and for that reason Chancellor and he had gone
              to Paris in November to talk to French. One of results of this trip, he thought, was
              ratification of Saar treaty by French Assembly. He also mentioned that he was
              returning to Bonn tomorrow to be present for third reading before Bundestag of Saar
              treaty.</p>

            <p>During a call on the Secretary, Ambassador Krekeler referred to a suggestion which
              had been made for establishing a four-power working group on European security and
              disarmament. He said that his Government was very much interested in this
              suggestion.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he had received such a suggestion from M. Pineau on the
              occasion of his visit to Washington,<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">Regarding French
                Foreign Minister Pineau’s visit to the United States, January 9–11, see <ref

                n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>it had been raised even earlier. He said that
              he was sympathetic to the suggestion but thought it would be necessary to be careful
              regarding the terms of reference of the working group. Unless the terms of reference
              were carefully defined, the establishment of the working group might cause trouble. He
              said that the Italian Ambassador had called on him and was extremely disturbed by the
                suggestion.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">A memorandum of this conversation is <hi
                  rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 762.00/1–2257.</note> The Ambassador had
              asked why the task had not been entrusted to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
              wanted to know whether the four powers intended to set up an executive council to the
              exclusion of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he had told the Ambassador that there was no reason for
              concern and that policy decisions affecting or of interest to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> would be taken up in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as
              previously. The suggestion of a working group was not designed to exclude other <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. The problem involved was that of the
              reunification of Germany. This was a matter of four-power responsibility. It directly
              affected the Germans and was of concern to the US, UK, and France, which have a
              special position with regard to Germany which is recognized by the London and Paris
              agreements. The Secretary said that the Italian Ambassador appeared to accept this
              position.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he thought that the terms of reference for the working group
              should be directed toward the question of reunification. If they were broadened to
              include European security, a number of countries would be interested. The Secretary
              said that he realized the problems were related. Achieving reunification would
              probably depend on reaching an agreement on European security. The matter had been
              dealt with in that connection at the Geneva Conference where we had put forward
              proposals which were related to German reunification.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he doubted that we would make much progress on the question of
              German reunification until the situation in the satellite area reached a more clearly
              defined status. He thought that the USSR would not be happy to see a projection of the
              Federal Republic into Eastern Europe. As the satellites become more independent, the
              chances of reunification will grow.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that it would be necessary to determine where the working group
              should meet and what the level of representation should be. The Ambassador asked
              whether there was any suggestion as to the place of meeting. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said that it had been suggested that the
              meeting be held in Washington. The Secretary said he would not exclude Paris as a
              possibility. However, this might involve a complication with regard to relations with
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He thought the meeting should be held either
              in Washington or <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0220"/>Paris, rather than New York,
              London or Bonn. Ambassador Krekeler said he had reported the suggestion that it would
              be in Washington or Paris and that there had been no objection on the part of his
              Government.</p>

              <item><p>During 1956 there was some fluctuation in closeness and cordiality of overall
                  US-German relations. Fluctuation, however, took place on almost abnormally high
                  plane of friendship and was due more to misunderstanding than difference of
                  outlook. Low point was reached during summer as result of “<persName
                    corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> Plan”.</p>
                <p>Presence American troops is acknowledged by almost all as best concrete assurance
                  that US would come to Germany’s defense if she were attacked. Govt is inclined to
                  get jittery at hint of any withdrawal of US forces, and Chancellor is particularly
                  sensitive this subject. He is almost pathologically fearful US might either reach
                  agreement with Soviets on disarmament, before reunification problem solved, or
                  become so reliant on “strategic” atomic weapons as to withdraw into some form of
                  isolation.</p>
                <p>Important factor contributing to Chancellor’s dismay and anger over so-called
                    “<persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> Plan” was feeling it made him
                  look silly politically after his long fight for large German army and because
                  having just returned from Washington and advertised complete accord with US Govt.

                <p>Other members of govt and <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> have been generally
                  convinced that our basic policy has not changed and have been embarrassed by
                    <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s strong reaction. Even so,
                  recent statements by prominent individuals such as Senators Knowland, <persName
                    corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Sparkman and Flanders, and new concepts

                    >Stassen</persName>, upset them, particularly because ammunition thus provided
                  Socialist opposition.</p>
                <p>Year’s end saw excellent German-American relations because of reassuring
                  statements by Secretary on European policy, admiration for American position
                  during Suez crisis, nature of President’s reply to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                    >Bulganin</persName> and because events in Hungary brought home with increased
                  force extent of German dependency on US.</p>
                <p>There has as yet been little reaction to announcement of proposed cuts in size of
                  US divisions, possibly because not yet known whether resulting savings in manpower
                  would automatically be followed by proportionate reduction in number of US
                  soldiers in Germany. We believe even if this means eventual withdrawal of 10 thus
                  and US soldiers from Germany, it could probably be handled so that repercussions
                  in German public opinion and among most Govt leaders would not be great. We cannot
                  confidently make such prediction with respect to Chancellor, however, and
                  concurrent British cuts may well make situation more difficult.</p>
                <p>Sporadic but extremely unpleasant incidents involving US soldiers seem to have
                  made no permanent impression, and it is not expected that problems arising from

                    something, they continue to poke at problem by talking about making it capital,
                    about voting rights for Berlin deputies in Bundestag, etc. They can be expected

            <p>One of great anomalies of German military buildup is that it begins in midst of
              protracted international discussion of disarmament. This fact plays into hands of
              opponents of rearmament in Germany and creates difficult psychological atmosphere in
              which Govt must take such politically unpopular steps as conscription. Moreover, Govt
              finds itself in something of self-contradictory position on disarmament; in principle,
              it supports international agreement to reduce forces provided adequate safeguards are
              assured (fully endorsing US position in this regard), while it secretly would prefer
              to see no major agreement reached until German buildup attains dimensions permitting
                <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to negotiate on more equal basis vis-à-vis
              both East and West. In other words although they fear war, they also fear sharp <pb
                n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>reduction in international tensions would take
              heat off Western attempts to obtain acceptable reunification.</p>
            <p>Further complications in effort to rearm arise from twin sets of facts: on one hand,
              conscription and “militarism” are unpleasant concepts (as is gradually dawning
              realization of cost of modern armies). Germans are, therefore, tempted obtain more
              power with fewer men (and less money) by use of nuclear weapons. On other hand, they
              are also aware—particularly true of Chancellor—all-out nuclear war would be
              catastrophic. They are, therefore, only beginning to struggle with following
              questions: What is relationship in nuclear age of military power to national strategy,
              how far can one rely on a deterrent concept which is based on weapons whose use might
              mean destruction of civilization, and how can a Govt of democratic processes long
              maintain large (and expensive) military establishment without creating by-products
              dangerous to democratic structure of state itself?</p>
            <p>To date Govt seems to have selected, consciously or otherwise, following solution to
              dilemma: continue to worry about larger implications for Germany and Western
              civilization involved in large nuclear stockpiles on both sides of curtain, while
              concurrently requesting assignment of “tactical” nuclear weapons for their own forces
              and stoutly maintaining that there exists a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              requirement for large conventional forces. This is apparently based on following
              beliefs: (a) that their forces must have most modern weapons if they are to be
              effective, (b) that use of such weapons makes possible forces less costly in both
              money and men, and (c) that there could be a “limited” use of nuclear weapons in a
              European conflict or that there could be hostilities in Europe of some size in which
              only “conventional” weapons were employed.</p>
            <p>Despite above, no substantial body of German opinion concludes <gloss
                target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> should stand aside unarmed and leave US and USSR
              to face each other alone.</p>

                  to put country in much healthier position withstand world economic crisis than

              <item>Domestic political scene has become much more fluid. Recent local elections
                appeared to show <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> passed <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                  >CDU</gloss>—temporarily at least—in popular support. Events in Hungary deeply
                affected German thought and may have served to alter the balance in favor of <gloss
                  target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>. Moreover, events of coming eight months can change
                picture drastically; but if no decisive events take place in that interval,
                Socialists appear have almost even chance entering government. It therefore of
                interest to examine to extent feasible today what changes might be expected of
                German policy if <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> no longer in control.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Present Socialist leadership is moderate and anti-Communist. Embassy concludes that
              if <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> were to assume responsibility for conduct of
              govt, German foreign policy would not—in spite of nerve-wracking initial period of
              “sloshing around”—change to extent dangerous to West. Nevertheless, new tone and
              emphasis would undoubtedly be given reunification problem. <gloss target="#t_SPD1"
                >SPD</gloss> Govt would display greater activity and initiative. Actually, <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> unlikely accept solution much different from one which
                <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> might have been forced to accept had Soviets
              offered unity for non-participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> predicates its agreement to any solution on Western
              approval, including “security guarantee”, exact nature of which not yet defined.
              Despite continued formal opposition to membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss>, Socialists have publicly declared they will not tear up treaties.</p>
            <p><gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>’s position against <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> membership for reunited Germany means that any further conference with
              Soviets on topic would begin with Western negotiating position weakened.</p>
            <p><gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> remains largely under <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName>’s personal control, although party demonstrated greater
              independence of Chancellor in 1956 than heretofore. Internal stresses continue strong;
              if <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> should die, intra-party dissension
              would come even more to fore, but probably <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> would
              not split. Succession question would be one of most difficult to solve since there is
              still no clear “heir apparent”. Half dozen men are in running, with Foreign Minister
              Brentano appearing hold lead. If reelected Chancellor, <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> may agree step down voluntarily after additional year’s
              service, thus permitting more orderly transition.</p>
            <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"/>
            <p>It must also be remembered that there are several small parties which may be in
              position to dictate composition of another coalition.</p>
            <p>A phenomenon of domestic scene is that both major Govt and opposition parties attach
              so much importance to American goodwill in election year that both <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and Ollenhauer planning trips to US in coming
              months.</p>
            <p><gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> in general, and <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> in particular, will undoubtedly expect overt American
              endorsement at time of elections as in 1953.</p>
            <p>Finally, democracy has become going concern in West Germany. Although national traits
              have not basically changed in ten years and there is much history to overcome, present
              parliamentary system seems to have become accepted as natural way of life, has won
              support of broad mass of population, and has no substantial body of opponents
              internally. Further, establishment of republic has been attended by tremendous rise in
              standard of living and has attained international respect and support of West. Barring
              severe depression and/or major international political reverses, foregoing trends
              appear have good prospect of continuing.</p>

            <p>On reunification issue and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s
              reference to two German Governments, Chancellor formulated what seemed to me a by-pass
              of essential issue; namely, status of Pankow. He said something to effect that in
              Moscow it had been agreed that reunification was responsibility of four powers and he
              expected Soviets to live up to this promise of their responsibility. Then note ended
              with discussion of Germans still held in Russia.</p>
            <p>In connection with his dealing with reunification, he stated that in note which would
              be sent later, position of his government as being only legitimate and authorized
              spokesman for all Germany would be emphasized. I suggested to him this was matter of
              some importance as there was misunderstanding in some circles in United States on this
              point. Chancellor expressed opinion that there was no danger that any considerable
              portion of German opinion would demand negotiations with Pankow at any level. He
              agreed Socialist opposition was as clear on this point as he was.</p>
            <p>On looking to future, Chancellor was optimistic about election prospects for his
              party. His worry for long term was that if Socialists came into government, right
              radical tendencies still existing in Lower Saxony would once again become active.</p>

                Party</item>

                Secretary</item>
            </list>
            <p>During his call on the President, Mr. <persName>Ollenhauer</persName> raised the
              question of German reunification and European security. He said that it is apparent
              that there can be no reunification of Germany without the agreement of the Soviet
              Union and the Soviet Union is unwilling to contemplate a reunited Germany in the North
              Atlantic Treaty Organization. He, as the leader of the Social Democratic Party in
              Germany, felt that it is entirely possible that present Soviet opposition to
              reunification can be overcome by an agreement “acceptable to both sides”. He felt that
              it is most important to strive to reach such an agreement in order that Germany may
              develop normally. The President observed that the difficulty with this thesis is the
              fact that, while the Western Powers would observe the terms of any such agreement,
              Soviet behavior has taught US that the Soviet Union would violate such an agreement
              whenever it might feel that it was to its advantage to do so. For this reason, the
              President said, we feel strongly that the Western Powers can only talk to the Soviet
              from a position of strength. For this reason also, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> is an indispensable defense structure which enables US to deal
              confidently with Russia.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Ollenhauer</persName> said that the Social Democratic Party in Germany
              does not favor unilateral talks between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Union on
              the subject of reunification. His party recognizes that Germany’s very close
              connections with the West demand that any negotiation in this field be conducted with
              the Western Powers. He did not want the President to be in any doubt about this. The
              President said that Germany is one of the strongest of the European countries and
              that, since this is so, it is inconceivable that Germany can be a “neutral” country.
              While it would be most undesirable for Germany to revert to the militaristic policies
              of former years, it is important that it not remain unarmed and that it form a part of
              a peaceable but strong European defense structure. The President said further that the
              preservation of peace is the basis for our deep interest in the matter of European
              integration. The uniting of European countries can, he believed, assure the peace of
              the world. Mr. <persName>Ollenhauer</persName> agreed that it is impossible to
              contemplate a neutral Germany.</p>
            <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"/>
            <p>He was in complete agreement with the President on the great importance of European
              unity and he felt that present efforts at integration should be carried further and
              include all European countries and not only six of them. The President felt that once
              the six have joined together in a European community other countries would be
              attracted to that nucleus. It is possible that such a community would exercise a
              peaceful influence on the satellite countries of Eastern Europe. He felt that the
              development of a real European community would be the greatest imaginable step
              forward.</p>

            <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by saying we were very happy to have Mr.
                <persName>Von Brentano</persName> here. He was sorry that his visit could not
              coincide with that of President Heuss as originally scheduled and regretted that the
              latter’s indisposition had prevented him from coming at this time. The Secretary
              referred briefly to his plans for leaving Washington on March 6 for the SEATO
              Conference in Australia,<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">For documentation on the third

            <p>Turning to the first item on the agenda,<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">A copy of the
                agenda is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 62 D 181, CF 834.</note> the
              Middle East, the Secretary said he would be interested in hearing the German views on
              this subject but he understood the Germans were primarily interested in hearing his
              own appraisal. Brentano indicated assent.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he had had some discussion of the Middle East with Mr.
                <persName>Von Brentano</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              Meeting last December and that he would proceed from that point. The United States had
              taken the position from the outset in the Middle East dispute that in accordance with
              the provision of the United Nations Charter disputes must be settled by peaceful means
              and force should not be used against the territorial integrity of another state. The
              Secretary said that most countries’ attitudes and positions in their international
              relations reflect their natural affinities rather than principles. The United States,
              however, felt that its position in the world today was such that it must base its
              policy on certain fundamental principles rather than let our position be governed by
              what countries we liked or by historic friendships. This was not an easy position to
              take and it was possibly the first time in history such a position had in fact been
              taken.</p>
            <p>The United States had therefore supported the UN resolutions calling for withdrawal
              of the attacking forces.<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">For documentation on the Suez
                Canal crisis, including these resolutions, see <ref target="frus1955-57v26">volume
                  XVI</ref>.</note> The British and French had complied but Israel had not yet done
              so, and there was feeling that pressure would have to be exerted on the Israelis. We
              had thought it might be easier for the Israelis to withdraw if the United States made
              a statement as to the position it would take on some of the fundamental issues, not in
              the nature of any promise or inducement, or by way of giving Israel anything to which
              it was not entitled, in the event of Israeli withdrawal. We therefore had given a
              memorandum to the Israeli Government on February 11<note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">For
                text, see <ref target="frus1955-57v17#pg_132">vol. XVII, pp. 132</ref>–<ref
                  target="frus1955-57v27#pg_134">134</ref>.</note> setting <pb n="204"
                xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>forth our views on the international status of the Gulf
              of Aqaba and the Straits of Tiran. There was nothing new in our position and the
              Egyptian Government had itself taken the same position some six years ago. With regard
              to the Gaza Strip, it was under Egyptian administration pursuant to the armistice
              agreement but was not a part of Egypt. The Secretary pointed out that the area had no
              natural resources, not even water. The population consisted predominantly of the
              refugees who were being supported by the United Nations, with most of the money being
              furnished by the U.S. He drew the conclusion that there was a considerable reason, in
              view of these facts, for the United Nations to exercise responsibility in the Gaza
              area. The Secretary said he felt that our statement of these views to the Israeli
              Government had partly been responsible for the announcement last Friday of the Israeli
              decision to withdraw its troops.</p>
            <p>At the moment Premier Ben Gurion had run into political difficulties at home and the
              present situation was obscure. The Israeli Government had requested further assurances
              from us, but we had replied we could give no assurances beyond what had already been
              announced publicly. He hoped that the Israeli Government would take a favorable
              decision today.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that if the Israelis did withdraw, the focus of attention would
              shift to the Arab countries, particularly Egypt, and the Suez Canal. Egypt had not
              allowed the clearing of the Canal to be completed. In his own mind, there was no doubt
              that they were dragging their feet and using the Canal as a means for trying to bring
              about the withdrawal of Israeli forces. He spoke at some length on the adverse
              consequences, particularly to the countries of the Middle East and South Asia, if the
              Canal were not opened. He said that the Texas Railway Commission had authorized an
              increase in Texas production of 200,000 barrels a day and that, with the approach of
              summer, the immediate situation did not involve an intolerable burden on Europe,
              although the purchase of oil in the United States and Venezuela involved higher costs
              and a foreign exchange burden.</p>
            <p>We therefore believed we should do all we could to get the Israelis to withdraw.
              Otherwise fighting might break out again and Soviet penetration of the Middle East
              would be facilitated. The Secretary felt our two countries were in the best position
              to influence Israel. He had had a talk with Ambassador Krekeler the other day and was
              pleased to learn that the German Government had made representations to the Government
              of Israel to induce withdrawal.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then discussed briefly the matter of Canal tolls. A proposal had been
              put forward to the UN Secretary General that these tolls should be paid to some
              international institution such as the International Bank, with Egypt to get half the
              total amount and the other half to be impounded pending a final settlement. Fifty
              percent <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>of the Canal tolls could considerably
              more than meet Egypt’s out-of-pocket expenses for maintaining and operating the
              Canal.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that Egypt had taken an equivocal position regarding the Six
              Principles agreed on last October and now claimed these were no longer applicable. He
              regarded this position as untenable, since the Six Principles were an expression of
              the application of the Constantinople Convention of 1888 and therefore had permanent
              and universal significance for all countries. Whatever the rights and the wrongs of
              the British-French action, there was no reason why other countries should be penalized
              for it. He pointed out that the Six Principles were all right as far as they go but
              they call for further implementation. Steps toward that end had been taken as
              reflected by the <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> report on his
              talks with the British, French and Egyptians. Whether it would be possible to pick the
              matter up at that stage, he did not know. The time might not be ripe to attempt to
              bring the three governments together in the same room and <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                >Hammarskjöld</persName> might have to negotiate with them separately. The Secretary
              said that Egypt should be disposed to reach a settlement since it was in a bad
              economic position, but hints have come out that they don’t want to.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that there was a real danger that the Canal would be opened
              without a settlement. This would mean that there would be a de facto situation in
              which Egypt would get whatever it wanted. He expressed concern that everyone would be
              so eager to use the Canal that we might lose the possibility of safeguarding the
              longer-run interests of the user nations. He particularly was concerned that there be
              assurances against the use of the Canal as an instrument of national policy. The
              Secretary said there was no doubt in his mind that the Egyptians were using the Canal
              in this manner. He said we could not be acquiescent in this situation. Some machinery
              was necessary to prevent Egypt from blackmailing us in the future. He said that
                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> was hopeful that after the
              withdrawal of the Israeli forces, the Egyptians would be reasonable and flexible. He
              said this was the position which <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> was
              taking in New York but he was not sure that what <persName corresp="#p_FM1"
                >Fawzi</persName> said was all backed up by <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1"
                >Nasser</persName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Von Brentano</persName> thanked the Secretary for his appraisal. He
              said that as far as basic principles were concerned there seemed to be complete
              agreement between the two Governments regarding the assessment of the situation and of
              the measures to be taken. While Germany had no direct interest in the Middle East
              dispute, it did have three rather important indirect interests.</p>
            <p>In the first place Germany had been an important user of the Canal and had a vital
              interest in the reopening of the waterway. He <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0234"
              />had made a statement on this subject at the London Conference, to which he felt it
              was unnecessary to add.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there was a problem with regard to the Federal Republic’s relations with
              the Arab States. At the moment these relations were good and quite correct despite the
              fact Germany was making reparations payments to Israel. The Federal Republic was
              anxious to prevent any deterioration of the relations, owing to the problem of
              preventing the recognition of the so-called German Democratic Republic. There was a
              danger that if these relations should worsen the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              might try to move into the vacuum in the interest of securing recognition or building
              up its own trade relations. The situation involved elements of blackmail. As for the
              British and French action in Suez, the Federal Republic had acted with restraint,
              although it regretted this development because it enabled the Soviet Union to pursue a
              policy of diversion in Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there was the matter of the Federal Republic’s relations with Israel. The
              Federal Republic wished to do nothing to upset reparations deliveries to Israel. He
              understood Ambassador Krekeler had made clear to us the Germans did not wish to
              suspend these deliveries even if a sanctions resolution should be voted in the United
              Nations. The German Parliament and people regarded this matter as a moral obligation
              rather than a political one. Any change in this policy would involve great
              difficulties and Brentano hoped that such a question would never be put to them. The
              Germans had informed the Israeli government that in view of their desire to maintain
              reparations deliveries they h oped they would not be confronted with a problem in this
              regard. He said he believed that the Israeli Government understood the viewpoint which
              had been expressed to them.</p>
            <p>Brentano then referred to the memorandum he had given to the Secretary in Paris on
              the overall situation in the Middle East.<note n="7" xml:id="d93fn7">See <ref
                  target="#d87fn4">footnote 4, Document 87</ref>.</note> As that memorandum had
              indicated, the Federal Republic was prepared to participate in any settlement of the
              problems of the area both because of its own interests in the area and the fact that
              such a settlement would help promote peace and stability in the world. The Federal
              Republic had welcomed the “bold and courageous” statement by President <persName
                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in setting forth his plan for the Middle
              East and was prepared to participate fully in this plan both from a political and
              economic standpoint.</p>
            <p>Brentano said he wished to give one illustration of the Federal Republic’s
              difficulties in the face of the Suez dispute. For over a year the Germans had planned
              to participate in a trade exhibition in Cairo which was to open very shortly. The
              Egyptians had proposed that the German Minister for Economic Affairs, Mr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName>, should go to <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"
              />Cairo to open the German exhibit. The German Cabinet had decided that this would not
              be a good time for Erhard to go but there was some fear that the Egyptians might make
              this a question of prestige. While Brentano felt himself that someone else should go,
              he would be glad to learn the Secretary’s views on this point.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Brentano said the Federal Republic was quite aware of the difficult
              position of Israel and would be glad to make any contribution it could toward an
              overall settlement in the Middle East which would help this small country to acquire a
              feeling of security. He suggested that perhaps some guarantee with regard to the Gulf
              of Aqaba could be worked into the Suez settlement. He wondered whether the Arabs
              themselves did not feel that such an overall settlement was necessary for their own
              economic and political purposes.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he was glad to notice Brentano’s reference to the
                <persName>Eisenhower</persName> doctrine,<note n="8" xml:id="d93fn8">For
                documentation on the American Doctrine for the Middle East
                  (<persName>Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine), approved by the President on March
                9,1957, see <ref target="frus1955-57v12">volume XII</ref>.</note> since he himself
              felt it would be a constructive step to counter Soviet activities in the Middle East.
              He Pointed out that the United States cannot carry alone the responsibility of
              developing relations with countries in this area advantageous to the West and that we
              looked forward to useful participation by the Federal Republic in this effort. He felt
              that the Federal Republic could play an important role in helping to develop the
              economy of the Middle East.</p>
            <p>As for the Erhard visit to Cairo, he agreed that this was not an appropriate time to
              send a high-ranking Cabinet Minister to Egypt, since <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1"
                >Nasser</persName> could play up this move as an indication of support for his
              viewpoint.</p>
            <p>Regarding an overall settlement in the area, we foresaw difficulties in proceeding
              quickly, in view of the high feeling between Israel and the Arab States. The United
              States was prepared to contribute in important ways to a settlement both economically
              and politically, as had been indicated in our statement in 1955, but it appeared
              doubtful whether an overall settlement could be reached within the next few
              months.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Turning to the second item on the agenda, the Secretary asked Mr. <persName>Von
                Brentano</persName> if he would like to speak on this item.</p>
            <p>Brentano said this item was of particular interest to the Germans. They felt some
              concern that the Middle East crisis tended to push the Eastern European problem into
              the background. They felt it was most important for us to keep in mind at all times
              that the principal field in the East-West struggle lay in Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p>Brentano said there were two related questions: (1) Do recent events in Eastern
              Europe compel us to make a change in our own policy toward the Soviet Union, and (2)
              should we follow a uniform policy toward the Soviet Union and the various satellites,
              with particular reference to Hungary and Poland?</p>
            <p>As for the Soviet Union Brentano felt that the effects of the Twentieth Party
              Congress and the de-Stalinization program were not yet clarified. The series of
              developments set in motion thereby were still going on. He was convinced, however,
              that no events had taken place which would justify us in deviating in any way from our
              present policy. Such changes as have taken place were merely in personages <pb n="209"
                xml:id="pg_209" facs="0237"/>and he was convinced that there had been no change
              whatever in the basic political objectives of the Soviet Union. He cited in this
              connection the Soviet November 17 proposals.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">For text of
                the Soviet declaration on disarmament, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                  >Bulletin</hi>, January 21, 1957, pp. 90–93.</note> and the <persName
                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interview with Alsop. He therefore
              considered it extremely dangerous, and he wished to be clear about this, to think now
              in terms of making concessions to the Soviet Union. He referred to various discussions
              now going on in certain quarters on the possibility of troop withdrawals,
              neutralization of Germany, establishment of a neutralized belt in Central Europe, etc.
              Brentano said that he wished to say frankly and firmly that, in the opinion of the
              Federal Government, any proposals along these lines would be extremely dangerous.</p>
            <p>Brentano then turned to the question of the satellites. In Hungary he said the will
              of the people had been turned back by brutal oppression and there appeared little that
              could be done to reverse this. He felt, however, that for humanitarian reasons
              something should be done to assist the Hungarian people even though in the process we
              might grant some measure of relief to the Soviets.</p>
            <p>In Poland, Brentano said, the line of development was not clear. He was not
              optimistic that Gomulka could maintain his position. He urged that we develop and
              maintain a common policy toward Poland and coordinate the implementation of the agreed
              policy. Unilateral action would be highly undesirable. In response to a question from
              the Secretary, Brentano made it clear that the coordination he had in mind involved
              not just the United States and the Federal Republic but the entire free world.</p>
            <p>Turning to the Soviet Zone of Germany Brentano referred to his conversation with the
              Secretary at Paris.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">See <ref target="#d87">Document
                  87</ref>.</note> He said that there was no immediate danger to a revolution there.
              The present stage of relative calm there was due primarily to the fact that the people
              still had hopes that developments in process would bring about German reunification
              and to their realization that any uprising would be immediately suppressed by the
              Soviets with brutal force as in Hungary. The principal danger would arise if there
              were a revolution in Poland which could spread to East Germany and produce another
              June 17.<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">See <ref target="#d57fn2">footnote 2, Document
                  57</ref>.</note> This was his great fear.</p>
            <p>Here again, Brentano emphasized, it was important that we coordinate our policies. He
              cited as an example of this need a recent shipment from the United States of 87,000
              tons of hard coal to the Soviet Zone via Hamburg. This created a difficult problem for
              the Federal Republic, which had been endeavoring to use the East Zone’s <pb n="210"
                xml:id="pg_210" facs="0238"/>need for hard coal as a political weapon in order to
              get some quid pro quo for any hard coal shipments. The Federal Republic has been
              giving substantial financial assistance to the hard-pressed Evangelical Church in East
              Germany. The East Zone regime had refused to permit this to continue unless it were
              supplied with hard coal by the Federal Republic and had arrested a man who was sent to
              the East Zone with 800,000 marks for the Evangelical Church. If the East Zone
              succeeded in getting hard coal from other sources the Federal Republic was deprived of
              a political weapon. Brentano asked the Secretary for his views on how we might best
              coordinate our policies on such matters.</p>
            <p>In reply to these points the Secretary said he agreed entirely on what Brentano had
              said about the situation in the Soviet Union. Despite the developments set off by the
              Twentieth Party Congress he felt nothing had happened which justified any change in
              our policies toward the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>As for Hungary, he also agreed with Brentano’s analysis and his concept that some
              humanitarian relief should be given to the Hungarian people even though that might
              involve some advantages to the Soviet Union. There was no point in protracting misery.
              If these relief measures could be administered in such a way that they could be
              identified as coming from the West, possibly the net balance would be in our own
              favor.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said the situation in Poland was different. He believed that the
              Government of Poland wished to gain some measure of independence from the Soviet
              Union. It obviously did not wish to do anything which would provoke what had happened
              in Hungary and it was not in our interest to do so. Our view was that the gradual
              development of Polish independence should be promoted by peaceful evolution rather
              than by violent revolution as in Hungary.</p>
            <p>The Secretary referred to the fact that a Polish Trade Mission is now in
                Washington.<note n="5" xml:id="d94fn5">For documentation on talks between the Polish
                Trade Mission and U.S. officials, February 26–June 7, see <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v25#pg_582">vol. XXV, pp. 582</ref> ff.</note> He said that the
              talks were as yet in an exploratory stage and no decisions had been reached. We felt
              it useful that Poland not feel entirely dependent economically on the Soviet Union and
              that it have some assurance the Soviets cannot destroy it by economic measures. The
              process of gradual evolution can be promoted by cautious steps along this line. It
              would be very useful to give the Poles a taste of what it is like to get economic
              support from the West. This might also make the Soviets realize the unwisdom of
              putting too much pressure on the Poles. With regard to economic aid to Poland at this
              time we are not thinking of anything of great magnitude. The principal commodities in
              which the Poles have indicated <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>interest are
              short-staple cotton, coal-mining machinery and wheat. We understand the Poles are also
              talking with the Canadians, the British and the French regarding the same
              commodities.</p>
            <p>As for the matter of coordination of this problem, probably the best forum was the
              North Atlantic Council. We have already made a preliminary statement there and will
              make a further one after the situation has developed. It would be useful if other
              countries could also discuss in the Council what steps they are taking. The Secretary
              said that he did not think coordination should be carried on in a way in which nothing
              is done until it is fully coordinated. He believed that what Brentano had in mind on
              this was the kind of talk they were having at the moment. Brentano nodded assent.</p>
            <p>As for the problem of coal shipments to East Germany, the Secretary thought the best
              place for coordinating the matter was in Bonn. He pointed out that <gloss
                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls were limited to strategic goods and that
              it was not so easy to control non-strategic items. He was sorry if the coal
              transaction had been embarrassing. While he was not sure we have the machinery to
              control this, we did recognize some primacy of interest on the part of the Federal
              Republic in the matter of trade with East Germany and we would try to work this
              problem out. Brentano said he thought this problem could be dealt with by the
              quadripartite Working Group in Bonn.</p>
            <p>The Secretary asked Brentano whether any thought was being given to the establishment
              of diplomatic relations with Poland by the Federal Republic. Brentano said there were
              groups in the Federal Republic urging that this step be taken. However, the Federal
              Government had taken a basic position against this. It was the Government’s policy not
              to recognize any government which recognized the German Democratic Republic. Only one
              exception had been made to this policy. That was in the case of the Soviet Union where
              it was felt the exception was justified because of the matter of repatriation of
              German war prisoners and because of the special responsibilities of the Soviet Union
              for the reunification of Germany.</p>
            <p>Brentano said he would be interested in the Secretary’s views as to whether
              establishment of diplomatic relations with Poland would be a good idea or not. One
              aspect to be borne in mind is that such a step might amount to a “kiss of death” for
              Gomulka. Brentano had recommended in the Bundestag Foreign Relations Committee that no
              steps be taken at this time toward recognition of the Polish Government and this would
              continue to be the Federal Government’s posture in the immediate future. At this time
              the Germans were thinking only in terms of limited economic assistance, without any
              overall trade agreement, in such commodities as grain. A figure of 200,000 tons was
              under discussion. It was conceivable that in the future trade missions could be
              exchanged which would have no political powers <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"
              />and would not involve diplomatic recognition. Any such step would be taken only in
              consultation with the other Powers.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that while this problem lay primarily within the competence of the
              Federal Republic, nevertheless since Brentano had asked his views on the establishment
              of diplomatic relations, he would consider it premature at the moment. He could see,
              if the evolutionary process should develop, that it might be helpful if it led to a
              discussion of the problem of the Polish-German frontier. The Soviet Union was in a
              position to bring pressure to bear on Poland by alleging that the frontiers would be
              changed to the disadvantage of Poland. This question had repercussions even in the
              United States, where there are substantial groups of Polish extraction. The time might
              come when it would be useful to do away with the fear that without Soviet support
              Poland would be dismembered. In any event he supposed it would probably not be
              fruitful to have this issue come to the fore before the coming elections in the
              Federal Republic. Brentano nodded assent.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that in response to any inquiries from the press it would be said that
              the Secretary and the Foreign Minister had had a useful exchange of views on the
              Middle East and Eastern Europe and that the discussions would be continued the next
              day.</p>

            <p>Mr. <persName>Von Brentano</persName> said he was sure the Secretary would understand
              that this subject (the third item on the agenda) was of special significance and
              importance to the Federal Republic. He believed they had agreed yesterday that there
              was no reason to change our policies in view of the absence of any evidence the
              Soviets had changed their policies. It was important that we make perfectly clear we
              have no intention of changing our policies. On the other hand it was also important
              that we not be guilty of rigidity and inflexibility. Great changes have taken place in
              the Soviet Union and these may present important possibilities. We must remain
              prepared to take advantage of them. Therefore we need on the one hand to continue our
              present policy with great determination, while on the other hand, we must remain
              flexible in our ideas and prepared for some Soviet initiative. Brentano said he
              personally expected such an initiative. While it might be designed primarily for
              propaganda purposes he foresaw that the Soviets might make some spectacular proposals
              within the context of the German election campaign which would go considerably beyond
              those in <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s recent letter to Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
            <p>Brentano felt it should be one of the special tasks and duties assigned to the
              Four-Power Working Group,<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">See <ref target="#d98">Document
                  98</ref>.</note> the creation of which he welcomed, to examine all the possible
              changes in order to be able if necessary to adjust our policies to changing
              conditions. It would be unfortunate if we were caught unprepared by any new Soviet
              initiative. It was also important to take into account public opinion on this subject
              in our two countries.</p>
            <p>The Secretary replied that he felt he need not say much on this subject beyond
              echoing Brentano’s remarks regarding the usefulness of the Working Group. He agreed
              that we must be prepared for proposals from the Soviets which might be spectacular, or
              seem to be, and we should be prepared to react quickly and in unison. He stressed the
              importance that the Working Group be identified primarily with the problem of German
              reunification rather than that of European security, in view of the interest of many
              other countries in <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0242"/>the latter question. We
              should avoid giving the impression that the Four Powers were setting up an executive
              committee to deal with political matters.</p>
            <p>Brentano agreed it was necessary to avoid the impression that the Working Group was
              forming policy on matters primarily within the competence of other organizations. At
              the recent <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meeting the Italian Foreign Minister
              had made rather suspicious inquiries about the purpose of the Working Group, but it
              had not proved difficult to allay his fears. Brentano had assured him that, if
              anything were decided, the North Atlantic Council would be informed. He had gone on to
              point out that the question of German reunification was inseparably linked to European
              security. He had said to Martino that it would be helpful for studies to be made in
              the first instance by those governments which would be responsible for signing a
              treaty on reunification. Brentano stressed that the question of reunification could
              not be treated in isolation but must be dealt with in relation to European security
              and European disarmament. Mr. <persName>Von Brentano</persName> referred to Mr.
                <persName>Ollenhauer</persName>’s recent visit to the United States.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d95fn3">See <ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> He said that ideas
              of a somewhat nebulous character were being put forward in certain circles. He thought
              that these ideas should be studied by the Working Group.</p>
            <p>Brentano said he felt we could avoid any misinterpretation by stressing that the
              Working Group would merely study the problem and was not authorized to make any
              decisions binding governments. He said he would welcome it if it could be indicated
              publicly that the Working Group would not terminate its studies after its initial
              session but would continue in being thereafter. This would make a good impression on
              public opinion in Germany. The Group could be somewhat smaller than presently
              constituted and could meet as necessary.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said it has always been his view that the Working Group would continue
              in existence almost indefinitely. One of its purposes was to deal with Soviet
              proposals when they came. We did not know when we could expect such proposals.
              Therefore the Working Group should continue in existence until it was decided to
              terminate it.</p>

            <p>Turning to the fifth agenda item on Western European Union, Brentano said he had only
              a few comments to make. In the recent <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> Ministerial
              Meeting in London the main question brought up had been the British plan for reducing
              their troops in Europe. It had been a good meeting, and there had been a frank and
              objective discussion of this problem. The other members of <gloss target="#t_WEU1"
                >WEU</gloss> had expressed very serious misgivings about the British plans. For one
              thing, the presence of British forces on the Continent had been an essential
              pre-condition for the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> treaty coming into being..
              Brentano mentioned his fear of a chain reaction being set off by this British move,
              which could be disastrous vis-à-vis the Soviet Union because the Soviets might
              interpret this as the start of unilateral disarmament by the West. It had been the
              consensus of the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> meeting that this problem must be
              dealt with in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, although there was a problem
              about timing. He said it would be appreciated if the United States would set forth its
              views on this subject when the matter came up in the North Atlantic Council on the
              coming Friday.</p>
            <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0244"/>
            <p>The Secretary replied that we shared the concern expressed by Brentano but were not
              quite sure how the problem could best be dealt with. We had the impression that the
              British position was very firm and that they had concluded that their financial
              situation is such that they must take this step. We were aware that the Federal
              Republic was prepared to help alleviate the British financial problem but the British
              seemed determined to go ahead anyway. The Secretary said it was a difficult situation.
              It did not involve a voluntary contribution since it was specifically provided for in
              the Brussels Treaty. It would be unfortunate if there had to be important changes in
              this respect. The Secretary agreed there might be repercussions elsewhere. On the
              other hand, we must recognize that the United Kingdom does face serious financial
              strains. Even though the United Kingdom has treaty engagements, these engagements do
              not provide it with the resources to carry them out. He believed we must accept as
              inevitable the fact that there will be important reductions in British forces in
              Europe and try to see to it that these reductions are brought about as gradually as
              possible and as consistent as possible with the strategic concepts and military views
              of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>. We had expressed this view to Mr.
                <persName>Sandys</persName> when he had visited Washington. The Secretary said he
              hoped there was some flexibility in the British position, but he was not too
              optimistic as to the degree. He feared they had taken pretty definitive decisions.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we would do what we could at the meeting on Friday. He felt
              there was nothing to be gained by putting the UK in the position where it must openly
              make a breach in its treaty obligations. This would not be a healthy development in
              our relations. He said that we as members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
              the Germans as members of <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> would have to adapt our
              convictions to the hard realities of the situation. He agreed there would be
              repercussions, certainly in Europe and possibly also in the United States. Our
              original formula had been that we would carry our fair share of the whole. He did not
              know what the application of this would be to the new situation. He did not think it
              would lead to any change in our plans, certainly not as to the Executive Branch. He
              could not guarantee what the reaction would be in Congress.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that in connection with the reaction in Congress it was important
              that we have good news from Germany regarding the build-up of its own military
              strength. He assumed this was going forward as fast as possible within the framework
              of the present exigencies of the political situation. However, it was not as fast as
              we had hoped.</p>
            <p>Brentano replied that as of January 1, 1957 the Germans had 70,000 men in uniform. By
              the end of this year the figure would be 135,000. By July 1, 1957, three infantry
              divisions would be organized <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>and by the end
              of the year two armored divisions, two naval squadrons, and two air transport wings.
              In addition, by the first of next year sufficient cadres would have been trained to
              enable the Germans to build up their tactical units in greater strength. Brentano said
              the figures he had given were definitive and he felt the Germans were making
              considerable progress.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then said that our own plans do not call for any reduction in our troop
              strength in Germany, although there may be some adaptation in the structure of our
              divisions in Germany as in the case of those at home. The Secretary asked Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> to speak on this point. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> said that the reorganization of our
              divisions had been under study for some time. Cuts in actual division strength of
              2,000 to 3,000 men would be involved, depending on whether the division was infantry
              or armored. The surplus of personnel, however, would be absorbed into support units
              for artillery or new weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName>
              stated that our plans for fiscal year 1958 which had just been approved called for no
              cuts in personnel in Germany.</p>

            <p>After greeting Minister Brentano, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                >Eisenhower</persName> mentioned the Government’s desire to have Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> visit the U.S. in late May. He read
              to the Minister a statement regarding the invitation to Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> which he said would be given to the press
              following this morning’s talk, if Brentano approved.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">For

                of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 6, 1957, p. 719.</note> The Minister
              indicated his complete agreement with the announcement.</p>
            <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0246"/>
            <p>Minister Brentano expressed his regret that President Heuss had been obliged to
              cancel his expected visit to Washington. In reply to the President’s question,
              Brentano stated that the President is recovering from his illness and is now able to
              be up and about for several hours each day.</p>
            <p>The Minister said that he was very satisfied with the talks that he had had with
              Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> which had served to reaffirm
              the identity of views between the two Governments on matters of mutual concern. He
              could assure the President that the Federal Republic of Germany would continue in the
              course that it had heretofore followed, knowing that it could count on the support of
              the U.S. He expressed the view that the U.S., as the greatest Western Power, must
              maintain the leadership of the free world for some time to come. The President
              acknowledged the validity of the Minister’s observation. He said that Europe one day
              will be able to stand on its own feet. He referred approvingly to the European
              integration movement and said that the combined skills and resources of Europe will be
              forged, through integration of the Western countries, into a third force which will
              ensure the salvation of the Western world. Brentano said that he preferred not to use
              the expression “third force” since it is a term which was often misused as indicating
              that Europe would provide a balance of power as between the East and the West. He felt
              that Europe must align itself on the Western side, to which the President agreed.</p>
            <p>The President referred to the forthcoming spring meeting of the North Atlantic
              Council and was pleased to know that the meeting would take place in Bonn. He said
              that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is in good shape with respect to policy but
              that it was undergoing certain economic difficulties. Brentano referred to the
              contemplated reductions in British forces in Europe and wondered if <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could deal with this very difficult problem. The
              President said he saw no reason for pessimism with respect to the future of <gloss

                >NATO</gloss> partners differ occasionally on policy but are aware that their best
              interests dictate unity of action and purpose. He referred to the recent Suez crisis
              as an “accident of the road”. These accidents, he said, would occur from time to time
              but should not destroy the effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
            <p>The President commented very favorably on the elimination of the Saar problem as
              marking a decisive step forward in relations between France and Germany and the

            <p>There was some discussion of the Eastern European satellite countries and Brentano
              commented on the effect of recent developments there on the Eastern Zone of Germany.
              The President felt that the “law of gravity” in politics would draw the Eastern
              countries toward the West and that the liberation of the satellites would result.
              Brentano agreed though he expressed some fear that the Soviets might try to turn the
              clock back. The President said that he felt that as the West grows strong the Soviet
              Government will grow more careful.</p>

            <p>Between March 6 and 15, a Four-Power Working Group, composed of representatives of
              the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Federal
              Republic of Germany, met in Washington to discuss the problems of German reunification
              in relation to European security. The group, formed early in 1957, considered these

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In a note dated February 23, 1957,
              presented by the United States Embassy here,<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">Not found in
                Department of State files.</note> your Government has expressed the wish that the
              Federal Republic pay the United States, as was the case last year, an amount of DM 650
              Million or $155 Million by way of contribution towards the costs of stationing United
              States Forces in the Federal Republic. A reply to this note was conveyed today to the
              Department of State. In view of the fact that the United States note was addressed to
              me you will permit me, I am sure, to express some additional comments to you.</p>
            <p>For one thing I should like to emphasize that the Federal Republic’s obligation to
              pay “support costs” expired last year. Our two governments agree on this point. We are
              now acting on the basis of Article 3 of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              treaty on measures of mutual aid; these measures—according to an accepted practice
              among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, which is surely known to
              you—are to be regarded as voluntary.</p>
            <p>To the Federal Republic it means a great sacrifice that it is now to pay DM 1.200
              Million out of its defense budget for defense efforts other than its own; this
              diversion of funds renders more difficult its own rearmament efforts. An increase
              would considerably slow down the speed of German rearmament. This would conflict not
              only with the German interest but also with that of the Allies— particularly at a time
              when Britain prepares to reduce her forces on the continent.</p>
            <p>Nor is it possible for me now to increase the defense budget as a whole. The
              financial burden imposed by defense expenditures on the Federal Republic today is no
              less than that borne by other countries in a comparable position.</p>
            <p>Let me recall only that before the end of this year the Federal Government will place
              at the disposal of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> three motorized infantry
              divisions and two armored divisions. You will also understand that it is impossible
              for me to increase the defense budget, at any rate in this year when my alliance and
              defense policies are particularly exposed to debate and controversy.</p>
            <p>In allocating the amount of DM 1.2 billion we have considered in the first place
              those countries which are in need of special assistance, and here it was primarily
              Britain. This is because we recognize <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0249"
              />Britain’s difficulties and because we see in the British plans for a reduction of
              forces a grave threat not only to the Federal Republic but to the entire Western
              Defense Community. The Council of Ministers of <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> has
              now succeeded with great difficulty to achieve a provisional, reasonably satisfactory
              compromise. In this connection it was of great importance that Britain could look to
              the German-British financial arrangement as a result of which Britain has largely been
              relieved of its foreign exchange and financial difficulties with regard to the
              stationing of forces. If this arrangement, however, is now placed in jeopardy the
              agreement reached in London will also be in danger.</p>
            <p>I know that your Government is far from desiring such a situation. In practice,
              however, the upholding of your request would have this effect, since it is not
              possible—for the reasons explained by me—to implement both the Anglo-German
              arrangements and to meet the American request,—quite apart from the fact that the
              other countries maintaining forces in the Federal Republic would, of course, increase
              their requests in turn.</p>
            <p>Let me address to you, my dear Mr. President, the urgent request for an early
              decision which takes account of the grave anxieties which I feel with regard to the
              future of the Western Defense Community.</p>
            <p>With my best wishes and regards, I am,</p>

              financial support which the Federal Government had offered for United States troops in
              Germany. The Ambassador also gave the Secretary of State a letter from the Chancellor
              to the President on this subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d100fn4"><ref target="#d99"><hi
                    rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note></p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler said he had been instructed to inform the Secretary that the
              Chancellor had reviewed the problem with great care. He was very sorry, but he felt it
              would be impossible to allocate more than the DM 1.200 million which had been
              established with the agreement of Parliament for the support of visiting forces in the
              Federal Republic. The Chancellor felt that it was impossible to ask the Parliament for
              an increase in this amount. He had asked the Ambassador to point out that this problem
              had a special bearing on the elections and asked that the difficulties of the Federal
              Government be viewed with understanding. He pointed out that the Federal Government
              was going forward with its military build-up and would assign five divisions to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> this year.</p>
            <p>The Secretary noted that the Federal Government took the position that the defense
              burden which it was carrying was comparable to that being borne by other countries.
              The Ambassador said that this point was elaborated on in the note. While the Federal
              Government admitted that Great Britain was bearing a heavier burden, it felt that the
              Federal Government was bearing a burden equal to that of France, and higher than that
              of Belgium and The Netherlands.</p>
            <p>The Secretary asked whether the Federal Government felt that it was bearing a burden
              as heavy as that of the United States. The Ambassador said he felt that the position
              of the Federal Government and the United States were different. The Secretary remarked
              that the American gold reserves were going down, whereas the German gold reserves were
              going up.</p>
            <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by saying that he had been informed by
              representatives of the Defense Department that this matter had recently been discussed
              in the Congressional committees concerned, which had expressed considerable
              unhappiness with what was being done and strong criticism of what had been offered.
              The Ambassador said that the Federal Republic had a problem in this respect, as well,
              since it would have to have the consent of Parliament for any increase in the amounts
              of funds which had been allocated for the support of visiting forces.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he and the President were sympathetic with the problems
              confronting the Federal Republic in this particular year. He said that the German note
              would be carefully studied.</p>

            <p>I enclose herewith a communication from Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> to you, as received by me today from the German
                Ambassador.<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2"><ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note>
              This deals with the matter of German contribution to the support of American troops in
              Germany. The Germans have offered us $77 million, which is half of what we received
              last year, and we have asked for what we got last year.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador said he was instructed also to transmit orally the Chancellor’s
              personal assurance to you that he had studied this matter very carefully and was
              genuinely convinced that it was impossible to do more this year. The funds allocated
              for the financial support of foreign forces in the Federal Republic with parliamentary
              agreement will be exhausted by the contemplated contributions to the United Kingdom,
              France, and the United States. The principal contribution is to the United Kingdom,
              which will receive considerably more than last year, but somewhat less than what the
              British estimate they need completely to cover their troop expenditures in Germany.
              However, the United Kingdom agreement is not being finalized until it is known that
              the United States will accept the German offer. Any increased payment to us would
              probably be at the expense of the United Kingdom and would have a serious impact upon
              the whole matter of stationing United Kingdom troops on the continent. You may recall
              that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> urged that we should take action
              which would permit of finalizing the United Kingdom-German agreement.</p>
            <p>It is, I believe, the view of the Defense Department that we should insist upon
              getting more. I think that under a “capacity-to-pay” test the Germans should pay more.
              However, we in the State Department feel quite clearly that the political price of
              getting more would be excessive. It would either require the Chancellor to go back and
              get an additional appropriation, which would be politically very hazardous for him, or
              require the British to give up to us some of the amounts which are now to be paid
              them. This would be costly from the standpoint of our United Kingdom relations.</p>
            <p>I therefore recommend that we acquiesce in the Chancellor’s proposal. But perhaps
              before deciding this finally, you may want to have a meeting with Defense and State to
              hear Defense’s viewpoint <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>which will also
              reflect, I believe, a Congressional view that we should try to get the Germans to pay
                more.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3"><p>On March 28, President <persName

                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. The transcript of the conversation reads in
                  part as follows: “The President said there was one question that was not covered
                  by State—that is what Germany proposes to do for the French as compared with the
                  past. Said France has taken most of troops out and sent them to Algeria and he did
                  not see any reason why France would be given a favored position.</p>
                <p>“President asked if Secretary had talked directly to Charlie Wilson on this—and
                  when the Secretary was going to take it up. Apparently the Secretary said he would
                  do so, and talk to President later.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, DDE

            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said there were two essentially separate issues to
              discuss—German support costs and the reduction of our forces in Germany</p>
            <p>Regarding the first, the German contribution to the cost of supporting our forces in
              Europe, a good case can be made that the Germans could pay more. They have, however,
              already budgeted a definite amount. If we press them to increase the contribution for
              U.S. forces, the Germans will certainly cut their payments to the United Kingdom and
              to France. The result will be ill will toward us on the part of the French and the
              British, and we will in the end have to help them out to a considerable extent in
              compensation. The German budget provided rather liberally for the French and the
              British—as we pressed them to do—but they allocated to us only one-half of what we
              received last year.</p>
            <p>Secretary Robertson then reviewed the matter from the standpoint of the Defense
              Department for the President, utilizing a memorandum <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                facs="0253"/>of which a copy is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">Not found in
                Department State files.</note> He said that Congressional opinion is so strong on
              this matter that it may affect adversely our aid program proposals. He suggested we
              should point this fact out to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, and
              present the question to him as one of equitable mutual security contributions. At his
              request Mr. <persName>McNeil</persName> then reviewed charts showing the increase in
              German economic strength over the past several years. He said the Germans could afford
              an increase without difficulty as a mutual defense contribution, and confirmed that
              Congress is taking a very stiff position on this matter.</p>
            <p>Both Mr. <persName>McNeil</persName> and Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> referred
              to the “slippage” in German rearmament effort.</p>
            <p>The President recalled that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is coming
              up for election this fall. He said he feels that <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> generally wants to go forward with collective defense effort,
              including the German rearmament, but he is limited in how much he can attempt.
              Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he too thought that
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is trying hard and honestly to make
              good on the rearmament program. It is not a question of his will. The short-fall is
              simply a measure of the real political difficulties he is experiencing. It has been
              very hard for him to go forward with the program, and to obtain any conscription law
              at all. By pressing him, we may risk what we are seeking to gain. The President asked
              if we should not say to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that, if this
              is all they plan to contribute to the support of U.S. forces, and plan to do
              themselves, we will have to reexamine our deployments next year. Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> had described the program to him in December.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d102fn3">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of
                State files.</note> It sounded like a good program. Five divisions by 30 June 1957,
              two additional by the first of January 1958, and five more “soon.” Later, evidence
              began to appear of a cutback, culminating in messages from Bonn two months ago
              indicating that <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> is not going to do
              what he said he would. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he
              thought the United States had been the victim of some sharp practice in this
              matter.</p>
            <p>The President said the real question was as to how this matter would affect the
              election. He said he is ready to write a letter setting forth the whole thing. He
              added that he felt Congress would be more inclined to accept the situation if German
              defense effort were rising rapidly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
              pointed out that, for the Germans to increase their contribution, they would have to
              go back to the Bundestag for an appropriation. Funds cannot be transferred from their
              own defense effort to support costs. The President said we must find some way to
              establish our position with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. He
              recognized that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> might well not publish
              what was sent. We could <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0254"/>report what Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said. We might say that we will wait
              until next year to press the matter further, but we could add that we feel they should
              contribute an additional amount, and that we intend to insist upon it. Mr.
                <persName>McNeil</persName> said it might be possible to apply the $77 million they
              are contributing to the period from May until November, and let them know we will seek
              additional funds then. The President suggested that we might say to <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that we will have to review the matter at the
              end of the year. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he would try to draft a reply to
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in collaboration with Defense. He
              said it was very important to the British to get the situation settled. He felt we
              should acquiesce in what the Germans are contributing to the British. The President
              said we should tell the Germans that they cannot satisfy us by taking funds from the
              British and French contributions. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said we should try
              to get the Germans to accept the British arrangement as definitive.</p>
            <p>The group next took up the subject of force skills and deployments. Mr.
                <persName>Robertson</persName> said that for forward planning for <gloss
                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–59 Defense wanted to pull out some men and units from
              Europe. There was discussion of the renewal of the fighter wing, and certain
              antiaircraft and other elements from the United Kingdom. The President indicated he
              associated this with the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>, and this point was
              clarified after discussion. He said that we should make clear that we are trying to
              help the British out with regard to foreign exchange burdens, but that we feel that
              they could take over a unit which is going to be stationed within the UK itself.</p>
            <p>The President asked why we cannot streamline divisions and cut down backup troops
              without public announcement. It could be done on a worldwide basis, avoiding the
              connotation of pulling out of Europe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said it is not planned to touch major units, but
              to cut down administrative elements, and the President said he is all for cuts of this
              kind. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said we should let our
              allies know that we will be cutting numbers. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                >Dulles</persName> recalled that, in the December <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> meeting, he announced that there would be a change in numbers without
              reducing the strength of units and without removing major units. He saw no need to
              make any public announcement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
              said he assumed Defense would keep in close touch with <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1"
                >SACEUR</gloss> on this matter, and Secretary Robertson undertook to do so.
              Secretary Robertson said that the British are giving a lot of publicity to the
              withdrawal of our anti-aircraft units (which are armed with weapons now becoming
              obsolete), and there was some thought that they were doing so to divert attention from
              their own cutbacks. The President asked what weapons will be used against low-flying
              aircraft, and some of the new missile developments were discussed with him.</p>
            <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>
            <p>The President then took up his views regarding the desirability of having the British
              get the German tank order for their Centurion tanks. Mr.
                <persName>Robertson</persName> said that Defense had received a statement of the
              President’s view and policies had been adjusted to that in Defense, and in the Army
              too. Germany, however, is leaning toward the M–48 tank. Secretary <persName
                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said a message had just been received indicating
              that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> had announced his decision in
              favor of the M–48. The President expressed himself very strongly on this matter. He
              said he had understood that the Germans were going to buy Centurions (this
              understanding was apparently based on a statement by Minister Blank); German military
              men had opposed this decision, and it appeared that it was being reversed. The
              President said he could find many ways to influence the Germans toward the Centurion.
              There was discussion which indicated that our services had, in a degree, facilitated
              German consideration of the M–48. Mr. <persName>McNeil</persName> said that the matter
              of delivery schedules was still open. The President said it looked to him as though
              someone had decided to sell M–48s in spite of the President’s ideas. He said if such
              was not the case, they had not been very clever in their methods.</p>
            <p>Secretary Robertson finally said that, in addition to pulling out administrative
              personnel and some administrative units, it might be necessary to pull out certain
              combat support units. The President said it would be best simply to pull out men as
              part of a worldwide tightening-up operation, not as a cutback in European
              strength.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chancellor</hi>: I have received your letter of March
              25, 1957<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Presumably a reference to <ref target="#d99"
                  >Document 99</ref>.</note> with regard to the German contribution to the costs of
              supporting American forces in the Federal Republic. I appreciate your having gone into
              the matter personally and am glad that you have written me on the subject.</p>
            <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0256"/>
            <p>I can understand that this problem involves difficulties for you. Frankly it also
              involves serious political difficulties for my Administration. Our defense budget is
              now being considered by the Congress. As you probably know, we ran into substantial
              difficulty with the Congress last year regarding the amount of financial support which
              the Federal Republic gave to our forces. The Congress was very critical of the
              agreement which we made with you last year, and there has been increased criticism
              this year of the arrangements which your Government has proposed to us.</p>
            <p>The criticism stems basically from the fact that our Congress does not feel that the
              Federal Republic has been carrying its fair share of the burden of defending the
              Atlantic Community, either in financial terms or as regards the actual contribution of
              forces. Our figures indicate that the defense burden borne by the Federal Republic has
              been substantially less than that of the average for other European <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and far less than the burden being carried
              by the United States. While I recognize that the buildup of military forces by the
              Federal Republic is now under way, progress has been considerably slower than we had
              been led to expect by earlier statements by the Federal Government. Our agreement to
              the current level of support for our forces was based in large measure on the
              increased burden to the Federal Republic that was expected to result from a rapid
              buildup of military forces, which has not materialized. Moreover it is not clear to us
              that steps are being taken which will in fact lead to the creation of the forces which
              we understood as recently as the conversation between Defense Minister <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                >Radford</persName> in December 1956 would be established.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d103fn3">No record of this conversation has been found in Department of
                State files.</note></p>
            <p>At the same time, as you are aware, the already heavy burden of our defense budget
              has been rising and we are encountering increasing difficulty in meeting fully all of
              the varied military requirements which our own position in the world imposes upon us.
              The current level of DM support covers only a fraction of the total cost of equipping
              and maintaining the United States Forces in Germany, and any further reduction in the
              level of support would directly increase our already rising defense costs. These
              circumstances create a political problem for us which I can assure you is a very
              genuine one.</p>
            <p>I have been glad to learn from your letter of the importance which you attach to the
              arrangements which you have worked out with the British. I hope that these
              arrangements, and those which you have made with the French, can be brought to a final
              conclusion as soon as possible. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                >Macmillan</persName> mentioned to me at Bermuda his concern regarding this
                matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">For documentation on the conversations at

                facs="0257"/>conclusion of these arrangements should be held up by our
              negotiations.</p>
            <p>When we concluded the arrangements on this subject with your Government last year,
              our negotiators made it clear that our agreement to the amount of support which you
              offered for our forces was premised on our expectation that the buildup of German
              forces would proceed rapidly. It was understood we were free to raise the issue of
              further support in the future if, in our judgment, the circumstances warranted.</p>
            <p>In view of our respective political problems, it occurs to me that we might approach
              the matter on somewhat the same basis as that employed last year. This might permit us
              to accept the lump-sum payment which your Government has offered us. It would be
              regarded as a payment “on account” so that the entire subject could be reviewed again
              in six months’ time. This suggestion might provide the way out of our immediate
              problems. Meanwhile, your forthcoming trip to Washington will give us an opportunity
              to discuss all these problems personally.</p>

            <p>4185. Personal for the Secretary from Bruce.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">David K.E.
                Bruce was appointed Ambassador to Germany on March 14 and presented his credentials
                on March 17.</note> Chancellor recalled Hallstein to Bonn this morning. After long
              conversation between themselves, Hallstein sent for me and asked that following
              message from Chancellor be communicated to you immediately.</p>
            <p>Chancellor was informed yesterday that Department of Justice intended shortly to
              offer for sale American securities representing ownership of Stinnes Works in Ruhr
              area. Chancellor had referred to this matter, although not specifically by name, in
              his letter of March <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0258"/>26, 1957, to President
                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">This
                letter discussed the question of German prewar assets in the United States.
                (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, <persName
                  corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to <persName>Eisenhower</persName>)</note>
              Stinnes case in his opinion is unique in connection with disposition of German assets
              in United States—is only instance where all physical property is located in Germany.
              Moreover majority of stock of company is owned by German citizens actually resident in
              Germany although other members of Stinnes family domiciled in America have minority
              interest.</p>
            <p>There are 30,000 workers in the various Stinnes plants with a considerable Communist
              minority amongst them. These Communists have been hopefully expectant of some such
              action as is now reported to be contemplated by the United States Government. In
              addition other political elements unfavorable to him will capitalize on issue.</p>
            <p>He attaches very great importance to this affair in connection with his campaign. He
              feels that in the Bundestag as well he will be bitterly criticized for not having been
              able to negotiate more successfully in this regard with the United States Government.
              He wonders if the administration could not decide to put off any final decision in
              this case until after the German election. That will give him a chance to say he is
              still making representations in this regard and will as well (for your private
              information) try to develop plans in case the ultimate decision is completely adverse
              which might include an attempt to have German interests buy in the securities at
              public sale.</p>

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Election Prospects</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary asked the Chancellor how he thought the elections would come out. The
              Chancellor replied that he thought that the prospects were good—the other parties of
              the coalition were now coming closer to the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>,
              though there were still grounds for caution in assessing prospects. The Chancellor
              remarked that the Russians had “dropped their bomb” regarding atomic weapons much too
              early in the German election campaign.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">For text of the
                letter from the Soviet Government to the Federal Republic, dated April 27, 1957, see
                  <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 245–249.</note> The Secretary said that
              Adlai Stevenson had made an issue of atomic tests during the American election last
              fall. The Soviets had sent a note in support of his position,<note n="3"
                xml:id="d105fn3">Not further identified.</note> and this had not helped Stevenson at
              all. The Secretary added that one can almost count on the Russians to make tactical
              errors of this kind in dealing with elections.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated that, in considering the forthcoming German election, a
              principal factor was the effect on German public opinion of the past war and the
              consequent great fear of any new war. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> was
              doing its best to exploit this feeling. The Chancellor continued that he had seen a
              brochure on Ollerihauer’s visit to the United States, however, and had noted that
              Ollenhauer had never spoken about the issue of atomic weapons there—and the American
              press had not even questioned him on it.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Atomic Weapons</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> takes the position
              that the Federal Republic should have no atomic weapons and that the Allies should not
              keep them on German territory. This view, the Chancellor said, was completely
              senseless. The Chancellor said that the United States, as the principal power which
              has undertaken the responsibility of protecting Germany, must have the right to
              determine its own weapons. The Chancellor felt that steps should be taken to make this
              point plain for all to understand. He suggested that between now and the time of his
              visit to the United States, the Secretary give some consideration to the kinds of
              statements which might be made.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he had made a somewhat similar statement in his press
              conference that morning. He had wished to make clear his view that, unless an
              international agreement on disarmament <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0260"/>can be
              obtained, the development of atomic weapons must continue. Naturally, all efforts for
              controlled disarmament must be made. But abstention from development of atomic weapons
              under present circumstances would be like undertaking to face any enemy’s rifles with
              bows and arrows.</p>
            <p>With reference to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting, the
              Secretary said that he had been surprised and impressed by the reluctance of other
              Western nations to see atomic weapons abolished.</p>
            <p>Von Brentano said that he had received no hint of such a feeling from French Foreign
              Minister Pineau, with whom he had had a completely frank conversation that morning. He
              said that Pineau’s feeling, on the contrary, was that the defense of Europe should not
              be left entirely to non-continental European powers, and should not be allowed to
              depend too greatly upon Great Britain, in particular.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that his main concern in the military field was with relations
              with the United Kingdom, and that there were no reasons for worrying about relations
              with the French. He referred to confidential conversations and exchanges of letters
              with Premier Mollet some time ago, and said that it had been agreed that French and
              German military staffs and individual officers be brought together as much as
              possible, to prevent the development of differences. <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> emphasized this by referring to the Protocol of January 18, 1957
              on technical military cooperation between France and Germany, which confirmed this
              proposal and established a committee.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">German Relations With Italy</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that, likewise, the Federal Republic’s relations with Italy,
              including his personal relations with Italian statesmen, could hardly be better. He
              had assured Foreign Minister Martino that Italy would not be pushed aside as a weaker
              power. He also enjoyed excellent relations with Segni and Fanfani. The Secretary
              remarked that Fanfani was indeed a good man, but that President Gronchi was something
              else. The Chancellor replied that Segni, Martino and Fanfani had also expressed the
              latter view and had in fact “opened their hearts” to him about Gronchi.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he felt the Western nations should consider having the Italians
              participate more fully on matters which could be handled on a five-power basis. The
              Chancellor said that he could indeed understand Italy’s feelings in this respect. Von
              Brentano, however, suggested that any steps in this direction must be taken with
              caution, because of the parallel feelings of the Benelux nations. He noted that there
              had been many signs of jealousy on their part resulting from Germany’s excellent
              relations with France. The Chancellor stated, conclusively, that good German-French
              relations were <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0261"/>of first importance, and that
              other nations would have to accommodate themselves to this principle.</p>
            <p>The Western nations must think of ways, the Secretary continued, to satisfy the pride
              of the Italians—small measures would suffice, it was not necessary to do too much.
              Last year, he recalled, the Italians had been very pleased to be included on the
              committee considering the shipment of arms to the Middle East. Even though the
              effectiveness of the committee had come to nought because of the French, the Italians
              had not forgotten this favor. The Secretary asked the Chancellor to give him any
              suggestions along these lines which might occur to him in the course of events. The
              Chancellor remarked that these questions could be discussed completely frankly with
              Italian leaders, even with Saragat.</p>
            <p>The discussion then proceeded to a number of points which the Chancellor had listed
              on a personally hand-written agenda.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soviet Penetration of the Mediterranean</hi></p>
            <p>Indicating that he had not yet had a chance to discuss this matter with Von Brentano,
              the Chancellor said he was concerned that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              Ministerial Conference had failed to discuss Soviet penetration of the Mediterranean
              area and the consequent dangers, particularly for Italy. He said that Segni had
              brought this up with him years before. The Chancellor continued that Soviet designs on
              the Mediterranean area, part of a vast pincer movement against Western Europe, were
              presumably one of the bases for the recent Soviet intervention in the Middle East
              crisis.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Middle East</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary said that there was no doubt about Soviet ambitions to obtain control
              of the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The German documents captured in Berlin
              showed that conversations between <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and
              Hitler regarding a possible division of the world into three spheres of influence had
              broken up on the issue of <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s insistence
              on control of the Persian Gulf area. At the first Council of Foreign Ministers meeting
              in 1945, furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had demanded a
              Soviet trusteeship of Tripolitania.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that the Soviets had undoubtedly made some progress in penetrating
              Egypt and Syria, and Syria today must be considered as almost having reached the
              status of a Soviet satellite. If the British and the French had pursued their
              ill-fated venture in the Middle East, the Soviets would undoubtedly have become the
              dominant power in the Arab world. Now that the United States had taken the problem of
              the Middle East in hand, however, the Secretary expected a reduction of Soviet
              influence in the long run. The British had made too many of the kind of errors which a
              nation is inclined <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>to make when it has become
              weak but believes it must appear strong—such as the seizure of Buraimi and the effort
              to force Jordan into the Baghdad Pact. The Secretary said that the temptation to use
              force was always at hand, but that the United States believed that the problems of the
              Middle East could be peacefully worked out in time and Soviet influence reduced. He
              said that the beginnings of a reduction of Soviet influence in Jordan could now be
              perceived, and there was a much improved relationship with Saudi Arabia. He expected
              that the situations in Syria and Egypt would eventually change to Western advantage.
              The whole problem of Soviet influence in the Middle East would be easy to handle, the
              Secretary continued, if it were not for Israeli-Arab enmity. In summary, the Secretary
              felt that, with inevitable fluctuations, the trend in the Middle East problem was
              toward improvement.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic Assistance in the Middle East</hi></p>
            <p>The Federal Republic ought to be able to assist in extending economic assistance to
              the Middle East, the Secretary said to the Chancellor. Germany is now free from any
              colonial taint. On long-term economic development projects in this area, the Secretary
              said, the Federal Republic and the United States should work more closely together
              than has been the case in the past.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor replied that he agreed to this general proposition, and that the
              Federal Republic was in principle prepared to proceed with projects. He referred to
              his recent visit to Tehran at the invitation of the Shah, a man who, he said, was to
              be taken seriously. The Shah had requested German-Iranian cooperation in the field of
              economic development, and in his reply the Chancellor had stated that it would be
              necessary to have capital participation from other countries, particularly the United
              States. In specific industrial projects, the Chancellor felt that German nationals
              should not take on the leading jobs—this would cause future difficulties in relations
              with Iran. The outcome of the discussions had been the formation of a joint committee
              of experts located in Iran and charged with formulation of specific recommendations.
              On the basis of such recommendations, the Chancellor would consult once again with the
              Shah. (The Secretary remarked at this point that the Iranians could use a tough German
              tax collector. The Chancellor: Should we give up Schaeffer?) The Chancellor noted that
              the British press had been “very impolite” about his visit to Iran, though he felt he
              could hardly have done anything there to arouse British antagonism.</p>
            <p>The Iranians had demonstrated in their talks with the Chancellor particular interest
              in a project for a pipeline direct to Turkey (not through Iraq). The Chancellor said
              he hoped that, if the Germans should decide on some practical projects, the United
              States would be <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0263"/>ready to participate in them
              also, The Secretary asked whether the Chancellor had in mind American governmental
              assistance or investment by private enterprise. The Chancellor said that he meant
              assistance through private investment, and the Secretary added he considered this to
              be better.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor continued that he could not quite agree with the approach suggested by
              Special Ambassador Richards,<note n="4" xml:id="d105fn4">For documentation on the
                Richards Mission to the Middle East, see <ref target="frus1955-57v12">volume
                  XII</ref>.</note> who, he thought, was recommending too fast a start. For example,
              according to the Chancellor, Richards has suggested to the Iranians that they invest
              in a steel mill with the capacity of 300,000–400,000 tons—a project which the
              Chancellor considered totally unrealistic. The Secretary replied that this might have
              been a misunderstanding. The Chancellor said that he had heard this from the Shah, who
              had made a perfectly clear statement as he had just retold it. The Chancellor wondered
              whether the Iranians were exaggerating matters in order to encourage the Germans to
              take bolder steps. The Secretary said that this kind of thing had been done before,
              and that he was always glad to have such a cross-check on statements by third
              countries. The Chancellor then said that when he had gone into the matter more closely
              with the Shah, it had appeared to him that Richards must have been talking about steel
              mills in the United States.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military Policy</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he had received the news the previous day that Great Britain
              would no longer call up draftees from the class of 1940. If this had indeed now been
              stated so precisely by the British, the Chancellor said, then Germany was confronted
              by a very grave situation. The Chancellor said that he was currently very concerned by
              the mass of Soviet troops in the Soviet Zone of Germany. Recent British actions, said
              the Chancellor, had sharpened the necessity for him to clarify his views on atomic
              weapons for the Bundeswehr. (He commented in this connection that his views on this
              subject as published in the press were almost always subjected to some distortion, and
              he specifically named the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le
                Figaro</hi> as offending newspapers.) In the wake of the story of the scientists’
              statement on atomic weapons, and of the emotional reaction of the Evangelical Church,
              particularly under the leadership of Niemoeller, he wanted to make plain once again
              the following points: <list>
                <label>1)</label>
                <item>The Federal Republic has no atomic weapons.</item>
                <label>2)</label>
                <item>The Federal Republic has not asked its allies for any atomic weapons. (But he
                  emphasized that he had not stated that the Federal Republic never would acquire
                  atomic weapons.)</item>
                <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0264"/>
                <label>3)</label>
                <item>According to his information, the United States has not yet achieved practical
                  results in the production of tactical atomic weapons. The interim period,
                  therefore, must be used to press for disarmament. Once tactical weapons become a
                  reality, however, Germany should re-examine the situation.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">British Military Leadership</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he was now confronted with the following very serious
              situation: He understood that UK ground forces were to be deployed in the future from
              Kassel to the North Sea, while US forces were to be confined to the area south of
              Kassel. He had also heard from his German military advisers that Britain’s military
              leaders, and particularly Montgomery, were adopting a strategy which was quite
              contrary to the US policy of forward defense. He was in general very much concerned
              with the trends in top British military leadership. His concern had been increased by
              a book published by two reputable French journalists with close connections in the
              French Ministry of Defense (<hi rend="italic">Les Secrets de l’Expedition
                d’Egypte,</hi> by Beuve-Merry and Bromberger). The Chancellor said that this book
              presents British leadership in a fearful light, and he recommended that the Secretary
              read it. The Chancellor said that all these things, together with British intentions
              to reduce forces in northern Germany, left him acutely worried about the security of
              the North German plain. The Russians, he said, have 7,200 tanks in the Soviet Zone,
              and might be tempted to push into this area if it should be stripped of its
              defenses.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor, therefore, wished to request that a certain number of United States
              combat units be attached to the German division stationed in Hannover. He felt that
              only in this way would there be sufficient security for northern Germany, since the
              presence of American troops would surely be a deterrent to the Soviets.</p>
            <p>The Secretary replied that the basis for these British steps was, as he had said on
              May 1, the historical change occurring in the status of Great Britain as a world
              power. The Secretary wished to make it clear, however, that he did not consider the UK
              as a factor to be written off as negligible. He said that, despite the Suez fiasco,
              the US military consider the British to be competent and dependable. Weaknesses in
              British military performance in the Suez affair had been due, at least in part, to an
              effort to preserve the secrecy of the undertaking at the outset. <persName
                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had been a sick man. The Secretary continued that
              he felt that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was a good, strong, and
              dependable person; and that one should not conclude, on the basis of Suez or of
              French-oriented or other journalistic reports, that the British forces were other than
              dependable and brave.</p>
            <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>
            <p>The Chancellor replied that the virtues of British troops should not be confused with
              the qualities of British military leadership. He was greatly concerned, the Chancellor
              continued, at Montgomery’s proposals for “defense in depth”, which had been expressed
              as a matter of moving Belgian troops back to Belgium, Dutch troops back to the
              Netherlands, etc. General Heusinger amplified this statement by describing the recent
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> exercise at which Montgomery had projected
              possible defense actions in a theoretical attack situation in 1965. Heusinger said
              that Montgomery had thoroughly supported the thesis expressed in the White Paper.
              Heusinger added that General Norstad had indeed stressed the theory of the “forward
              strategy”, but Heusinger had been surprised that Norstad had not countered
              Montgomery’s presentation in much more detail. The Secretary assured the Chancellor
              that such opinions expressed by Montgomery were not shared by the US Government, and
              said it was his impression that they were also not shared in many responsible quarters
              of the British Government. The Chancellor said that he hoped not, but added that the
              British have never done anything about Montgomery.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Defense Strategy</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary said he believed that the defense of Germany and Western Europe cannot
              be left entirely to the deterrent of massive atomic counter-attack. Depending on the
              situation, there would be powerful moral considerations against a massive retaliation
              on Moscow which would annihilate millions of people. There was a definite development,
              however, toward nuclear tactical weapons with far greater power than conventional
              tactical weapons. The time would arrive fairly soon, though it had not arrived yet,
              when forces equipped with such weapons, if stationed on a national border, might make
              virtually impossible invasion by hostile forces. Though this development was by no
              means yet complete, the Secretary believed that the trend was therefore away from
              defense by massive retaliation and toward defense by tactical atomic weapons.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Disarmament</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he doubted whether it would be possible to obtain an
              agreement on controlled disarmament which would abolish atomic weapons, since this new
              form of power was bound to be utilized in the field of armaments. He did believe,
              however, that it might be possible to reach agreement on control of the means of
              delivery of atomic explosives, i.e., on control of weapons of mass destruction in
              contrast to tactical atomic weapons. The Secretary felt that this was the most likely
              direction in which the London Disarmament Conference might achieve some kind of
              positive result on controls.</p>
            <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>
            <p>The Chancellor repeated his concern about the United Kingdom’s placing all reliance
              on massive retaliation. In the light of the British inclination to pull out of the
              North German plain even in the absence of an agreement on controlled disarmament, the
              Chancellor felt that there was a genuine chance of the Soviets’ moving into the plain
              if there were no US forces stationed there. General Heusinger gave a brief
              presentation on the strategic importance of the North German plain. <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> stated his conviction that neither Soviet nor
              satellite forces would attack this area if it involved the risk of tangling directly
              with United States forces, and said that the specific German request was that two US
              combat teams be relocated from south to north Germany.</p>
            <p>The Secretary stated that on these military matters he could not express an opinion,
              but assumed that the Germans would be discussing them with General Norstad.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soviet Embassy’s Note of May 4</hi></p>
            <p>During the course of the conversation, Ambassador Smirnov’s note of May 4 to the
              Chancellor was delivered. An interpreter was called in and he rendered a rough oral
              translation which was the basis for the provisional report of this note in Embassy
              telegram No. 4289 of May 4.<note n="5" xml:id="d105fn5">Not printed. (Department of
                State, Central Files, 661.62A/5–457) For text of this note, see <hi rend="italic"
                  >Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 254–255.</note> The Chancellor reacted in particular to the
              allegation in the note that he and Von Brentano had said the Federal Republic should
              possess atomic weapons if other Western powers acquired them. He retorted: “I never
              said that.”</p>
            <p>As soon as the note had been read, the Chancellor remarked that he was not sure
              whether the Federal Republic should proceed with commercial negotiations with the
              Soviet Union. If we should start them, he said, perhaps we shall see to it that they
              are dragged out. There would have to be some trade with the Soviet bloc, of course,
              but the Chancellor did not think that it should be allowed to grow too large. The
              Secretary concurred. The Chancellor said he would have to study Smirnov’s note
              further, but that he thought the Soviet note of April 27 was outrageous.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that, if the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister would allow him
              to do Von Brentano’s work for a moment, he could suggest the lines of a reply which he
              would make to the May 4 note if he were in the latter’s position. The Federal
              Republic, the Secretary suggested, might state that it has one great responsibility to
              itself and to humanity: to ensure that its territory is not used as a base for any
              aggression, this responsibility the Federal Republic will scrupulously discharge. As
              for the means of its own defense, however, <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0267"
              />the Federal Republic will not accept the dictates of any country; least of all of a
              country which forcibly holds some 20 million Germans in bondage. As for the reference
              to policy on disarmament, the Secretary concluded in his suggestion, this subject was
              being negotiated in conference at London and the Federal Republic will observe any
              agreement reached there.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Relations With Poland</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor asked the Secretary about the course to be set for relations with
              Poland. The Secretary replied that it was difficult to judge the degree of
              independence achieved by the Gomulka regime. The Secretary was inclined to believe
              that there had been some beginnings of Polish independence which deserved some
              encouragement—though this should not be overdone. Referring to the aid negotiations,
              the Secretary said that the United States may be disposed to extend a certain amount
              of economic aid, designed to encourage whatever additional degree of independence
              might be practicable in Poland and possibly in other satellite countries. This had not
              been an easy decision to reach, the United States Government was not entirely sure
              about the decision it was taking, but it did have a certain amount of confidence in
              the wisdom of its decision.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor replied that it might therefore appear appropriate for the Federal
              Republic cautiously to envisage the establishment of additional economic relations
              with Poland.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">European Unity and the Role of Great
              Britain</hi></p>
            <p>Von Brentano said that he had had a very useful conversation that morning with Pineau
              on ratification of the Rome Treaty<note n="6" xml:id="d105fn6">Reference is to the
                treaty ratified in Rome on March 21, 1957, creating <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                  >EURATOM</gloss> and a European Common Market.</note> and allied subjects, and on
              their common concern about the United Kingdom’s position. The UK, Von Brentano said,
              had been exerting an unfortunate pressure on France in two respects: (1) The British
              had been urging the French to reach agreement on the Free Trade Area prior to
              ratification of the treaty on the Common Market. Von Brentano had agreed with Pineau
              that this would be impossible—negotiation of the Common Market treaty had taken some
              18 months, and it was obvious that negotiations on the Free Trade Area would also last
              for months. This British intervention, therefore, could have only a very unfortunate
              psychological effect on the French with respect to prospects for ratification of the
              Common Market treaty. (2) Von Brentano also considered British advocacy of the
              so-called “Grand Design” as unfortunate. He felt that this was not a good scheme, and
              that it could only have the effect of destroying prospects for practicable <pb n="240"
                xml:id="pg_240" facs="0268"/>projects toward European unity. Von Brentano said that
              Pineau had fully agreed with him on this point. Von Brentano explained that one of the
              most questionable aspects of the “Grand Design” was that it was proposed as including
              all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries in its membership. He said
              that he did not know whether the United States and Canada would be willing to join the
              proposed single great assembly, whereupon the Chancellor interjected: “We would not
              join it.”</p>
            <p>The Secretary replied that the United States Government shares some of this concern
              regarding the British moves. The Secretary had just seen Foreign Minister <persName
                corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, who had firmly denied that there was any British
              governmental opposition to the treaties on the Common Market and <gloss
                target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and had asserted that these treaties had the
              strong support of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and Thorneycroft.
                <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, however, had suggested reasons why
              there should be some connection between the Common Market and the Free Trade Area (Von
              Brentano interjected: “We agree”). The Secretary said that he agreed that there are
              some tendencies to endanger the prospects for practical European projects by
              superimposing rather vague, more generalized plans. The United States Government, he
              assured the Chancellor, would not participate in such maneuvers, and specifically had
              no intention of joining the “Grand Design”.</p>
            <p>Von Brentano confirmed that he and Pineau had agreed not to accept the British
              proposal regarding the Free Trade Area. Their position would be that the Common Market
              treaty should be ratified first and as soon as possible, and that negotiations on the
              Free Trade Area should then proceed.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that the United States Government strongly supported the Common
              Market, and did not wish any position on its own part to interfere with the prospects
              for ratification of this treaty. If the Common Market treaty should not be ratified
              soon, he said, there would be great discouragement in the United States about European
              unity. As long as Western Europe remains divided, the Secretary said, it appears to
              the American public either as subject to being captured by the Russians or as
              representing some kind of charge on the US which the American public is not prepared
              to carry indefinitely. A united Europe, by contrast, could be as powerful as the
              United States or the Soviet Union. Complete sovereignty for the many nations of
              Europe, said the Secretary, is a luxury which European countries can no longer afford
              at US expense. If the Common Market treaty should fail, after the failure of the
                <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, the Secretary thought that further support for
              Europe could hardly be expected from American public opinion.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that the German process of ratification should be completed at
              the end of June. Von Brentano mentioned <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0269"/>that
              the French Government also hoped to meet this deadline, but he had heard that the
              British Ambassador in Paris, Sir Gladwyn Jebb, had been making representations toward
              delaying the French schedule on ratification. The Secretary suggested that the
              Chancellor discuss this matter with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
              during the latter’s forthcoming visit.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Support Costs</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary said he hoped that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                >Eisenhower</persName>’s most recent proposal on support costs<note n="7"
                xml:id="d105fn7">See <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>.</note> would be found
              acceptable by the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>Von Brentano replied that the Federal Government would, of course, like to reach
              agreement as soon as possible, but the difficulty was that parliamentary approval was
              required for each separate agreement on support costs. If the US-German agreement
              should contain a reservation, the Bundestag would undoubtedly object on the grounds
              that other countries would demand similar consideration. Hence there could be no
              certainty about keeping the Federal Government’s total contribution down to the
              definite sum envisaged by the Bundestag. Under the present budgetary situation, the
              Bundestag could hardly be expected to grant more than last year’s total contribution.
              The Federal Government had indeed made a generous offer to the British, Von Brentano
              said, and this had been partly because the Secretary had encouraged it to do so.</p>
            <p>The Secretary replied that he hoped the Germans realized that the United States
              Government was also faced with parliamentary difficulties in this matter. The Congress
              had become excited about the support costs issue, and this was admittedly to a certain
              degree attributable to certain Defense officials who were anxious to free funds for
              other projects. The point in the President’s proposal, the Secretary said, was that
              the residual problem for this year could be dealt with after the parliamentary
              recesses on both sides and after the German elections. The United States Government
              could emphasize to the Congress the reservation in the proposed agreement; while the
              Federal Government would be in a position to assure the Bundestag that it was
              committed to make no further payment without the agreement of the Bundestag.</p>
            <p>Von Brentano asked if it would not be possible for both sides to agree on the figure
              offered by the Germans, since a formula could undoubtedly be found which would not
              exclude later discussions. The Secretary said that he believed there was agreement on
              this point, but Hallstein pointed out that there was still one difficulty in the US
              proposal: namely, that the first payment was characterized as “on account”. This
              implied that a later payment must be made, Hallstein <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242"
                facs="0270"/>said, and the implication would undoubtedly be unacceptable to the
              Bundestag. The Secretary said that it had not been our intention now to obtain an
              implied obligation to make a further payment, but simply to find a formula on later
              discussions which would be acceptable to both parliaments.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Stinnes Properties</hi></p>
            <p>Von Brentano said that he had heard from Washington of the US decision to proceed
              with sales of the vested Stinnes properties, and wished to make again an urgent plea
              that such sales be delayed until after the German elections. The Chancellor added that
              it should not be forgotten that Stinnes had numerous socialist connections.</p>
            <p>The Secretary asked if it would not be possible to solve this problem by organizing a
              group of German interests who would purchase the properties to be sold. Hallstein
              replied that such a group had indeed already been organized, but Krekeler explained
              that it was not clear to what extent such a group would be legally in a position to
              purchase. Less than 50 per cent of the securities were apparently legally unencumbered
              for such sale. Krekeler expressed the view that a delay of some months in disposition
              of the properties, affording time to negotiate, would provide desirable clarifications
              for both sides. The Secretary said that both the President and he had discussed this
              matter with the Attorney General. There were many complex regulations affecting this
              sale under legislation administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
              make delay costly. The Secretary felt confident, however, that a solution to the
              question would be found through purchase by a German group. He pointed out that, for
              the first time, exceptions to previous practice were now possible so as to permit
              purchase of vested German properties by German interests.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Status of Forces Negotiations</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary stated briefly to Von Brentano (as the meeting adjourned to the
              luncheon table) the US position favoring a continuation of the negotiations.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effects of Atomic Radiation</hi></p>
            <p>Particularly in the light of the forthcoming Bundestag debate on the subject, the
              Chancellor told the Secretary that it would be most helpful to the Federal Government
              to obtain from the United States as much factual material as possible which would
              demonstrate the limits to the effects of nuclear radiation on human beings.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I dictate this en route from Bonn to
              Paris. I have just had a most interesting session of over three hours with the
              Chancellor. Also present on his side were Foreign Minister Von Brentano, Defense
              Minister <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> and General Heusinger. A full
              memorandum of our talk is being prepared<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2"><ref
                  target="#d105"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> and will I think be
              worth your reading particularly in anticipation of the Chancellor’s visit to you.</p>
            <p>The high spot was the Chancellor’s deep concern over UK developments. The combination
              of their white paper policies and their collapse in the Middle East, including what he
              considers their bad military performance in Suez, make him deeply depressed. He feels
              that they cannot be relied upon to fight in Western Germany and therefore pleads for
              some US troops to be moved north to stiffen the northern front and to make the
              Russians realize that if they attacked they would have to fight US and not merely
              UK.</p>
            <p>I endeavored to reassure him that while we felt that inevitable adjustments were
              occurring in British policy and military dispositions, we still felt that Britain was
              a strong and dependable ally.</p>
            <p>Obviously <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> will have quite a job to do
              when he speaks with the Chancellor on Monday.</p>
            <p>While we were talking, a new Soviet note was delivered<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3"
                >See <ref target="#d105fn5">footnote 5, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>
              It was read to the Chancellor and myself. In essence it referred to a prior Federal
              Republic statement that it did not have, and had not asked for, atomic weapons. The
              Soviet note said this was unsatisfactory unless it meant that the Federal Republic
              would not ask for, and would not permit, atomic weapons on its soil.</p>
            <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0272"/>
            <p>I suggested that the Chancellor should reply in effect that the Federal Republic had
              one supreme obligation which it would fulfill, that was never to allow its soil to be
              used for aggressive purposes; but that it did not accept dictation from anyone as to
              how to defend itself, least of all from a nation which had forcibly annexed the
              eastern zone and 20 million Germans.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor seemed to like this and it was suggested that Von Brentano should pay
              me a per diem for having done his work.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor is indeed perplexed about how to handle during the election period the
              atomic problem. The issue is being exploited by the Socialists, and the scientists and
              the churchmen, particularly Evangelical, are making life difficult for him.</p>
            <p>I suggested that would be a good idea if we could have stationed at our Embassy for
              the next few weeks someone knowledgeable in these matters who could help meet the
              emotional appeals which are becoming the battle cry of his political opposition. The
              government officials themselves are too ignorant of these matters to know what to
              say.</p>
            <p>This idea was warmly welcomed by the Chancellor; and if you think it has
              possibilities you might want to speak to <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Lewis
                Strauss</persName> about it. Of course it would have to be handled with great care,
              but I think Bruce can be relied upon to do so. The Chancellor also said the atomic
              expert should preferably be able to speak German.</p>
            <p>Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> gave the most
              categorical assurances regarding the West German military build-up. He said they were
              planning to have nine divisions in being by the end of 1958 and would begin on the
              last three in 1959, provided the US is in a position to supply the armor for the
              armored divisions to meet this time schedule. He also said that the alleged delay in
              their armored divisions was not due to their asking for later deliveries of tanks as
              had been reported, but due to the fact that they could not get any early delivery date
              from our people.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor sent his warmest greetings to you and said he eagerly looked forward
              to seeing you.</p>
            <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                According to the source text, the conversation took place in the evening at

            <p>In conversation with the German Ambassador I said that I felt that the conversations
              about the Stinnes Company which we had at Bonn on Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2"
                >See <ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>.</note> had not left the position very
              clear because this item only came up as we were moving from the drawing room to the
              lunch room. I said that I had since discussed the matter with the Attorney General and
              that he had not felt that it was practical to postpone the sale for a matter of months
              because of the SEC registration conditions, but that I did feel that the Germans
              should take advantage of the unique opportunity now offered them to buy in the
              property themselves. The Ambassador said that there was some problem of money because
              of the necessity of taking care of some American interests.</p>
            <p>I said that I thought that this financing could no doubt be arranged through New York
              investment banks. I mentioned that a tentative approach on this subject had been made
              to Lazards. The Ambassador said that he would advise his Government that they should
              send over to New York promptly someone with authority to organize a purchase group. I
              said I thought this was the best way to proceed.</p>

            <p>4443. Eyes only for Secretary. In view nature <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName>’s visit and improbability his being able draw any domestic
              political advantage from substantive results, I recommend for your consideration
              something relatively dramatic with respect to arrangements for visit. Although I
              recognize it would be burdensome and perhaps impracticable <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246"
                facs="0274"/>for the President and that there may be other disadvantages from
              Washington point of view, I suggest that an invitation from the President to <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to visit him at his farm at Gettysburg would be
              very helpful to Chancellor’s reelection and subsequent relationships with him. This
              might be confined to lunch on Sunday, a short walk around the farm, and his return
              with you to Washington where he could spend quiet night German Embassy.</p>
            <p>Such an idea has never been hinted at by Chancellor or any of his entourage, but if
              an invitation were extended, reaction would undoubtedly be one of mingled surprise and
              joy.</p>
            <p>I make this suggestion reluctantly but feel something unusual is desirable for
              following reasons: there is every sign the election will be close. Chancellor is well
              aware of this and, in fact, thinks of little else. He is ardently seeking political
              help and, in this unique German situation, particularly relies on U.S.</p>
            <p>You will recall how paramount this was in his thoughts the first day you saw him in
              Bonn when he even suggested that <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold Stassen</persName>
              keep the Disarmament Subcommittee discussions going until September 15. You will also
              recall he had no specific suggestions to make when you asked him what he would
              consider helpful in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué. Unfortunately,
              he and his cohorts are still unable to think of anything that would assist him in a
              political way which might be incorporated in the communiqué at the end of his
              Washington visit.</p>
            <p>The kind of thing which would be helpful—for example, a new and dramatic
              reunification plan, seems presently unlikely. Your comments at press conference May

              forces omitted. Status of forces problem, however, included among several on which
              Foreign Office preparing contingency papers. Additional topics in this category are:
              support costs, war criminals, and (only if raised by US) extent and implications of

            <p>Principal objective of trip is demonstration here of Chancellor’s influence and
              solidarity with US and therefore we believe discussion of following points should be
              conducted with view to how final communiqué can serve this purpose.</p>
            <p>Two stormiest issues for Chancellor in election campaign are atomic questions and
              relation of disarmament to German reunification. Opposition continues to press
              argument that US no longer insists that progress on disarmament be contingent on
              corresponding progress on reunification and possibility that US and USSR will make
              agreement over Germany’s head. While government satisfied with Secretary’s statement
              to press May 14<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref target="#d108fn2">footnote 2, <hi
                    rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> it would be useful to restate jointly
              points made in Secretary’s press conference in addition to usual statements on
              continuing closest collaboration and consultation on disarmament and reunification.
              This might include statement Chancellor had won further assurances that US would not
              initiate any agreement on disarmament which would adversely affect German
              reunification. It might also give some support to government in problem making clear
              to public that any progress on disarmament is bound to create atmosphere more
              favorable for reunification. There is greatest confusion at all levels here on
              distinction between inspection, thinning out, neutralization and disarmament.
              Sensational press and opposition leaders are doing their best to discredit Secretary’s
              press conference by implying divergence of view between him and <persName
                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>. Anything designed to counteract this would be
              desirable. <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0276"/>Defense Minister <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> has said he is recommending to Chancellor that
              communiqué include statement to effect that in Washington conversations it was made
              clear that American defense policy and plans are based on assumption that Federal
              Republic will make its appropriate contribution to Western defense and that US has no
              present intention of reducing its forces in Europe. He explicitly said he intends use
              this to meet opposition arguments that US must defend Germany under all circumstances
              in its own interests and it would be prudent to bear in mind that if Chancellor
              proposes this for communiqué, his party may use it to threaten reconsideration of US
              policy if <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> elected. As Department aware, <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> has demanded government renounce atomic weapons and
              refuse stationing US atomic weapons or atomic forces in Federal Republic. In this
              connection, statement to effect US will not station its troops anywhere without most
              effective means to defend themselves would serve similar purpose but would involve
              same possibility of exploitation.</p>
            <p>Krone has privately raised with us possibility of Chancellor’s suggesting a
              moratorium on atomic tests, to be in some way tied in with his visit. While this
              suggestion does not seem realistic we are reporting it for what it may be worth.</p>
            <p>Chancellor also has made considerable point of close consultation with us on latest
              techniques and plans for civil defense. Minister Interior Schroeder today informed
              Embassy Chancellor plans to mention this in Washington and shortly after his visit
              Schroeder will travel to US for about ten days study trip. Communiqué might state that
              close cooperation in field of civil defense will continue and will find expression in
              early visit by German Minister of Interior to undertake detailed studies with Federal
              Civil Defense Administration, American Red Cross, and other US agencies concerned.</p>
            <p>Chancellor may wish communiqué to indicate he raised vested assets question and
              received assurances US Government doing utmost. We doubt he really wants any long
              discussion or expects US concessions on this point.</p>
            <p>Re “status reunification problems,” working group is in public eye here and it will
              be expected Washington communiqué at least express gratification at progress and
              harmony and determination continue closest collaboration on this problem recognized as
              of vital interest to both countries and cause world peace.</p>
            <p>European integration remains one of Chancellor’s major policy planks and recognition
              his contribution this field would be psychological boost. To add much to Chancellor’s
              internal strength, however, statement would have to stress importance of Germany’s
              contribution and role in these new activities.</p>
            <p>Re buildup, believe highly desirable that <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> be made aware our position, as reflected in position paper for

            </list>
            <p>While the Chancellor desires to use his visit to Washington in order to demonstrate
              his close relationship with the United States Government for the purposes of his
              election campaign, he has for some time been anxious to come here for a discussion of
              major policy issues. He will hope that the communiqué will reflect a close association
              of German and American policies and will give him substantial satisfaction on the
              major points he intends to discuss with you and the President.</p>
            <p>Although he suffered some losses last year, the Chancellor’s political fortunes rose
              after the Hungarian crisis. The events in Hungary were cited by the Chancellor and his
              adherents as proof of the correctness of their foreign policy. However, the recent
              debate regarding atomic weapons in Germany, in which the Chancellor finds his position
              in opposition to the prevailing emotional moods of the German <pb n="250"
                xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>population, has undoubtedly caused him considerable
              concern. Recent press reports of changes in American policy regarding Europe in
              connection with the disarmament negotiations again revived fears of an American deal
              with the Soviet Union at German expense and are also being used to attack the German
              Government.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Disarmament, German Reunification and European
                Security.</hi></p>
            <p>While the Chancellor and his adherents have expressed gratification regarding our
              recent official statements clarifying the true United States position on rumors
              regarding a neutralized or demilitarized zone in central Europe, speculation on these
              subjects continues to run high in the German press. There still appears to be concern
              in the German government as well that they have no firm and clear assurance that an
              agreement will not be made on disarmament which will result in a relaxation of tension
              on the basis of the status quo. The Chancellor will undoubtedly seek to obtain, both
              in the communiqué and in the proposed Four Power declaration on German reunification,
              statements not only that nothing will be done to prejudice the reunification of
              Germany but that in fact the Western powers, and in particular, the United States,
              will insist upon German reunification as a condition to a comprehensive agreement on
              disarmament. The Chancellor will admit that initial steps, particularly in the field
              of inspection, can be taken without bringing in the question of German reunification.
              While he would like to obtain as tight a link as possible between disarmament and
              reunification, he may confine himself to seeking assurance that progress should be
              made on the two subjects pari passu.</p>
            <p>I think that it is important that we speak with the Chancellor as frankly as we can
              about our general approach to the disarmament problem and tell him as much as we can
              regarding what may come into the public domain in the coming months, if we are to
              avoid the type of problem which arose at the time of the press reports regarding the
              so-called “<persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> Plan”. The publication of
              press reports regarding this alleged plan soon after the Chancellor had visited
              Washington last year gave rise to charges in Germany that the Chancellor did not enjoy
              the confidence of the United States Government and deeply affected the Chancellor
              himself.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor may refer to the confusion which has occurred in public discussion
              regarding various concepts of inspection zones, zones of limitation, demilitarized
              zones, neutralized zones, etc., as well as the confusion which has arisen over various
                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> plans. As to the former, he may well
              propose to you that some steps be taken to clarify in the public mind the distinction
              between zones for inspection purposes which are being discussed in the context of the
              disarmament discussions, and zones of force limitations, which have <pb n="251"
                xml:id="pg_251" facs="0279"/>been discussed in the context of European security As
              to the various <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> plans, the British have
              made clear that the only <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> plan which has
              any current validity is the plan for reunification with free elections in
                Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">For text of the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"

            <p>The Chancellor will no doubt endorse the idea of the early issuance of a Four Power
              declaration on German reunification<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">A draft of this
                declaration is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 62 D 181, CF

              helpful if agreement could be reached between us and the Germans during the course of
              the Chancellor’s visit on the proposed text of the declaration so that we could
              jointly seek British and French agreement on a final text. It would also be well to
              agree on a time of release. The Germans hope for an early release and would like to
              have the declaration issued at Berlin in order that it might become known as “The
              Declaration of Berlin”. A paper on this subject is attached. (Tab C)<note n="5"
                xml:id="d110fn5">No tabs were found attached to the source text.</note></p>
            <p>The Germans have received intelligence reports, to which they give considerable
              credence, that the Soviets will soon take a new initiative in this field, aimed at
              separating Germany from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and preventing the
              Federal Republic from acquiring atomic weapons. The Chancellor will undoubtedly wish
              assurance that we will continue to work closely with the Federal Republic in
              countering Soviet moves. In responding, you may wish to thank the Chancellor for the
              manner in which his Government has kept us informed and consulted with us and in
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in connection with its exchanges with the
              Soviet Government.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will also wish to raise, perhaps in his conversation with you and the
              President, the question of a Four Power conference with the Soviets. His purpose may
              be to ensure that, if progress is being made in the field of disarmament, the
              unification issue will be pressed simultaneously. You may wish to remind the
              Chancellor that the Soviets proposed in February that a meeting of the Disarmament
              Committee should be attended by Foreign Ministers. At that time we thought it
              possible, although unlikely, that the Soviets might wish to have the meeting as a
              screen to bring the Foreign Ministers together. We solicited the German views, which
              were not in favor of having a meeting at the Ministers’ level. While pointing <pb
                n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"/>out the dangers of a meeting with the Soviets
              in the absence of any indication that it would be fruitful, you may wish to leave the
              matter somewhat open in the light of developments in the London disarmament talks.
              There is a danger that if we leave the matter open, the Germans may let this be
              publicly known and create the impression of a more favorable United States attitude
              than is the case.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Military
                Problems.</hi></p>
            <p>The main problem under this heading which the Chancellor will undoubtedly wish to
              discuss is the relation between nuclear and conventional capabilities and he may
              express his continuing concern over the drift which he sees toward a situation in
              which the Western Powers will have only the capability to conduct nuclear warfare.</p>
            <p>While the Chancellor has exhibited a deep interest in these subjects, it is not
              wholly clear to us that he is fully familiar with the relevant <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial decisions. It might be well if you could
              go over the main points in <gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>–48 and the Political
                Directive,<note n="6" xml:id="d110fn6">For documentation on <gloss target="#t_MC1"
                  >MC</gloss>–48 and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Political Directive,
                see <ref target="frus1955-57v04#pg_1">vol. IV, pp.1</ref> ff.</note> stressing both
              (a) the need for the progressive development of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> atomic capability in the shield forces and (b) the fact that such
              adequate shield forces should also be able to deal with incidents such as
              infiltrations, incursions and local hostile actions without necessarily using nuclear
              weapons.</p>
            <p>You may wish to point out to him that the question of the exact relationship between
              capabilities needed in conventional and nuclear fields must be based on advice from
              the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military authorities. A study of what is
              needed is being made by General Norstad at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s
              request, pursuant to the Political Directive and the resolution of the <gloss
                target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> Council last March which the Germans sponsored. We have
              the utmost confidence in General Norstad’s judgment and we are certain that the
              studies which he is making will permit governments to focus on this problem
              effectively in the fall.</p>
            <p>Recent public opinion polls suggest a very high degree of public resistance in
              Germany at the present time, not only to the German possession of atomic weapons, but
              to the possession of these weapons by forces stationed in Germany. This sentiment is
              being exploited by the Socialist Party. You may wish to express appreciation of the
              difficulties confronting the Chancellor, while pointing out to him that the Soviet
              campaign of intimidation is designed to divide the Western Allies and to prevent us
              from defending ourselves effectively.</p>
            <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>
            <p>You may also wish to lay a basis in discussions under this heading for a discussion
              on the German military build-up by pointing out that there are substantial shield
              forces on the European central front but that they are largely from non-continental
              countries and that they must be supplemented by the full German contribution if <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategic plans are to be capable of
              implementation.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will wish to be reassured regarding the maintenance of U.S. Forces on
              the Continent. He also continues to fear that the United States would hesitate to
              engage in all out war with the Soviet Union in the event of an attack on Europe. His
              concern on this point stems in part from his misinterpretation of a talk which he had
              with Secretary Quarles last year.<note n="7" xml:id="d110fn7">See <ref target="#d72"
                  >Document 72</ref>.</note> It would be helpful if both you and the President could
              reassure him on these points.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor may again raise the suggestion he made to you in Bonn May 4<note n="8"
                xml:id="d110fn8">See <ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>.</note> that the U.S.
              Forces be moved to the British defense sector in the North German plain. If he does,
              you might point out there continue to be substantial effective British forces in the
              area, at the same time noting that this is in the first instance a deployment question
              within <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s responsibility.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. German Military Build-up.</hi></p>
            <p>It is not entirely clear to us that the Chancellor is aware of the degree to which
              the German defense effort is lagging and the extent to which current German planning
              falls below what we have for some time been led to expect the Germans would do. It
              would be well if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> of the Defense
              Department could speak on this point. The present German Defense Minister has, in
              effect, disavowed the plans of his predecessor for a rapid build-up to a force of
              500,000 men. The German Government has not submitted new plans to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, we have reason to believe that they are
              operating on a plan which would produce a total of 343,000 men by 1961, of which
              200,000 would be ground forces. While this would produce twelve divisions, some of
              them would be under-strength and they would be inadequately supported.</p>
            <p>The fault lies partly in the unwillingness of the German Government to devote more
              money to the build-up, partly to indecision regarding military planning, partly to
              faulty administration. We do not expect the German Government to undertake new
              commitments or to make announcements prior to the elections. However, by the fall,
              when the elections are past, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s requirements
              based on the Political Directive will have been established. We think we should expect
              the Germans to come into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the 1957 Annual
              Review <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0282"/>with a statement at least in general
              terms of what they plan to do to meet these force requirements and within what time
              period.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. European Integration.</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor’s primary concern under this heading will be the effect of the recent
              change in the Italian Government and the French political crisis on the prospects for
              ratification of the Common Market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>
              treaties. He will be anxious to obtain your analysis of the political prospects in
              these two countries. A paper on this subject is attached. (Tab G) He may perhaps also
              raise the question of some American pressure to bring about the ratification of the
              treaties.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">6. German Relations with the Soviet Union and the
                Satellites, Particularly Poland.</hi></p>
            <p>The Chancellor may give you an indication of the plans of the Federal Government for
              the conduct of its negotiations with the Soviet Union on trade matters and on the
              repatriation of Germans from the U.S.S.R. If he does not volunteer a statement on this
              subject, it would be useful if you could ask for one.</p>
            <p>On the subject of Poland, he may wish your appraisal of most recent developments and
              a statement of the outcome of our aid discussions. It appears to us that Gomulka has
              successfully maintained his position and there is every indication that his regime
              will continue with the foreign policy and domestic programs initiated last fall. A
              paper on Poland is attached. (Tab K)</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will probably indicate a German desire to intensify trade relations
              with Poland as a preliminary to development of relations in the political field. It
              would be useful if you could say that, although the Poles did not wish to bring the
              matter into their recent negotiations with us, we for our part would be disposed to
              examine some triangular arrangements, once the United States-Polish bilateral
              agreement has been finally concluded.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">7. German Assets in the United States; Stinnes
                Case.</hi></p>
            <p>The German Ambassador has outlined to us the proposals which he sketched out to you
              in his talk on May 20.<note n="9" xml:id="d110fn9">A copy of the Secretary’s
                memorandum of conversation with Krekeler is in Department of State, Secretary’s

              paper. (Tab L) The proposals would involve a substantial outlay of United States
              Government funds (at least $100 million). The Germans feel that, if the United States
              Government were willing to put up $100 million, representing the amount of German
              assets used to pay claims against Japan, as was proposed by the Administration in
              1955, a satisfactory compromise could be reached. <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255"
                facs="0283"/>The Germans think this would permit substantial satisfaction of U.S.
              claims against Germany and a 70% return to former German owners.</p>
            <p>The significant fact in the German approach is the desire to seek some compromise. On
              the other hand, the Germans are unwilling to put forward a proposal themselves and
              apparently expect that we will do something during the course of the discussions. It
              would appear undesirable to reject the German suggestion out of hand. It is suggested
              that you indicate that the difficulties in the way of doing anything more than has
              been proposed by the Administration are very serious and that we cannot do more than
              study the suggestions.</p>
            <p>The Germans have made a new approach to us on the Stinnes case, requesting an
              extension of 30 to 60 days in order to permit them to organize a consortium to bid for
              the property. This matter has been raised with the Department of Justice and will have
              to be dealt with on the basis of the situation when the talks occur.</p>
            <p>The Germans will undoubtedly press very hard for some reference to these subjects in
              the communiqué.</p>

            <p>Discussions with a view to reaching an agreement on the basis of your conversation
              with Von Brentano still are going on in Bonn. The Germans have given us drafts which
              we do not think adequately reflect the agreement reached with Von Brentano. The
              financial position of military forces is becoming increasingly acute and we are
              informed by Defense that some funds must be made available by June 1. Meanwhile, the

            <p>Before your meeting with the Chancellor on Tuesday<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">May
                28.</note> morning, I will have two talks with him on Monday. We plan to discuss
              disarmament, German reunification, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
              problems, the status of the German military build-up, European integration, and
              relations with the Soviet bloc. The Chancellor will also raise the question of German
              assets in the United States. We plan to raise with him the question of financial
              support for United States forces in Germany if a settlement has not been reached by
              that time.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will have two principal problems on his mind. One is the implications
              of the increased development of nuclear weapons. The other is the question of
              disarmament and its relation to German reunification.</p>
            <p>As you know, the Chancellor is deeply troubled from a moral viewpoint about the
              implications of nuclear warfare. In addition, nuclear weapons have become a major
              campaign issue in Germany which is causing him serious difficulty. The Chancellor has
              taken the position that the German Federal Government is not seeking atomic weapons,
              but he has refused to foreclose the possibility of eventual German possession of
              tactical nuclear weapons if an agreement on disarmament is not reached in the next
              several years. He has also defended the stationing of United States units with atomic
              capability in Germany. His position is being sharply attacked by his Socialist
              opposition. You may wish to mention your appreciation of the courageous stand which he
              has taken.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Chancellor is very much concerned that Western defense efforts
              are being too exclusively centered on nuclear capability, particularly in the British
              case. He fears that we will drift into a position in which we will be unable to deal
              with any difficulty except by resort to nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will wish to be reassured regarding two points of American policy. One
              is the maintenance of United States forces on the continent. The other is our
              determination to respond to a Soviet attack on Europe, concerning which he has
              lingering doubts.</p>
            <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0285"/>
            <p>It would be useful if you could discuss with him the role of nuclear weapons and
              assure him that we believe that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> shield
              forces, which must be ready to use nuclear weapons in all-out war, should be
              sufficient to also be able to handle limited hostilities without necessarily using
              nuclear weapons. It will also be desirable that you assure him of our firm
              determination (a) to fulfill our obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, reacting
              instantly to a Soviet attack, and (b) to contribute on a fair share basis to the
              defense of Europe.</p>
            <p>In this connection, it would be useful if you could emphasize to him the importance
              of an effective contribution by Germany to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              defense in Europe. You might say that, while we appreciate the political difficulties
              which confront him, we have a feeling that the Germans have not set their sights high
              enough in the terms of the effort which they are making. Once the election is out of
              the way, we look forward to a real effort on their part to move forward rapidly with
              the creation of the forces which we have been expecting for some time they would
              contribute to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. You may wish to stress the
              importance to the alliance of every nation contributing its fair share to the defense
              effort.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor is most anxious that we should continue our negotiations with the
              Soviets in an effort to reach an agreement on disarmament. At the same time, he is
              concerned, as are the German people, that an agreement of substantial scope on
              disarmament might be reached without having come to an agreement with the Soviets on
              German reunification.</p>
            <p>I will have gone over the disarmament problem with him in some detail. It would be
              most helpful if you could do so as well and review the main aspects of the problem
              with him. I recommend that you also assure him that we will do nothing in the
              disarmament field which would prejudice the reunification of Germany. On the other
              hand, it would be well if you could emphasize the importance of our continuing to
              explore the possibilities of a disarmament arrangement with the Soviets in a flexible
              way.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor may raise with you the possibility of a new Four-Power conference with
              the Soviets later in the year.<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3"><p>On May 25 at 5:05 p.m.,
                    <persName>Dulles</persName> telephoned the President. The transcript of the
                  conversation reads:</p>
                <p>“The Sec. reported the word from the German Embassy re the proposal to have a
                  four-power conference on German reunification. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                    >Adenauer</persName> wanted the Secretary’s views. The Secretary said he would
                  be very dubious about the propriety of our joining with the Germans to make such a
                  statement. The British and the French would be upset. The Sec. said that if
                    <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> does bring it up with the Pres.
                  he would suggest that the Pres. be a little reserved about it. The Sec. says in
                  this matter we should not tread on the toes of other countries. We do have joint
                  responsibility with the British and French on German reunification. The Sec. said
                  that if the paper from the Germans appeared significant he would call him at
                  Gettysburg tomorrow morning.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers)</p></note> What
              he <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>may have in mind is pressing the issue of
              German reunification simultaneously with the disarmament discussions in order to keep
              at least a loose link between the two and to take advantage of any flexibility in the
              Soviet position. You may wish to point out the dangers involved in a new meeting
              unless there is real grounds for believing we could make progress. You might suggest
              that it would be premature to consider the matter until we can gain a clearer idea of
              Soviet intentions from the London discussions. In the light of the development of the
              talks with the Chancellor, you may wish to express a willingness to review the
              question later in the year.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will also probably raise with you the question of German assets in the
              United States and perhaps the forthcoming sale by the Alien Property Custodian of the
              predominant German share in the Stinnes Company, an American holding company with
              properties located in Germany. If he does, it would be desirable to bring the Attorney
              General into the discussions.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor will hope that the final communiqué will be of assistance to him in
              Germany from an election viewpoint. We will have to devote a part of the meeting on
              Tuesday to a discussion of the communiqué.</p>

            <p>After the Secretary had welcomed the Chancellor to Washington, he asked whether the
              proposed agenda was satisfactory.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Regarding the agenda for
                the meetings, see <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> The Chancellor said
              it was. The Secretary suggested that the first item on the agenda, disarmament, be
              discussed in a restricted meeting. It was agreed to hold such a meeting in the
                afternoon.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">See <ref target="#d116">Document
                116</ref>.</note></p>
            <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>
            <p>The Secretary then turned to the second item on the agenda, the draft Four-Power
              declaration and annex prepared by the Four-Power Working Group on Reunification.<note
                n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">Copies of the draft declaration and the annex are in
                Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 62 D 181, CF 888.</note> The Secretary
              said we considered the draft documents prepared by the Four-Power Working Group to be
              generally acceptable. He had only two comments: <list>
                <label>(1)</label>
                <item>With regard to the disagreed language of Section IV dealing with the status of
                  the East Zone of Germany after reunification, we thought that something less
                  specific would be preferable. We therefore proposed the following wording in this
                  section: “We would not seek to gain any military advantage as a result of the
                  withdrawal of Soviet forces.” The Secretary explained that we were reluctant to
                  make a firm commitment that no forces would ever be advanced into East Germany
                  because of our fear that this might create a vacuum of power. At the same time, if
                  German forces even of a limited character were established there under <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> control this could be considered a violation of
                  our commitment under the terms of the language proposed by the UK-French-German
                  members of the Group. We would, therefore, prefer some language more limited in
                  character, as he had suggested earlier. The Chancellor indicated his
                  agreement.</item>
                <label>(2)</label>
                <item>With reference to the disagreed passage in Section III of the declaration on
                  the relationship between disarmament and German reunification, the Secretary said
                  we would prefer the following language: “The Four Powers wish to make clear that
                  they do not intend taking any steps in the disarmament field which would prejudice
                  German reunification.” The Secretary said that the point was that while we do not
                  intend to take any steps which would prejudice German reunification, it was quite
                  another thing to say that we would not take steps which would have a particular
                  effect. It was not always possible to tell what the effect on this issue might be
                  of our actions in other parts of the world, such as Japan or Poland. This could
                  well depend on whether the Soviets might claim that these actions were in fact
                  prejudicial to German reunification. We did not wish to give the Soviets complete
                  control over our policies and actions in other parts of the world. It was always
                  difficult to say we would not do anything which would have a particular effect,
                  since this involved the question of Soviet mentality and we are not always clear
                  what is in their minds.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he was doubtful that the Soviets would in fact claim that
              what the United States or the other three Western Powers might be doing in other areas
              would prejudice the reunification of Germany. In any event he would appreciate being
              furnished with our suggestions for the specific wording of this paragraph in order
              that he might study the matter. He would be able to discuss it further tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then commented that there appeared to be certain duplications in the
              Annex of material already covered in the main <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0289"
              />document prepared by the Working Group, which he felt tended to weaken the total
              effect of the two papers. In addition, he felt that the reference to the Geneva Summit
                Directive<note n="5" xml:id="d113fn5">For text, see <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v05#pg_527">vol. V, pp. 527</ref>–<ref
                  target="frus1955-57v05#pg_528">528</ref>.</note> regarding the reunification of
              Germany by free elections deserved a place in the main document rather than the
              Annex.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said he wished to explain the idea of the Annex. The German thinking
              had been that the Annex should be in condensed form (in order to take into account the
              laziness of the average reader) to summarize the principal ideas spelled out in more
              detail in the main document. The Secretary said he was prepared to yield to the
              Chancellor in his estimate as to how much the German people were willing to read, and
              if the Chancellor considered the documents to be in the best form we would not argue
              to the contrary. The Chancellor said that if the Secretary had any doubts on the
              matter and thought the documents could be compressed, he believed this question should
              be referred to the Four-Power Working Group for study. The Secretary indicated his
              agreement.</p>

            <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>
            <p>The Chancellor said he would like first to say something about his conference with
              General Norstad shortly before leaving Bonn for the United States. Norstad had given
              him a comprehensive survey of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> situation and

            <p>The Chancellor said he also wished to refer to the recent resolution of the Bundestag
              on atomic weapons, and to the recent press conference of Mr.
                <persName>Ollenhauer</persName> in which he had said that should the Social

              from this decision. The Chancellor said he did not think the <gloss target="#t_SPD1"
                >SPD</gloss> would be successful in forming the next government and he was confident
              the present government would remain in power. In this event it would insist that
              Allied troops in Germany should be equipped with the most modern and efficient
              weapons. The Chancellor added that it was obviously the intention of the <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> to undermine <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              whereas his government wished to see <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> made as
              strong as possible.</p>
            <p>As for the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> talks, the Chancellor said
              they had been conducted in a very good atmosphere, although at first he had been
              somewhat concerned over British insistence on building hydrogen weapons and reducing
              their conventional forces. The formula which had been agreed upon in the talks was
              that steps must be avoided under all circumstances which would produce any weakening
              of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and that in assessing the British as well as
              the overall <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> situation account must be taken of
              the German forces which are now being built up.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said he had later asked General Norstad if hydrogen weapons of British
              manufacture would come under his command. Norstad had replied in the negative but had
              said he could not conceive of a situation where the British would not cooperate fully
              with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in this matter. The Chancellor said that,
              as the Secretary was aware, the French were also considering manufacturing hydrogen
              weapons. Such a development, quite apart from French difficulties in Algeria, would
              involve further weakening of the conventional forces assigned to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Chancellor said he therefore saw a possibility
              (and he stressed this was only a possibility) of a development in the direction of a
              weakening of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> member states attempt to build up stocks of atomic weapons not coming
              under the control of the Supreme Commander while at the same time reducing the
              conventional forces under the Supreme Commander’s control. It was quite important
              whether the Supreme Commander had the power of control in this situation or was
              entirely dependent on the goodwill and understanding of the other parties. The
              Chancellor said he was aware the Secretary might not wish to comment on this problem
                <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>now but he had merely wished to direct
              attention to his concern over this potential development.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he was not clear whether the Chancellor was satisfied with the
              question of the disposition of the British reserve force, i.e., whether this should be
              stationed on the Continent or in the United Kingdom. The Chancellor said this problem
              had been discussed but no decision had been taken. The matter required the approval of
              the Council of Western European Union. This in turn required the advice of General
              Norstad which was not expected until some time during the summer. It therefore
              appeared that the decision of the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> Council could
              not take place before fall.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he wished to comment briefly on the Chancellor’s remarks about the
              position of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, not because he was interested in
              intervening in German internal affairs but because the question was of great
              importance to the posture of the free world. (The Chancellor interpolated that Mr.
                <persName>Ollenhauer</persName> had made the statements in question at a large press
              conference.) The Secretary drew the Chancellor’s attention to the world map behind
              him. He referred to Finland, where important mineral deposits had been taken over by
              the Soviet Union during the last war; to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which had
              been forcibly taken over by the Soviets; and to Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
              Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Albania, which had come under Soviet control solely as
              a result of the Soviet threat to use military force in these areas. On the other side
              of the world Mongolia, Tibet, North Korea, and North Viet-Nam had all been taken by
              Soviet force. All these aggressive expansions had occurred in areas where there were
              no collective security arrangements. On the other hand, in no area protected by such
              collective security arrangements had there been such aggression. The Secretary said he
              also wished to observe that the heart of collective security arrangements is the
              willingness of all parties thereto to use whatever force is necessary to repel
              aggression. He therefore could not but conclude, as had the Chancellor, that to leave
              such a vital area as the Federal Republic unprotected by collective security
              arrangements, or so poorly protected that it would become a tempting target for
              aggression, would represent a betrayal not only of the Federal Republic but also of
              others in the free world who were willing to stand beside the Federal Republic. We
              were trying to limit the danger that atomic weapons would be used in a manner contrary
              to the moral sense of those peoples who have any moral sense. But to agree to forego
              the availability in case of need of the most effective weapons would be as foolish as
              to have agreed to forego the use of gunpowder when this began to replace bows and
              arrows.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said he was in complete agreement with the Secretary. He was
              convinced, as he had already indicated, that his government <pb n="264"
                xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>would win the elections. He had wished to make the
              point only so that there would be no doubt the majority of the German people approved
              his government’s course of action. He wished to reiterate once again that both for
              Germany’s allies and for its own forces, his government wished to have the most modern
              and effective equipment available.</p>

            <p>The Secretary asked the Chancellor to speak on the fifth Agenda item, owing to his
              great interest in the subject and all that he had done on behalf of European
              integration.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said there would be no difficulty as far as Germany was concerned and
              he was confident that <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the Common
              Market would be ratified by the Bundestag in July before the summer recess. He was,
              however, concerned by the situation in Italy and France. In France, in particular, a
              prolongation of the government crisis could cause difficulties. No one could change
              this, however, and we must await developments. There was one case in which he felt the
              United States could help, namely, that of the Netherlands. The Dutch were planning to
              take up the ratification question only after the summer recess, and there was a danger
              that other countries might also wait for action of the Netherlands. If the Dutch could
              move faster it would benefit all of us. The Chancellor again affirmed that in Germany
              there was no problem and he was sure that the agreements would be ratified by a large
              majority.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he had found the statement on this subject in the communiqué on
              the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> talks<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2"
                >For text of this communiqué, dated May 9, see <hi rend="italic">Documents</hi>
                (R.I.I.A.) for 1957, pp. 386–387.</note> very good and that it represented an
              advance over the position taken by the British earlier. He was a bit surprised,
              however, over the Chancellor’s concern regarding Italy. He inquired if this was
              because of the governmental crisis.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor asked Foreign Minister Von Brentano to comment on this point. Brentano
              said that as regards Italy he believed <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"/>the
              new Italian government if confirmed in office would try to secure ratification with
              the support of parties not in the government. He was more concerned about France, even
              though there presently appeared to be a majority in the French Parliament for the
              agreements. If the governmental crisis were drawn out, mounting disagreements and
              tensions over other problems, such as Algeria, could have an adverse effect on
              ratification. He was, nevertheless, still optimistic over the outlook. As for England
              the British position, as the Secretary had indicated, had been clarified in the Bonn
              talks with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and Foreign
              Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>. The British had made it clear
              that they would no longer try to have the free trade area question settled prior to
              ratification of the Common Market; also that they were willing to postpone further
              discussion of the Grand Design, which could have interfered with ratification.</p>
            <p>Brentano said that he hoped the United States would continue to be helpful in <gloss
                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> when the Common Market plan was discussed there. It
              was expected other nations would cause difficulties with the Common Market plan. He
              referred to a similar tendency in <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to attack the
                <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> agreement. Brentano said the support of
              the United States Government would be welcomed in trying to get discussion of these
              questions deferred until after ratification.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that there was no doubt that the fall of the Mollet government
              would have a bad effect on the attitude of other countries, such as Italy. Certainly
              the United States would do all it could in any quarter to assist this matter forward.
              He had repeatedly emphasized to the French his opinion that failure on their part to
              ratify the Common Market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> agreements,
              following on the defeat of <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, would have a
              catastrophic effect on United States attitudes toward Europe. As for the Netherlands,
              he would be glad to look into the matter. He was aware that under Dutch constitutional
              requirements the ratification process was ponderous and slow-moving, and it might be
              hard to stir them into any speedier action.</p>

              <item>Disarmament</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Secretary said that we had the impression that the Soviets may be sincerely
              interested in a disarmament agreement. The reason, he believed, was that the burden of
              the present rate of armament on their economy was something which they would like to
              lighten. We are ourselves, with our strong industrial economy, finding it a
              considerable burden to devote ten per cent of our gross national product to armaments.
              The Soviets perhaps find it difficult to keep up with us, considering the fact that
              their gross national product is perhaps one-third of ours. We also think that they are
              concerned lest the possession of atomic weapons spread generally and are particularly
              concerned that some of the satellites might come into possession of atomic weapons and
              consequently exercise greater independence. The Soviets have recently shown greater
              interest in the treaty to establish an international atomic energy agency to exercise
              controls which would assure that atomic materials will be used only for peaceful
              purposes. In London they have exhibited considerable interest in what is called there
              the “fourth country problem”.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he himself would not place any particular confidence in what
              the Soviets say merely because they say it, but when what they say coincides with
              their self-interest, one can place some reliance on it. This is particularly true when
              our free world interest lies in the same direction. We had therefore concluded <pb
                n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>it was worthwhile to probe further as to what
              the Soviets would or would not do. The Secretary said it is basic that we would not do
              anything on the basis of a Soviet undertaking unless it can be controlled. We are
              alert to the fact that there is always a tendency on the part of the democracies to
              disarm, if there is the slightest excuse for doing so. We hope at least we would not
              follow the pattern which has happened so many times in our history, of limiting our
              armaments without reciprocal limitations, with the result that aggression follows.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he had had considerable international experience in his lifetime
              and he well realized the tendency of people to put faith in treaties which sound well,
              which are signed by people with well-known names, and which have seals and red ribbons
              on them. We were determined to seek an agreement which is not a trap. We had had very
              considerable discussion during the last few days in particular about the subject of
              disarmament. There had been meetings in the State Department under his chairmanship,
              at which the Defense Department, the Armed Services, the Atomic Energy Commission and
              other agencies of the government concerned had participated. The conclusions resulting
              from these meetings had been taken to the President on the previous Saturday and had
              been approved by the President.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">See <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v20#pg_513">vol. XX, pp. 513</ref> ff.</note> The Secretary
              said he wished the Chancellor to know that there was nothing in our position which was
              not fully approved by the Defense Department, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by the
              Secretary personally.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that one conclusion we had come to was that the aspects of the
              disarmament problem which particularly touched on Western Europe ought to be dealt
              with by more full participation of the Western European powers than is presently the
              case. We had received word that the other Western Powers which are active in the
              London disarmament negotiations, that is, the United Kingdom, France and Canada, this
              morning had agreed with this point of view. It would probably be presented at a
              meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council which we hoped would be
              held on the following day. The Secretary said we hoped that out of this discussion
              would come some program which would insure that the Western European countries and
                <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> would have a more active voice in the
              disarmament question and that responsibility would not devolve solely on the Four
              Western Powers involved in the London discussions.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he had thus far confined himself to a discussion of procedural
              matters. He now wished to take up the following questions of substance: (1) inspection
              and controls; (2) nuclear weapons; and (3) conventional weapons.</p>
            <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>
            <p>The Secretary said that as far as inspection and controls were concerned, the United
              States adheres to the position originally put forth by the President at Geneva.<note
                n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">For text of the President’s “Open Skies” proposal, see the
                  <ref target="frus1955-57v05#pg_447">vol. V, pp. 447</ref>–<ref
                  target="frus1955-57v05#pg_456">456</ref>.</note> This was that we would be ready
              to have aerial inspection and ground controls, either fixed or mobile, over all of the
              continental United States (and Canada, as well, if this were agreeable to the Canadian
              Government), if the U.S.S.R. would agree to the same arrangement for its territory.
              If, as we believe, the Soviets would reject this, we face the problem of what
              alternative arrangement could be made. It seemed to us that the alternative must then
              be a series of stages in which a beginning would be made where the problems were least
              difficult, with a gradual extension as circumstances permit. The Soviets had suggested
              an aerial inspection and ground control system over a slice of eastern Soviet
              territories in Siberia as against a slice of the United States including all of the
              United States west of the Mississippi. The Secretary said that our military people
              could see little advantage in inspection of only such a slice of the U.S.S.R.
              Furthermore, there would be great political difficulty for us in equating such a
              substantial part of the United States with even a substantial slice of Siberia, even
              if the areas were comparable on an acreage basis. While we have not arrived at any
              fixed conclusions and while there is considerable flexibility in our position, and we
              intend to probe Soviet intentions, it may be that the only feasible thing which can be
              done at present is to start on an experimental basis in areas relatively free from the
              political complications which the Secretary had referred to, that is, principally in
              the Arctic areas. The Secretary said he wished to repeat that our ideas were flexible
              and not fixed, but that our thinking was developing along these lines.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then turned to the subject of nuclear armaments. He said our
              suggestions have as their central purpose the suspension of the development and growth
              of nuclear weapons, at least for a period during which it could be ascertained whether
              nuclear weapons could be brought under control. It would be our suggestion that, after
              a date to be fixed, those countries which have nuclear weapons should agree not to use
              any further fissionable materials to produce weapons and that during this stage at
              least nations which do not have nuclear weapons should agree not to manufacture them.
              The Secretary said that an agreement not to put new fissionable material into weapons
              is the kind of an agreement which our experts tell us can be controlled. It would not
              be possible to account for past production of fissionable materials, but it could be
              determined whether new production was devoted to peaceful purposes.</p>
            <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0297"/>
            <p>The Secretary said we would also propose that nations which have fissionable
              materials at the agreed date should agree to take certain amounts out of their weapons
              stockpile and put them into a stockpile for peaceful purposes. Thus we might start
              initially in a modest way to check future fissionable materials production for
              military purposes and also to make some inroad in the stockpile already devoted to
              military purposes. The Secretary said he had alluded to the fact that we would propose
              that nations not possessing nuclear weapons might forego their production to see how
              this experiment goes. However, he wished to make it clear that we would not agree to
              withhold such weapons from our Allies if their importation were necessary to repel
              aggression. In other words, our proposals would not extend to what might be called a
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> stockpile, where U.S. weapons could be stored
              subject to the possibility of transfer to its Allies if the need for their use should
              arise, nor would our proposals preclude the training of our Allies in the use of
              nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we still feel that the suspension of nuclear tests should be
              coupled with some form of nuclear control. He said we had given most conscientious and
              thorough study to the problem. We were convinced, on the one hand, that the testing of
              nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future, if kept within certain limits, would not
              be injurious to human life. On the other hand, we were concerned over the possibility
              that the continuity of developing and testing weapons would be irrevocably interrupted
              by a suspension of tests while the Soviet development program would continue to go
              forward. This opened up the possibility of a Soviet breakthrough in this area because
              the Soviets would continue with their preparations while our whole establishment would
              be broken up and our scientists scattered.</p>
            <p>With respect to conventional weapons, the Secretary said that our proposals in the
              first stage are based on the concept of a reduction of forces by the U.S.S.R. and the
              United States to a level of armaments consistent with armed forces of 2,500,000 men.
              There might have to be some comparable ceilings for other Western powers which have a
              substantial military potential, although it is likely that U.K. forces will be below
              the ceiling before it can be agreed upon. Such countries as the Federal Republic,
              which are just beginning their build-up, would not be required to reduce their forces,
              but would be asked to accept some ceiling such as that established in the Brussels
                Treaty.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">For text of the Treaty of Economic, Social and

            <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0298"/>
            <p>The Secretary said he had referred to a level of armaments compatible with a certain
              number of men in the armed services. He said he thought that the number of men in the
              armed services at any one time is a most dangerous and elusive concept. He remarked
              that in the Brussels Treaty, the approach is that certain levels of forces are fixed,
              but the effective limitation is on the armaments appropriate to the number of forces.
              Armaments involve a less elusive and more definite concept than numbers of men, since
              men can be moved in and out of the military services if there are arms for them. The
              Secretary said we would think it appropriate that there be some reduction in armaments
              at the time when the agreed level is arrived at between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The
              Secretary said this involved difficult problems in comparing weapons. This was
              particularly difficult when it came to dealing with a country like the U.S.S.R., which
              we knew from experience always cheats on its agreements.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he did not attach great importance to the reductions which
              might be made in forces at the first stage. Reductions at the second stage, which
              would be of more significance, would be dependent on two things. One was the
              settlement of some of the major political issues in the world, such as the
              reunification of Germany. The second would be the establishment of roving, mobile
              controls within the Soviet Union. While it would be difficult to make such controls
              100 per cent effective in such a vast country as the U.S.S.R., some risks might be
              incurred if there had been a settlement of some of the major political problems. The
              Secretary said there was one other area he should mention, that is, guided missiles
              and outer space missiles. It is our thought that a commission might be established to
              study how to insure that the use of outer space missiles would be exclusively for
              peaceful purposes. We think this is a suitable area for study but not for agreement at
              this time.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that he was very
              grateful for the explanation which the Secretary had given. In his response he wished
              to go into some of these matters in some detail. However, before doing so, he wished
              to ask one question. When the Secretary had spoken of a first step, did he mean that
              this would deal only with aerial inspection or would it deal with other matters?</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we were thinking of aerial inspection plus ground controls in
              the inspected area, together with the establishment of an inspection system of atomic
              plants which would make it possible to control an agreement that future production
              would be used only for peaceful purposes. The establishment of controls in atomic
              plants would require about two years, so that it would take that period of time to
              bring into force the agreement to use future production of fissionable materials only
              for peaceful purposes. Initial steps in aerial inspection and ground controls could be
              brought into <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0299"/>force, we hope, in a few months’
              time. In addition, there would be a reduction of conventional forces as between the
              United States and the U.S.S.R., which would come into force in about twelve
              months.</p>
            <p>In response to a further question from the Chancellor, the Secretary said he wished
              to make clear that, in our opinion, a first stage Treaty should include the following
              matters: <list>
                <label>1.</label>
                <item>Aerial and ground inspection in some areas, perhaps not of great significance,
                  primarily to make sure that controls of this character can be implemented.</item>
                <label>2.</label>
                <item>An agreement to abstain from future productions of nuclear weapons, both on
                  the part of nations which have such weapons and on the part of nations which do
                  not have them.</item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>A reduction of the forces of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to a level of
                  2,500,000. He remarked that he did not attach great military importance to this
                  aspect of the Treaty.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>The Secretary said a first stage Treaty involves all of these arrangements, although
              they would come into force at different times depending on the time required to set up
              protective controls which might be as much as two years in respect to some
              matters.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor asked whether there would be an armament stop in this period.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said there would not be.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor asked whether, therefore, during this time, and until there was an
              effective control, the development of armament could go on.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said this was correct except as regards the limit of 2,500,000 men in
              the U.S. and Soviet forces. The Chancellor remarked this was probably not of great
              significance and the Secretary said our Forces would probably be at that level at any
              rate. The whole modern trend is toward reduction in the number of men as the
              effectiveness of weapons increases.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that in the first part of the Secretary’s statement he had spoken
              of countries belonging to the Soviet Union. He asked whether this would cover Red
              China.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we did not contemplate that, as part of the first stage,
              controls would be established over Red China. We did contemplate the inclusion in the
              Treaty of a provision under which if military developments and activities in Red China
              made it desirable, the U.S. could call off the arrangement. It was intended to
              approach the matter in that form in order to avoid the political problem of
              recognizing and dealing with Red China. The problem would be dealt with negatively
              rather than positively, so to speak.</p>
            <p>After referring to his notes, the Chancellor said that the statement by the Secretary
              to which he had referred was that the U.S. would be prepared to agree to the
              inspection of the entire continental <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0300"/>area of
              the U.S. if the U.S.S.R. would subject all its territory to inspection. Did this
              statement cover Red China, he asked.</p>
            <p>The Secretary responded that it related only to the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor asked whether the satellites would be covered. The Secretary said they
              would not. He recalled that the original proposal made by the President at Geneva
              covered only the territory of the U.S.S.R. He said that our military authorities felt
              that if inspection were extended to the whole of the U.S.S.R. and not merely to a part
              which would be sealed off from the rest, we would gain greatly. He said the fact of
              the matter was that, as far as the U.S. is concerned, there is little that the
              U.S.S.R. cannot learn. It is possible to buy at most book stores maps and pictures of
              military establishments in the U.S. It is possible to fly over most of the U.S. except
              for six restricted areas. Anyone can hire a Piper Cub and photograph anything except
              in theory in these restricted areas. In fact, one can fly high enough to get most of
              these areas.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that an agreement enabling us to fly over the U.S.S.R. would give
              us much and would add very little to Soviet knowledge. For this reason, he believed it
              was certain that the U.S.S.R. would continue to reject our proposal. The Secretary
              said that we actually see no military disadvantage in agreeing to inspection of part
              of the U.S. in exchange for the right to inspect part of Siberia. We would gain from
              such an arrangement. However, it raised the political difficulty of equating part of
              the U.S. for part of Siberia.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that, while his information was perhaps not correct, he had
              understood that the U.S. had such an inspection over the U.S.S.R. Two and one-half
              years ago he had received a visit from high ranking American officers who had showed
              him apparatus which they said they could use by flying in the air stream over the
              Soviet Union. They also showed him pictures which had been taken.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he wished this were true. While we had some useful pictures, they
              were only of a small part of the U.S.S.R. It was not feasible at the present time,
              whether through over-flights or through use of balloons to cover all of the
              U.S.S.R.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he did not wish to go into these technical details but would
              like to make some general remarks. He said he thought he agreed freely that the U.S.,
              as the leading power of the Western world, should make every effort to reach an
              agreement with the U.S.S.R. on disarmament. The question of timing, however, was of
              very great importance. That is, when one should go to the U.S.S.R. with a generous
              proposal. The Chancellor said that he was sorry to say that he could see no sign of
              the Russians wishing to come to an agreement with the West. He recalled the talks
              which he <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0301"/>had with <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at Moscow
              in 1955.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">See <ref target="frus1955-57v05#pg_573">vol. V,
                  pp. 573</ref> ff.</note> He and Von Brentano had had a lengthy discussion of a
              very frank character with them. They had been told that the Soviets found it very
              difficult to meet the demands of their population, to rearm at the rate necessary to
              keep pace with the U.S., and to meet the demands of Red China. The Soviets had asked
              the Germans to help them with Red China. They had not said anything about disarmament.
              What they had said was that they were afraid of the U.S., and also, perhaps for
              reasons of politeness, that they were afraid of the Germans. The principal point which
              they had made was that they were afraid of the U.S. and that they found it necessary
              to keep up with the U.S. in the arms field.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that the Germans had, of course, rejected the Soviet proposal. He
              thought that the important thing was that the Soviets had not said anything about
              disarmament. The Chancellor said, that in looking back to October 1955, that he
              thought he should frankly say that the power of the U.S.S.R. had increased. There were
              several factors involved. The first was that the power of the West had diminished.
              This was due in part to difficulties between the U.S. and the British and French. In
              the second place, the U.K. had, to some extent left the framework of <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Soviet Union on the other hand had crushed the
              revolt in Hungary and managed to keep Poland under control and had extended its
              influence in the Middle East. The Chancellor said that he did not wish to say that the
              Soviet Union was stronger than the U.S., but he did think the power of the Soviets had
              increased relatively.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that this was a subject on which one could not furnish proof. One
              theory was as good as another. However, he thought that one should consider what the
              results might be of unsuccessful negotiations. The will of some countries to resist
              the Soviets would diminish. The Soviets would believe that if proposals had been made
              to them and rejected, other proposals would be made. The essential question was
              whether the Soviets had given up their goal of world domination. He personally did not
              believe that they had.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that, as he remarked at the beginning, this was a situation in
              which a solution must be found without war. If the United States believed that the
              time had come that the Soviets were prepared to give up their aim to dominate the
              world, the other countries of the free world must accept this view. However, taking
              such a decision placed a great responsibility on the United States, perhaps a greater
              responsibility than had ever been placed upon any American Administration. If the
              negotiations failed and there were a <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0302"/>loss of
              confidence in the United States, the United States would have lost everything that it
              had been working for for a period of years. The Chancellor said that this was a
              question of such seriousness that he felt it desirable to be completely frank in
              discussing it.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that the proposal raises particular problems for Germany. The
              Secretary had said we must avoid anything which would perpetuate the continued
              division of Germany. He had also said that responsibility must devolve on other
              countries and that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be consulted regarding
              disarmament on Wednesday. It would be impossible for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> Ambassadors to be in a position to comment on proposals at a meeting
              on Wednesday without having consulted their governments.</p>
            <p>With specific regard to Germany, the Chancellor referred to the discussions which had
              taken place in the morning meeting<note n="6" xml:id="d116fn6">See <ref target="#d113"
                  >Documents 113</ref>–<ref target="#d115">115</ref>.</note> and particularly to the
              point he had made that the German elections would be of decisive importance to the
              entire Western world. He said that if the proposals to be made at London could be used
              for propaganda purposes and if it could be portrayed that steps were being taken in
              the disarmament field without laying a basis for political settlements, this would
              have a very serious effect on the German elections. He said he frankly could see no
              chance for the Government.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he was glad that the Chancellor had asked these questions. In
              the first place, the Chancellor had asked whether we thought the Soviets had renounced
              their desire to rule the world. His answer was that they had not. However, there was
              more than one way to winning the domination of the world. It might be possible that
              the Soviets might be willing to renounce the effort to dominate the world by military
              forces if they thought they could achieve it by other means.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that if the West, and particularly the United States, were not
              willing to deal in any way with the problem of disarmament, we would have undermined
              the confidence of many peoples in the Western governments, and particularly in the
              United States Government. The Secretary said the Chancellor had spoken of a possible
              loss of confidence in the United States. He thought that confidence in the United
              States, to the extent that it exists, rests, not only on the fact that we are strong,
              but on the belief of other people that we are sincerely devoted to peace and freedom
              and that we want to find ways of lightening the burden of armaments on mankind.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that the first phase of steps we are considering are certainly of
              such a character that they will in no way limit and will in fact increase the military
              strength of the United States. <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0303"/>We have some
              chance of finding out through aerial inspection something about the Soviet Union that
              we do not know in exchange for something that they know. In the nuclear field, we
              propose that materials should not be used for weapons at a time when our stockpile is
              larger, perhaps several times larger, than that of the Soviets. We do not propose to
              diminish our weapons stockpile, nor to abandon the bases from which we could stage an
              attack on the U.S.S.R., if necessary. In other words, our proposals would leave us in
              a position of superiority.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he did not believe that such an initial step would be
              interpreted as giving up our superiority or endanger any part of the free world. On
              the contrary, it would freeze our superiority.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he thought that anything less than this in the first stage
              would be interpreted throughout the world and indeed in the United States as a trend
              toward militarism which was not appropriate to a free and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                >Christian</persName> people.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that the Chancellor had referred to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> meeting on Wednesday. He felt he must have failed to make his point
              clear. It had never entered his mind that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              representatives would express views at the meeting on Wednesday. The purpose of the
              meeting was to tell the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries our view that
              they should organize themselves to take a greater role and responsibility in the field
              of disarmament. When the disarmament discussions touched on issues such as German
              reunification and the situation in the satellites, we felt that the <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries should have the opportunity and, indeed,
              the responsibility of participating. We had in mind a greater degree of participation
              than is gained by an occasional report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, an
              occasional discussion with an Ambassador in London or a meeting such as the one which
              he was having with the Chancellor. Although his meeting with the Chancellor was highly
              useful and afforded him an opportunity to give the Chancellor our thoughts to a degree
              which few people in the United States Government knew them, it was, nevertheless, more
              or less accidental and would probably not be repeated within the next few months. The
              whole purpose of our approach to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was to propose
              to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries that they organize themselves
              to participate effectively in the disarmament problem. The Secretary said he
              personally believed that their countries should have continuous representation in
              London somewhat similar to the representation the Germans had had at the Geneva
              Conference in 1955.</p>
            <p>Herr von Brentano said he wished to ask a question. The Chancellor had indicated, and
              there was no need to stress, that the Germans were interested in a relaxation of
              tension. However, he was somewhat concerned as to how Germany would be affected by the
                <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0304"/>proposals. As he understood it, the
              proposals would comprehend inspection, limits on nuclear weapons and some limitations
              on conventional forces. He asked whether he could assume that the proposals would
              cover Europe.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that the United States did not assume this. We did not think that
              the first phase of the effort should touch Europe in any way. We further felt that
              before anything was done affecting Europe, the European countries should organize
              themselves so that they could participate effectively and accept greater
              responsibility in this area. He said that we did not wish to be in a position of
              simply telling the Europeans what was being done. We wish them to decide for
              themselves what should be done. He said the United States could not think for Germany,
              but that Germany should think for itself and participate in the development of such a
              program. The Secretary said that our thinking was at this time there should be no
              over-flights in Europe, no ground controls in Europe and no limitation of conventional
              forces in Europe. These should be left until we come to the second stage, which would
              be based upon European participation. He indicated that he felt that participation was
              particularly necessary in the case of Germany, the Benelux countries and possibly
              Italy. If the European countries involved wanted Europe dealt with in the first stage,
              we would have no objection. However, it was not part of our proposal.</p>
            <p>Herr von Brentano said that he was still somewhat concerned about what the Secretary
              had said. If he understood it correctly, an attempt would be made to reach a
              comprehensive agreement on disarmament between the United States and the Soviet Union.
              It was psychologically impossible for an agreement to be reached between the larger
              countries without affecting the smaller countries. One could not limit the armament of
              the larger powers without limiting the armament of the smaller powers. As he
              understood the proposal, it would mean that Britain would in fact leave <gloss
                target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>. It would mean the implicit confirmation of the
              division of Germany. This would create great problems in Germany. He said he wished to
              raise these problems, not because he was a German, but because of the importance of
              the German problem to all countries. If the feeling developed in Germany—that the
              division of Germany had been accepted and that an agreement on disarmament would be
              based on the division of Germany, the reaction would be very bad and might affect
              other countries, as well.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he thought that to describe what we proposed as a
              comprehensive agreement was going far beyond what was actually contemplated. All that
              was contemplated was what he had already outlined involving the inspection of areas
              remote from Europe. It did not involve areas where the problem of freezing the <pb
                n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0305"/>political situation was an issue. It touched on
              the problem of disarmament only by proposing that the atomic stockpiles of the United
              States and the U.S.S.R. be frozen at their present levels. This would involve the
              Soviets conceding U.S. superiority in this field and abandonment of the Soviet effort
              to catch up with the United States. The proposed reduction of conventional forces to
              2,500,000 had been put forward a long time ago. It had no substantive
              significance.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said Herr von Brentano had spoken of the United Kingdom leaving <gloss
                target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>. He could not see any connection between these
              proposals and the Brussels Pact. The Brussels Pact would not be affected, nor would
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, nor would the United Kingdom forces in
              Germany, nor would our ability to meet a Soviet attack.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that none of these substantive proposals were new. The proposal
              for reciprocal aerial inspection had been made by the President at Geneva. The
              proposal of a cut-off date for the production of nuclear weapons had been made at
              least six months ago. The limitation of 2,500,000 men had been made a long time ago.
              The only new thing was that we did not think the arrangements should apply to Europe
              until there had been a settlement of the political problems in Europe. In other words,
              we were cutting back our proposals until the conditions described by Herr von Brentano
              could be dealt with. We did not wish to go into these problems until Germany was in a
              position to deal with these matters.</p>
            <p>Herr von Brentano said he did not wish to be misunderstood. He acknowledged the
              accuracy of what the Secretary had said. On the other hand, he did not wish to have
              the impression created that there would be relaxation of tension separate from the
              settlement of political problems. This was why the Germans had suggested that it be
              stated that, because there were new negotiations in prospect, it was desirable to
              solve the political problems. This was why they wished to propose a future Four Power
              conference. This would make it clear that there was a connection between the
              disarmament negotiations and the solution of the German problem.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said we would have no objection to making clear in any way that in our
              view a comprehensive disarmament agreement was not possible without a solution of some
              of the major political problems, such as the reunification of Germany. Our own working
              papers reflect this. The essence of the decision which we had just made, which he had
              thought would be pleasing to the Germans, was that it was not possible to have the
              degree of disarmament which had been previously discussed without European
              participation. The political responsibility was too great for us to bear.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that as far as inspection was concerned, we were proposing to do
              it only on an experimental basis. We did not even wish it to apply to the European
              area without full German and <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0306"/>other European
              participation in the decision. He remarked that it was Governor <persName
                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>’s opinion that the Soviets would not be willing
              to accept real inspection and ground controls unless they cover Europe. If this were
              so, the question would then be up to the Germans and their European colleagues to
              decide. We would not urge them. The Secretary said he himself had thought we were
              purporting to speak in London for other countries to too great an extent without
              having a mandate to do so. We did not wish to do so any longer.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said he wished to ask a question. The Secretary said he had not
              answered all of Herr von Brentano’s questions. The Chancellor said perhaps his
              question would in fact deal with these unanswered questions. The Secretary had spoken
              of agreements regarding three matters, air and ground inspection, nuclear weapons and
              conventional forces. His question was to what extent such a proposal would affect
              American participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Secretary said,
              not at all. The Chancellor said the agreement would be a very good agreement in this
              case.</p>
            <p>Herr von Brentano referred to the German suggestion regarding a Four Power conference
              and requested the Secretary’s views. The Secretary said he thought that the proposal
              was an interesting one but that he doubted that it could be made in the communiqué. He
              did not think we could confront our Allies with a statement on this subject before
              they had been consulted.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that, in point of fact, the same proposal had been made by some
              people in our own government recently and we had been considering it during the last
              ten days. He found it interesting that the Germans had made the same proposal. The
              Secretary said that while he felt the proposal had some merit, he was afraid it might
              operate as an enticement to the Soviets to accept things in the disarmament agreement
              on the basis of the feeling that they would gain more than we would out of a Four
              Power conference. He thought we would need to weigh very carefully what we would gain
              from such a conference. He was not sure we had gained very much out of the Geneva
              conferences. He was not sure what we would gain out of another Four Power conference.
              On the other hand, he thought some way should and could be found to link a
              comprehensive disarmament agreement with the reunification of Germany.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he wished to point out that what the Soviets want most out of a
              disarmament agreement was not comprehended in what we were now proposing to do. For a
              long time the Soviets had pressed in particular for three things. One was the
              liquidation of all foreign bases. This was not touched in any way. The second was the
              withdrawal of United States forces from Europe. This was not touched in any way
              either. The third was the liquidation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>. This was not touched in any way. The Secretary
              said that, <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0307"/>in other words, the things which
              the Soviets really want, even inspection in Europe, would not be touched in our
              proposals. It was implicit in our proposals that the extension of these arrangements
              would be dependent on the solution of some of the major political problems, notably
              the reunification of Germany.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that he was not certain whether we could usefully add a Four Power
              conference to these proposals. If he hesitated, there were two reasons for doing so.
              One was the need for consulting our allies. The other was whether such a conference
              would in fact be an asset to us. He thought that we could make it clear that there
              could not be an effective general disarmament plan unless there were reunification. As
              far as a possible Four Power conference was concerned, we would, of course, give great
              weight to German views.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he would like to think this entire matter over.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he hoped that the Chancellor would take the time to think it over.
              He was satisfied it was the kind of policy which the Chancellor would want us to
              adopt. He wished to make clear again that what we were considering was a very limited
              agreement and not a comprehensive agreement, that it need not apply to Germany or to
              Europe, and that from the standpoint of procedure, we proposed to bring Europe and
              particularly Germany into the discussion of the problem. These were the only new
              points. Everything else was old.</p>

            <p>The Chancellor said he was glad of a chance to talk with me privately about
              personalities. He was anxious to know what we thought about Krekeler as Ambassador.
              Was he adequate? The Chancellor said he felt that Von Kessel was abler, but he was not
              quite so sure as to his complete integrity. He was going to have this further
              checked.</p>
            <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0308"/>
            <p>I said that I considered Krekeler a thoroughly competent Ambassador with whom we got
              along very well. Perhaps he was not as forceful as some and it was not, of course,
              possible for me to judge the accuracy of his reporting, but we had no criticism to
              make of him. The Chancellor said he was always thinking about the problem of a
              successor. He felt there was no obvious successor in sight and that if he won the
              election he would probably have to hold on for a time. He had thought of Von Brentano
              as one of three or four who might possibly succeed him. As I did not personally know
              the others of whom he was thinking, he saw no point in mentioning their names to me.
              He thought Von Brentano smoked too much and that that made him nervous. He said he had
              told Von Brentano last night that he should stop smoking.</p>
            <p>I spoke in turn of some personalities. I said we hoped that he had been pleased with
              Ambassador Bruce, whom we regarded as one of our ablest diplomats. I said I felt he
              might be more politically minded than Ambassador Conant, who had been a very learned
              person but perhaps somewhat lacking in a political touch. The Chancellor said the
              trouble with Conant was that he was too “liberal”.</p>
            <p>I referred to a remark which the Chancellor had made a year before when he spoke of
                <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> very highly. 1 said we had
              contemplated <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> would be Assistant
              Secretary for European Affairs, but that his health had made this impracticable.</p>
            <p>Having in mind what AWD had reported of the Chancellor’s concern regarding
              developments within our own government, I said that Secretary <persName
                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> would soon be replaced by Mr.
                <persName>Anderson</persName>, and I spoke of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s
              high qualifications and experience, and indicated I thought he had more of an
              international viewpoint than Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
              >Humphrey</persName>. I said there might be some early change in the Defense
              Department, but this would not have any significant bearing on our international
              policies. I said as far as I was concerned, I had no present intention of resigning
              and that there was complete harmony between the President and myself with respect to
              all aspects of foreign policy. I referred to the fact that Governor <persName
                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> was now working under me and not as an
              independent agent of the President. The Chancellor expressed his gratification of this
              fact, of which he apparently had not been informed.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor indicated the importance of our talking more with some of the European
              countries. I asked what others he referred to, to the Benelux countries for example?
              He said no, France and Britain. This phase of the talk was quite obscure to me.</p>
            <p>I mentioned that we had learned in a reliable way that someone in the German
              Government had been reported to inform <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
              and/or <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> of the fact that in my first talk
              with the Chancellor I had spoken of the declining position of the UK in world affairs
              and <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>speaking of their present defense program
              had said that they were not able to play the part they had done before the First World
              War. This apparently had been reported to <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                >Macmillan</persName> and/or <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> in a way
              which made it seem that 1 was deprecating British greatness. I said I was concerned at
              the fact that such an intimate talk as I had should in garbled form be passed on to
              the British for no purpose I could see except to make trouble. The Chancellor seemed
              greatly concerned and disposed to doubt the accuracy of my statement. When I said it
              seemed to be correct without doubt, he said he would study the matter further from the
              standpoint of checking on who had been present when we talked; it was hard for him to
              believe any leak to the British had occurred.</p>

            <p>The President welcomed the Chancellor. He said that he had expected that the meeting
              would be conducted in a slightly less formal atmosphere. Given the character of the
              meeting, he would suggest that the Chancellor raise such matters as he cared to
              discuss.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor thanked the President. He said that he could only report that he and
              the Secretary had had several very good talks, the results of which were reflected in
              the draft communiqué.<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">Not found in Department of State
                files. For texts of the communiqué and declaration issued by the President and the
                Chancellor on May 28, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June
                17, 1957, pp. 955–956.</note> On their way to the White House, they had discussed a
              possible change in the communiqué), in the paragraph dealing with disarmament, on
              which he believed they had reached agreement. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
              that no language had been agreed. He thought there had been agreement that it might be
              made clear that somewhat active participation on the part of the Federal Republic in
              the disarmament negotiations was contemplated. He thought he could work out some
              language on the point with Foreign Minister Von Brentano.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he would like the language to say that the Federal Republic
              would be consulted not only as a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, but
              because its interests were affected.</p>
            <p>The President said that he wished to make clear that the United States does not
              intend to take up in any international conference any matter in which one of our
              allies is concerned and to take decisive action on it without the consent of that
              ally. He said it would not only be discourteous to do so; it would be foolish. The
              President suggested that the point the Chancellor had in mind might be expressed by
              including a short sentence in the communiqué stating that nothing affecting Germany
              could have force or effect without the consent of Germany. He suggested that the
              drafting of the exact language be left to Herr von Brentano and Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName>. He thought there was no difference in intent.</p>
            <p>The President asked whether the Chancellor had any other points to raise on the
              communiqué. The Chancellor said he did not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he and Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had had a long talk on disarmament the previous
              afternoon at which he had explained American thoughts on this subject very fully.<note
                n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">See <ref target="#d116">Document 116</ref>.</note> He had
              told the Chancellor that he had been given our thinking more fully than had been done
              with any of our allies to date and more than most people in the United States
              Government. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the Chancellor had a very
              natural concern lest we should make a comprehensive disarmament agreement covering the
              entire area under <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>discussion, including
              continental Europe, without adequate consideration for the need of avoiding prejudice
              to the reunification of Germany. He said he thought he had made clear to the
              Chancellor that the principal evolution of our thinking had been along lines much in
              accord with the Chancellor’s thoughts. In particular, we had become increasingly aware
              of the difficulty of applying a system of inspection and control in Europe until the
              question of German reunification was taken care of. We were, therefore, prepared to
              leave this matter out of the first stage of disarmament, until the reunification
              question could be taken care of.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he had also told the Chancellor that it was
              our feeling there was a tendency on the part of the four Western powers who were
              carrying on the disarmament negotiations in London to assume too much responsibility
              vis-à-vis other countries. It was, therefore, our intention to seek more active
              participation by other powers. He had made this point to the Chancellor in particular
              in their discussion the previous day and it would be raised with our other continental
              allies at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting on the following day. The
              problem of how to work out procedures for participation was still before us. This also
              was involved in the statement in the last page of the communiqué on which language
              remained to be worked out.</p>
            <p>The President remarked that the language of the communiqué looked fine to him.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that, as Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> had said, he had given the Chancellor on the previous
              day a very full account of the American views on disarmament. After thinking over what
              Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had said to him on the previous evening and in the
              conversation which they had had that morning, he could now say that he was in full
              agreement with the American position.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Communiqué</hi></p>
            <p>It was then agreed that the communiqué be issued as soon as possible. Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> suggested that agreement on the language on disarmament
              be reached immediately. The German representatives suggested that some additional
              words be added to the sentence at the beginning of the last paragraph of the
              communiqué reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquotE">
                <p>“The President stressed that any measures for disarmament applicable to Europe
                  would be accepted by the United States only with the approval of the <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, which he hoped would take a leading role
                  in this regard”.</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>They suggested adding the phrase: <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>
              <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“and in connection with the reopening of negotiations on European security and
                  German reunification”.</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>The President thought this language might cause some difficulty. Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that it seemed to suggest that <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had responsibility for German reunification. He
              pointed out that the previous paragraph referred to the responsibility of the four
              powers for this question.</p>
            <p>Professor Grewe then suggested as a substitute the addition of the following words to
              the sentence: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“and taking into account the link between European security and German
                  reunification”.</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>The President and the Secretary agreed to this suggestion.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">German Assets in the United States</hi></p>
            <p>The discussion on this subject is recorded in a separate memorandum.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d118fn4">The memorandum focused on a brief and general discussion of German
                assets in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> noted
                that there might be a way to solve the problem without using American tax funds. The
                President added that the matter of assets had given him and the Secretary “much
                anxious thought”. The President concluded: “However, this was a matter of law, and
                it was not always easy to persuade Congress to solve problems in a manner one would
                like.” (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 62 D 181, CF 888)</note></p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Financial Support for United States Forces in
                Germany</hi></p>
            <p>Ambassador Bruce raised the question of financial support by the Federal Republic of
              American forces in Germany. He pointed out that this had been discussed by the
              Chancellor and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Bonn on May
                4,<note n="5" xml:id="d118fn5">See <ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>.</note> at
              which time an agreement had been reached. The question of working out suitable
              language was still pending. He asked whether Foreign Minister Von Brentano could say
              whether he thought the matter could be worked out in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Herr von Brentano said he was not prepared for a discussion on this subject. However,
              he was familiar with the matter. At the meeting on May 4, Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> had said that there was a problem of presentation from
              the viewpoint of the American Congress and had suggested that the United States make a
              reservation allowing it to raise the question again later. The Chancellor had pointed
              out that this would give rise to difficulties with the Bundestag. Language on the
              subject was now being negotiated in Bonn. Herr von Brentano read the American and
              German formulations for the United States reservation. He suggested that there was no
              difference in substance between <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0313"/>the two
              texts. He said that the presentation in the German draft would be better from the
              viewpoint of the German Bundestag.</p>
            <p>The President said he understood that the matter was then only a question of
              phraseology.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that this would be a subject of Congressional
              interrogation and would be of particular interest to the Defense Department. Secretary
              Quarles said that the more definite the reservation could be, the better the position
              of the Administration before Congress would be.</p>
            <p>The President said he realized that the Chancellor had several speeches to make.<note

              fact, the meeting might be brought to a close. Assuming that both he and the
              Chancellor would for the next few years continue in their present positions, he hoped
              that the Chancellor would find it possible to visit him again. He felt that these
              visits were always very useful from the American viewpoint. The Chancellor thanked the
              President. He said that each of his visits had been most profitable to him, not only
              in terms of the specific matters which he had dealt with, but in learning to
              appreciate increasingly the qualities of the American people and the American way of
              life.</p>

            <p>The Chancellor began the conversation by thanking the Senators for agreeing to meet
              with him in private. The Chancellor said he saw difficult times ahead in Europe. He
              said he greeted the efforts of the United States to reach an agreement with the
              Soviets because only such an agreement could solve the problems of the world. But the
              way to such an agreement was long and filled with dangers and in order to reach a
              successful conclusion and to avoid these dangers, the true character of the Soviets
              must be known and constantly borne in mind. The Chancellor said he did not wish to
              exaggerate but that the freedom of Europe was vital to the continued freedom of the
              United States. Germany and Europe and the United States continued to be in a perilous
              position which only the strength and wisdom of the United States as the main power of
              the free world could withstand. The Chancellor said that the future was unclear but
              that Soviet aims were very clear. The Soviets would attempt to dissolve the alliance
              of the free world in order to achieve eventual domination of the world. They knew that
              their main battle would be against the United States, which would have to remain
              strong and alert.</p>
            <p>Senator Johnson said he believed he spoke for the other Senators when he said that he
              shared fully the same doubts with regard to the intentions of the Soviets as the
              Chancellor and that the United States would do its utmost to retain its strength and
              its alertness with regard to the future.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated that the character of the Soviets was deceptive and difficult
              to measure. He said he had felt the same feelings of doubt and uncertainty with regard
              to the rise of the Nazis. It remained inexplicable, he said, how the German people
              could have followed “Hitler and his bandits” but at the same time he could not
              understand why the outside world had helped Hitler so much by giving him recognition
              and stature through agreements and through such actions as participation in the 1936
              Olympic Games which were of tremendous psychological assistance to Hitler. The
              Chancellor said it was clear that an attempt must be made to come to terms with the
              Soviets but that the West, and the United States in particular, must be cautious,
              careful and acute in these dealings with the Soviets.</p>
            <p>Senator Johnson said he was grateful for these remarks by the Chancellor. He said
              that as far as the Legislature of the United States was concerned that the Chancellor
              was in the presence of the four or five men in the United States who would be most
              cautious and most reserved in going into any arrangements with the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor thanked the Senators and the meeting was terminated.</p>

            <p>In a group consisting of the Chancellor, Von Brentano, the Vice President, David

              President to Berlin in connection with the dedication of the Benjamin Franklin
              Auditorium and the possibility of the timing of this which would be appropriate in
              relation to the German elections. Considerable interest in this was shown by the

            <p>The meeting was arranged, at German request, to discuss protection of the civilian
              population. It was anticipated in this connection that Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> might wish to et some details concerning the
              program under which the U.S. will test certain shelters of German design at the Nevada
              proving grounds this year.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> welcomed the Chancellor and stated that rather than
              attempt to give a set briefing it might be more useful if he could deal with matters
              of specific interest to the German side. Since the conversation thereafter consisted
              entirely of questions put by the Chancellor, with replies by Mr.
                <persName>Peterson</persName>, it will be reproduced below in that form.</p>
            <p>Q. We understand that at one time you were thinking in terms of civil defense by
              means of evacuation from the cities, but that you have now shifted over to a shelter
              program. Is this correct?</p>
            <p>A. Not entirely. At the time we were stressing evacuation only, the danger from
              fallout was not fully appreciated. Fallout shelters can be built fairly cheaply,
              however, and while our thinking now is still in terms of evacuation, we are also
              stressing the need for adequate shelter against fallout, so that the lives of people
              who may have gotten safely away from the cities will not be endangered by fallout some
              distance away.</p>
            <p>Evacuation is practicable today only because we believe we can count on 3–5 hours
              warning against attacks other than from submarines. The coming of the
              inter-continental ballistic missile, which will cut warning time down to 15–30
              minutes, will clearly mean that evacuation is impossible. We have no shelters at
              present, however, <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>and will have to rely
              solely on evacuation until shelters are built or until the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                >ICBM</gloss> is here.</p>
            <p>Q. A couple of years ago you had tests which called for moving the Federal Government
              out of Washington. Is this still the plan?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, if time permits,</p>
            <p>Q. Would this involve all government officials? A. No, just those essential to
              maintain vital functions of government.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you have special shelters outside Washington?</p>
            <p>A. We have re-location sites, some underground, for all necessary personnel.</p>
            <p>Q. <gloss target="#t_WHO1">Who</gloss> pays for these, the Federal or State
              Governments?</p>
            <p>A. The Federal Government. We are encouraging State and municipal authorities to take
              similar action.</p>
            <p>Q. If shelters were constructed for the population in New York, for example, would
              the Federal, State, or City Government pay for them?</p>
            <p>A. This has not been decided. <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss> has made a
              proposal, now under consideration by the President, which would call for the Federal
              Government’s bearing the greater part of the cost. It is our feeling that if the
              States and municipalities give the necessary land, and maintain the shelters when
              built, this would be a fair proportion of the burden for them to carry.</p>
            <p>Q. Is there any legislative or other authority making it compulsory that new
              buildings have adequate shelters built-in at time of construction?</p>
            <p>A. No, and unfortunately the Federal Government is setting a bad example in this
              respect. The new State Department building, for instance, has no provision for
              shelters.</p>
            <p>Q. Obviously the State Department counts on obtaining peace.</p>
            <p>A. We all hope so. But I did not mean to emphasize the State Department
              particularly—it is general throughout the Government. I am certain that we will
              eventually come to a shelter program. We will be forced to put some of our industries
              underground, as in Norway, Sweden, and I believe, Russia.</p>
            <p>Q. I am sure you are aware of this, but the Russians built the Moscow subway 60
              meters underground. <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> told me that they
              can protect the entire population of Moscow, that the subway, for instance, can be
              furnished with food and water, and sealed off to protect those inside. I don’t know,
              of course, whether it is true that adequate shelter provision has been made for the
              entire Moscow population.</p>
            <p>A. Well, everything the Russians say is not necessarily true. And all of it is not
              necessarily untrue, for that matter.</p>
            <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0318"/>
            <p>We have made a study in St. <persName corresp="#p_GLW1">Louis</persName>, a typical
              American city, which shows that if there were adequate shelters capable of bearing an
              over-pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, 60% of the population could be saved in
              event of an attack, even giving the enemy every advantage of surprise, accuracy of
              bomb delivery, etc.</p>
            <p>The shelters we are testing for you are capable of withstanding 180 pounds per square
              inch, and I think you are definitely on the right track.</p>
            <p>Q. We are glad to hear this. I would like to get additional details in the civil
              defense field, and I would like if possible for Minister of Interior Schroeder to come
              over in June for this.</p>
            <p>A. He would be quite welcome.</p>
            <p>Q. Good, then Ambassador Krekeler will be in touch with you as to details of the
              visit. One more question at this time—do you have authority to tell the States what to
              do or is <gloss target="#t_FCDA1">FCDA</gloss>’s capacity purely advisory?</p>
            <p>A. In wartime, I would have virtually unlimited power as the President’s
              representative in this field. In peacetime, however, <gloss target="#t_FCDA1"
                >FCDA</gloss> has very limited powers. This is one of the major difficulties we
              face.</p>
            <p>I might say that the best civil defense work in the free world is being carried out
              in Norway and Sweden. They have teeth in their laws, they can draft people for civil
              defense, and most important, they are going underground, and really getting adequate
              shelters. There is no question in my mind that they are better prepared than any other
              country in the world to withstand an atomic attack.</p>
            <p>Q. You are aware of Dr. <persName>Schweitzer</persName>’s statements on the danger of
              fallout. What do you think of this?</p>
            <p>A. There is no question, of course, that radioactivity can be transferred (from grass
              to cow to milk to human beings, etc.). But to our best knowledge there is no threat to
              human life from atomic tests, and we do not feel that tests have contributed
              significantly to the total radioactivity in the world. If war comes and hundreds of
              bombs are dropped, that will of course be another question.</p>
            <p>As far as tests are concerned, the sooner we quit testing the better, but as much as
              we abhor war, we cannot accept a dishonorable peace either, so that testing
              unfortunately remains necessary in view of what the other side is doing.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor had no particular comment on this, but asked if, when Mr.
                <persName>Peterson</persName> referred to a real threat from fallout, he meant
              fallout occasioned by large-scale use of bombs in war. Mr.
                <persName>Peterson</persName> confirmed this, and the Chancellor observed that
              radioactive clouds would endanger all countries, whether or not they were involved
              directly in a war.</p>
            <p>This concluded the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes.</p>

            <p><persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Lewis Strauss</persName> opened the conversation by
              telling the Chancellor how glad he was to have the opportunity to discuss atomic
              energy matters with him. He mentioned the talks the United States had had with the
              three Wise Men of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> earlier this year and
              how that project promised to speed the atoms-for-peace program. He said that the short
              time the Chancellor had at his disposal would not permit any comprehensive coverage of
              the atomic energy field and suggested that the best way to proceed would be for the
              Chancellor to ask questions. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName>
              mentioned that Merrill Eisenbud, a distinguished member of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                >AEC</gloss> staff, would be available for a period in Bonn to develop in greater
              detail for the Chancellor any of the matters covered this morning. He also said that
              Dr. <persName>Bishop</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
              representative in Paris, could come to Bonn for consultation if the Chancellor so
              desired.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thanked Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> for his kind words and offer of expert advice
              and agreed that it would be best for him to ask questions at this meeting. He said
              that there were two recent events in Germany which had caused concern, First, the
              statement by eighteen well-known scientists warning against the harmful <pb n="292"
                xml:id="pg_292" facs="0320"/>radiation effects of tests and urging the German
              Government to set a model for the world by refusing to equip its forces with nuclear
              weapons. The Chancellor said he had discussed this matter with five of these
              scientists, led by Dr. <persName>Hahn</persName>. One would not expect to have
              scientists reverse themselves publicly—the best one could expect would be silence. The
              Chancellor said that he noted that there was great difference among scientists in
              their estimates of the risk of danger from nuclear testing. He had asked two German
              generals to join him with the five scientists to explain the military situation. The
              scientists had not previously thought through the military situation.</p>
            <p>The second episode had been the Albert Schweitzer appeal. The Chancellor said that
              Schweitzer’s prestige was very great in Germany—that he spoke almost with the
              authority of the Bible. Schweitzer’s statement that radioactive fallout from testing
              would harm the human race had caused great concern in Germany.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that some months ago a scientific committee had been set up to
              consider the radiation question and had come up with a conclusion differing from
              Schweitzer’s. Their results will be published after a few months’ delay so as to avoid
              any appearance of being intended as a rebuff to Schweitzer and the eighteen
              scientists. The Chancellor then asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> what results U.S. studies had come up with in regard to the
              possibility of harm from tests.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> first pointed out that
              Merrill Eisenbud of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> staff was an expert on
              radiation and would be able to fill in any details the Chancellor might want. He
              pointed out that there had been Soviet agitation against testing since the early days
              of the atomic energy program. Two and one-half years ago the National Academy of
              Science, an independent agency, had begun a study of the radiation question. It had
              reported that it found that even if testing continued at the same rate as at present,
              humans would only receive 1/100 roentgen over their normal reproductive lifetime; as
              opposed to this, they would receive seventy times as much radiation from normal
              background sources and from medical x-rays. The British Medical Research Council had
              reached similar conclusions; but the agitation against testing continues.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> stated that naturally the
              Albert Schweitzer statement had given us concern. We had found out that the Editor of
              the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review of Literature</hi> had gone to Schweitzer and
              persuaded him to make the statement after presenting to him the alleged scientific
              basis for the statement. Schweitzer was reluctant to make the statement, but agreed to
              do it on condition that it not be used to weaken free nations in the face of peril
              from the Soviet Union. On publication, the statement of this condition was omitted.
              The radioactivity of fish and plankton in the Columbia River was owing to
              Phosphorus–32 coming from the cooling water in the Hanford plants. <pb n="293"
                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0321"/>It is not a by-product of weapons testing and the
              figures concerned are not in point in discussing the Strontium–90 question. Admiral
                <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said that he felt Albert Schweitzer
              had been deceived unintentionally and that his scientific arguments were unsound.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> then pointed out that owing
              to the development of “clean” weapon design techniques, radioactive fallout could be
              greatly reduced. We had pursued this development for humanitarian and tactical
              purposes.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asked if we had made any
              attempt to contact Albert Schweitzer in an effort to get him to take back any
              erroneous parts of his statement. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> pointed out the fact that Dr. <persName>Libby</persName> had
              written a very respectful letter pointing to the errors in the Schweitzer document,
              but there had been no response. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> said that in view of the great response which the Schweitzer
              appeal had evoked in Germany, he wondered if it would not be possible to obtain a
              retraction from Schweitzer. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName>
              added that the Schweitzer statement had had a great effect also in the United States,
              that the reaction exceeded any previous intervention of this sort and that it might
              well be that we should send people to visit him.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> then asked about the
              problem of depositing of radioactive wastes from power reactors. He said that Prime
              Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> of the United Kingdom had
              told him that dumping radioactive wastes in the sea could have unforeseeable effects
              and therefore the U.K. intended to dispose of its wastes in coal mines. Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asked what could be done to handle
              this problem.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said that these wastes may
              become very valuable and therefore one must find a way to store them in a recoverable
              form. Certainly, one should not dump them into the sea promiscuously. Some of the
              fission products have half-lives of thousands of years. We are studying the
              interchange of the waters of the seas between depths and surface waters. We will study
              the ground burial problem, but even here great care must be taken to avoid seepage
              owing to porosity and to avoid contaminating underground streams. He concluded that
              waste disposal was a considerable problem but soluble.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor then asked if the U.K. had an H-bomb, admitting that this might be a
              difficult question to answer. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName>
              said “I believe so, but can’t say so categorically.” The Chancellor asked if nuclear
              tests are necessary for the development of weapons systems, and whether or not a
              one-year suspension of testing would do irreparable damage. Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said that he could answer the first part of
              this question in the affirmative without hesitation. The second part he could only
              answer with qualification. All <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>U.S. tests
              have specific purposes. For example, the current test series is directed at proving up
              small weapons to defend cities against aerial attack and to develop “cleaner” weapons.
              He said the second part of the question is tied into the disarmament negotiations and
              so very difficult to answer. In view of General Loper’s great experience with the
              testing matter and with disarmament, he asked him to answer this phase of the
              question. General Loper said that testing is a necessary part of any research and
              development cycle whether for a war item or a peace item. We know of no way to
              completely rid ourselves of atomic weapons, since one cannot determine scientifically
              that the other side had actually eliminated all their weapons. We assume that atomic
              weapons will be with us from now on. It is inevitable that improvements will come from
              weapons research without testing. There will be a lower degree of reliability, but
              even without testing, weapons will be improved. So what is gained by ceasing tests if
              such development continues anyway? We feel that the danger of testing is not so great
              as to warrant non-completion of the research and development cycle by testing. The
              United States is not an aggressive nation. We are interested in developing weapons for
              defense. This is a much more complex problem than development of weapons for offense,
              where the problem is merely to produce a fairly limited number of big weapons. We want
              to develop deliverable weapons for use against submarines, airplanes, intermediate
              range ballistic missiles, inter-continental ballistic missiles. We very desperately
              need defensive weapons.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asked if Congress would
              publish its report on the fallout hearings now in session. Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> said that he expects this report to be out
              before the end of this session of Congress. He also said that a new weapons effects
              handbook would be published by the Department of Defense late in June.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asked about the prospects
              for thermonuclear controlled reaction. He said that German scientists were predicting
              that something quite revolutionary was in the offing in this field. They referred to
              work being done at Columbia University. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> mentioned that Dr. <persName>Bishop</persName>, who was present
              at this meeting, had until recently been in charge of the controlled thermonuclear
              program in the United States. For five or six years, we have believed that it was
              theoretically possible to produce high enough temperatures—in millions of degrees—and
              contain the gases in closed spheres by the use of magnetic fields and cause the fusion
              of light elements. After we do this, we might produce large amounts of power without
              uranium. We have a very active program involving five laboratories in the United
              States. The U.K. and USSR are also pursuing this idea. It will be a number of years
              before it can be proved up in practice. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1"
                >Strauss</persName> added that we welcomed the <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"
                facs="0323"/>fact that German scientists were working in this field and said that we
              would be glad to exchange information with them. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> expressed his gratitude for this offer and asked if the price
              of uranium had not come down as a result of prospective advancements in controlled
              thermonuclear power. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> suggested
              that long before thermonuclear power was competitive, any existing uranium mines would
              be worked out.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thanked Admiral <persName
                corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> for the information developed during the
              meeting which he had found most instructive. He reverted to the great prestige of
              Albert Schweitzer and how important it would be to get him to admit inaccuracies in
              his statement. He felt that millions of people had developed fears as a result of the
              Schweitzer statement. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> thanked
              the Chancellor for his kind expressions. He said we had no present means of contacting
              Albert Schweitzer. We would have to develop some. We would study the Chancellor’s
              advice on this score with great care.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> then introduced Merrill
              Eisenbud to the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said he personally knew Schweitzer and was concerned that after his
              many years in the service of humanity this recent episode which had instead of
              relieving suffering instilled human fears, was most unfortunate. In order to keep
              Schweitzer’s memory pure, he thought it would be desirable to attempt to get him to
              clarify his statement.</p>

                      1956 Annual Review Questionnaire. In the Fall of 1956, the Federal Republic
                      announced that the goals for the number of men in uniform by the end of 1956
                      would be reduced from 96,000 to 70,000 and by the end of 1957 from 270,000 to
                      135,000. Government spokesmen stated that the goals for the period beyond 1957
                      would depend on the results of the current <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss> reappraisal of basic strategy.</p>
                    <p>Despite this element of uncertainty as to the eventual strength of the German
                      armed forces, slow but basic progress is being made in the military build-up.
                      During 1957, five understrength divisions with a limited combat capability are
                      scheduled to be assigned to <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. Two
                      additional divisions at regimental combat team strength are expected to be

                      A small naval command and two air transport squadrons also are to be turned

                      the conscription law enacted last July. Under present plans no more men will
                      be drafted this year; inductions will be resumed in the Spring of 1958 when
                      another 30,000 men will be drafted.</p></item>

                    agreement that there is no prospect of entering into successful negotiations
                    with the Soviets on German reunification in the near future. There was also
                    agreement that the proposals advanced by the Western Powers at Geneva remain
                    generally valid but that there was a need for increased public understanding of
                    the Western position. Further meetings of the Four-Power Working Group were held
                    in Bonn from May 13 to 18 and in Paris from June 18 to 22 to study methods of
                    presenting the Western position on reunification in positive terms designed to
                    convince Western—and particularly German—opinion that this position is
                    completely sound.</item>

                Republic’s defense contribution in terms of manpower, weapons and the mission of her
                forces is under searching review by the Federal Government. Doubts already existing
                within Germany as to whether the Germany military contribution was being properly
                organized or adapted to the requirements of the “atomic age” were strengthened by
                the British decision to withdraw part of their forces stationed in Germany and to
                place primary emphasis on strategic atomic weapons to deter attack against Great
                Britain and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. At the present time
                there appears to be a certain dichotomy in German thinking on this subject, with
                certain elements contending that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers,
                including Germany, should have large ground forces in Western Europe armed with
                conventional weapons and others maintaining that primary reliance should be placed
                on smaller units equipped with tactical atomic weapons. The Federal Republic has
                recognized that a unilateral solution of this question is not possible and, through
                the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, has raised the whole problem for
                consideration by the North Atlantic Council and <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1"
                  >SACEUR</gloss>. Substantial public opposition has developed in West Germany to
                arming German forces with atomic weapons or to stationing atomic weapons in the
                Federal Republic. Judging from informal statements, the German Minister of Defense,
                Franz Josef Strauss, is prepared to argue for a reduced German defense contribution
                in terms of man-power (from 500,000 to as low as 340,000) but with a combat
                capability equivalent to that <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0328"/>of the final

              <label>7.</label>
              <item><hi rend="italic">German Reunification.</hi> The desire for reunification and
                the problem of how to make progress toward this goal continue to represent
                fundamental motivating forces in Germany with regard to both external and internal
                policies. However, the importance of reunification as an issue in the context of the
                German election campaign has been reduced, partly as a result of the Chancellor’s
                skillful tactics in rebutting the charge that he is inflexible on this issue, and
                partly because of renewed evidence that the Soviet Union is unwilling to discuss the
                subject in realistic terms at this time. On the other hand, the Germans are devoting
                increasing attention to the relationship to the German reunification problem of the
                current disarmament negotiations in London and of the atomic armament issue. Certain
                anxiety persists that an agreement on disarmament may be reached among the Big
                Powers without parallel agreement on German reunification, which would eliminate an
                important bargaining point for achieving the latter objective. Although Soviet
                repression in Hungary dampened German hopes for reunification in the short run,
                Germans point to the revolutionary situation in Poland as holding forth promise of
                fundamental changes in the Soviet empire which could in due course alter the present
                negative attitude of the Soviets on the reunification issue.</item>

                elections to the next Bundestag on September 15, 1957 got well under way. Since the
                end of 1956, at which point the opposition <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
                (Social Democratic Party) had overtaken <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> (<persName
                  corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democratic Party) in public opinion polls,
                the popularity of the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> Government, and
                with it the confidence of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, have recovered
                steadily. This trend reflects: (a) public reaction to the developments in Hungary,
                which seemed to have confirmed Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName>’s policies based on the assumption of a continued Soviet
                threat, (b) the government’s achievements in the fields of internal prosperity and
                social welfare, and (c) the difficulties being experienced by the opposition parties
                in finding solid campaign issues. (At present, the Social Democrats are
                concentrating their attack on the government position regarding atomic weapons for
                the German armed forces and the storing of atomic weapons on German soil by other
                powers.) The election promises to be extremely close, and it is still doubtful that
                either the governing <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democrats or
                the opposition Social Democrats will win a majority of Bundestag seats in September.
                Coalition possibilities after the elections, in descending order of probability,
                are: (1) the continuation, with the help of several <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302"
                  facs="0330"/>of the smaller minor parties, of the present coalition dominated by
                the <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democrats; (2) a coalition of
                the <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democrats and the largest minor
                party, the Free Democrats; and (4) a so-called great coalition of the <persName
                  corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democrats and the Social Democrats. Of
                these various alternatives the third would give rise to the greatest likelihood of
                any considerable departure from the foreign and domestic policies which have been

                  exchange of goods for a period not to exceed three years; (2) it has no intention

            <p>Ambassador Krekeler, who called at his request, delivered to the Secretary a letter
              from the Foreign Minister thanking the Secretary for his message on the occasion of
              the Stinnes award. A copy of the letter is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">Not

            <p>Ambassador Krekeler then turned to the subject of German assets. Nothing had given
              him more trouble in the seven years of his service in the United States. Several years
              ago five Bundestag Deputies had formally complained to the Chancellor that the
              Ambassador was not sufficiently active in pressing the German case for return. This
              was the only time a complaint had ever been made against him.</p>
            <p>The coming election is of tremendous importance, he said. The Communists are making
              every effort to get the Federal Republic out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
              Everything is at stake. The situation is confused by the intense public feeling on the
              question of atomic weapons and by charges that the Chancellor has failed to reunite
              Germany. The Chancellor has made headway in recent speeches. However, his election may
              be jeopardized by failure to achieve a solution to the question of German assets. The
              issue is a very live one and any failure on the part of the Chancellor will be made a
              subject of partisan attacks. The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> would not be
              satisfied by a limited return up to $10,000. They have never accepted this solution in
              any way. Professor Baade, an <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> Deputy, has been one
              of the leading figures in the fight for full return. Therefore, they are in a good
              position to attack the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>On the basis of advice given him by Ambassador Krekeler, the Chancellor has said that
              the solution worked out should not be a burden on the American taxpayer and in his
              “good talks” with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> the Ambassador had
              sought to propose a solution based on that principle.</p>

            <p>The Secretary noted that any solution based on the proposals made by the Ambassador
              would require $100 million of new money. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                >Dillon</persName> was working on the figures to see whether this would be made
              unnecessary by a more modest return than that contemplated in the German
              proposals.</p>
            <p>The Secretary asked how the Germans viewed the ownership of General Aniline. The
              Ambassador replied that on the basis of clear instructions he was able to say that
              General Aniline was not German property and that there was no question of the Germans
              seeking a return of the value of this property. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> whether General Aniline was not included in the
              figures on which he was working. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
              replied that they were, but account had to be taken of this in any over-all
              settlement. Even if the Germans did not consider it their property the Swiss interest
              must be taken into account.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that a plan based on the German proposals had run into serious
              difficulties, particularly in view of the necessity for economy. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, however, was looking into the problem on the
              basis of figures to be provided by the Attorney General to ascertain whether it would
              be possible to return more than the $10,000 provided by the present Administration
              bill without use of $100 million of new money. He was not sure whether this would
              content the Germans.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador made reference to the figure of 97 percent used by the Secretary in
              his press conference yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">For the transcript of
                  <persName>Dulles</persName>’ news conference of July 16, see Department of State
                  <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> August 5, 1957, pp. 228–235.</note> as the
              percentage of claimants who would be satisfied by a $10,000 limited return. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that this figure had been given
              by the Attorney General only last week but that the figure we had used in public
              releases and in our presentations to Congress had been 90%. The Secretary recalled
              that the Attorney General had said something to the effect that if the amount of
              return were raised to some higher figure, perhaps, $20,000, the percentage would run
              well over 98%. The Ambassador thought that the 90% figure was the more correct one but
              it must be remembered that this did not include the shareholders in corporations, the
              American properties of which had been vested.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador had been asked to return to Germany and report to his Government on
              August 1, and hoped therefore that he could have a favorable report by July 30. The
              Secretary replied that every effort was being made to work out the solution promptly
              and that it was hoped that the necessary figures would be obtained from the Department
              of Justice today.</p>
            <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0333"/>
            <p>The Ambassador stated that although immediate Congressional action would of course be
              desirable, he recognized this was not possible this year. He was sure that Congress
              would approve any solution on which the Administration and the Germans agreed. He
              hoped there could be a very early announcement of such agreement. He would suggest
              this announcement make clear that hardship cases would receive prompt payment, but
              that other cases would take longer. This would make possible the use of the money
              flowing in over a period of time from German repayments on the settlement of its
              postwar debt. Thus, it would not be necessary to vote a $100 million new
              appropriation.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler stated that when he had thanked the Attorney General a few weeks
              ago for all the assistance that he had given him, the Attorney General urged that the
              Ambassador call on him when he had any problem. If the Secretary thought it desirable
              he would be willing to go to the Attorney General with the Secretary. The Secretary
              did not think that was advisable, but if the Ambassador wished to call personally on
              the Attorney General he saw no objection and the German Government might be pleased by
              this effort of the Ambassador.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler thought that any doubts the Attorney General might have arose out
              of the question of General Aniline. He repeated that his Government did not consider
              this a German corporation or a German interest that could come into German hands. It
              would be better if it were left out of any arrangement. The Secretary noted this would
              be difficult, as we consider General Aniline German property and, if any plan based on
              the German proposals was worked out, the value of General Aniline would have to be
              returned to the Swiss on the same basis as any on which compensation was given to
              German claimants.</p>

              <note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">CP 57–12/1, July 10, was entitled “Return of Vested
                German and Japanese Assets—Payment of War Claims of American Nationals.” The two
                supplements, dated July 23, were entitled “Précis of the Recommendations of Cabinet
                Paper 57–12/1” and “Statement from the Department of Justice of Cash and
                Unliquidated Assets Less Reserves for Claims and Litigation as of June 30, 1957.”
                  (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note>—In presenting the State Department
              recommendations as set forth in the Cabinet paper, Sec. <persName>Dulles</persName>
              emphasized how the whole principle of sanctity of private property in time of war was
              involved. He also noted how it would be helpful to our relationships with Germany if,
              assuming the action will sometime be accomplished, something could be done about it
              within the month. He pointed out that Treasury did not favor the action because of the
              charge that would be made against the closely balanced budget and the difficult debt
              situation. In response to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, he
              stated that action must of course wait upon legislation but that an Administration
              statement of intent would serve the cause.</p>
            <p>The President, after noting Sen. Smathers’ correspondence in opposition to such a
              proposal, suggested that the action contain a proviso which would limit the amounts
              that could be paid for lawyers’ fees such as the proviso that governed similar
              activity after World War II.</p>
            <p>Acting Attorney General Rogers stated Justice’s belief that the Administration ought
              not to make any change in the position taken last April for return of vested German
              assets up to a limit of $10,000. If action should be taken, he hoped that a rash of
              court actions could be avoided by transferring to the German Government the
              responsibility of adjudicating and paying specific claims.</p>
            <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> spoke against the proposal on
              the basis that Germany was not poverty-stricken and that the United States would lose
              more than it would gain from an expansion of the program. Sec.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> replied with emphasis on the value to the United States
              to be considered as a country where it is safe to have private property.</p>
            <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and Mr.
                <persName>Brundage</persName> urged that any action to be taken be based on a
              separate appropriation rather than on a diversion of funds from <gloss
                target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> payments.</p>
            <p>The President ascertained the procedure that would be followed in carrying out
              payments and the extent to which “instructions” pertaining to German payments would be
              appropriate. Then he expressed his belief that the Administration ought to submit this
              proposal to the Congress as the only solution the Administration could find for a very
              vexing problem. He did not wish the United States to violate its traditional devotion
              to the sanctity of private property. <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0335"/>After
              further discussion, he repeated his belief that the proposal should be submitted to
              Congress.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that State would develop a statement in coordination with Justice for
              early release, and that Justice would be responsible for the legislation. It was
              further agreed that the matter would be taken up with the Leadership prior to any
              release. The Secretary urged that every effort be made to avoid any leakage of the
              proposed action. At this reference to leaks, the President asked whether any Cabinet
              members would object if he called in <persName>J. Edgar Hoover</persName> to look at
              some of these leaks which he found very exasperating. He cited a recent experience
              pertaining to a private query of his about certain provisions of the Cordiner report,
              a query which was recounted in the press very promptly. Sec.
                <persName>Dulles</persName> thought that such a request to the FBI would itself
              become known and cause great furor. The President, after stating his belief that Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> at least ought to be able to operate
              without publicity, commented that he heard no objections and felt free to go
              ahead.</p>

              to following combination of factors:<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">On September 15, in

                absolute majority of 270 of the 497 Bundestag seats.</note>
              <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> clearly dominated campaign, and his
              prestige and popularity gave <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> great advantage over
              opposition with colorless leader; prevailing prosperity so great that inclination to

              maximum security and most favorable position obtainable under present world
              conditions.</p>
            <p>No single issue can be isolated as determining election outcome. Most important for
              many voters was extent of present prosperity; increased support for <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> in industrialized Ruhr perhaps best evidence that
              disinclination to risk upsetting present well-being outweighed traditional appeal of
                <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> as workers party.</p>
            <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>
            <p>Chancellor’s constant exploitation of fear that <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
              policy on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would jeopardize German security
              undoubtedly convinced some voters that <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> program
              dangerous. Repeated overtures on behalf <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> by
              Communists in USSR and East Zone strengthened this impression in German public, which
              basically suspicious of and hostile to Communism. Furthermore, continued Soviet
              intransigence on reunification and general hard line in world affairs made <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> advocacy of new approach to USSR seem unrealistic if
              not dangerous.</p>
            <p>Despite <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> promises to abolish conscription, defense
              policy was not decisive issue, with rearmament and compulsory service now taken for
              granted. <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> exploitation of fear of atomic bombs and
              campaigning against atomic weapons for German army won few new voters but failed

            <p>High level participation again favored <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>, which
              expanded beyond its 1953 base to capture lion’s share of 5 million Germans voting for
              first time as well as number of former supporters of smaller parties.</p>
            <p><gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> losses were penalty for opportunism and refusal
              to take clear position on coalition intentions which, together with willingness

                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, cost substantial bourgeois support. Fact that <gloss
                target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> won even 7.7 percent attributable in part to reluctance
              among many voters to see any one party become too strong. Losses of <gloss
                target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> constitute blow to prestige of “young Turk” leadership
              in Duesseldorf.</p>

              present appeal in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and its supporters remain
              confined to lunatic fringe.</p>
            <p>Most important result of election is firm mandate it gives to Chancellor, especially
              in foreign policy where he has free hand and Parliamentary strength to continue with
              past policies, especially on intimate alliance with West.</p>
            <p>While size of victory certainly due in part to <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName>’s stature, welcome feature of campaign for long pull was <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> emphasis on team of men around Chancellor, and we
              believe any inclination by journalists to interpret results primarily as proof of
              penchant for authoritarian leadership would be exaggerated. Democratic processes were
              fully operative. Campaign for most part was fought fairly and public decided it
              preferred status quo to risk of uncertain changes.</p>
            <p><gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> failure to break <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                >CDU</gloss> hold came as no surprise to opposition leadership, which had been
              reconciled to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s continuation in office.
                <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> will probably be subjected to internal stresses
              with Ollenhauer’s uninspiring leadership getting much of blame. Wehner will probably
              claim good showing in Hamburg calls for acceptance <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309"
                facs="0337"/>of his more radical approach as standard party program. This effort
              will be hotly contested by right wing under Fritz Erler who will use extent of <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> victory to prove German public wants moderate policies.
              As first tentative estimate, we believe on balance <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>
              will not be radicalized as result of expected power struggle.</p>

                Central Files, 762A.13/10–557)</note> He said he was aware of the fact that Mr.
                <persName>Burgess</persName> was opposed to the idea. However, he was inclined to
              feel that Mr. <persName>Bruce</persName>’s ideas should prevail in this particular
              matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that he had originally been sympathetic to the
              idea, but in the light of considerations which had been brought to his attention by
              Mr. <persName>Southard</persName>, he had changed his mind. He said that Dr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName> had made a speech in August in which he had said that he
              thought the Deutschemark could be revalued upward if similar action were taken with
              regard to the dollar. This had caused great speculative activity, which had brought
              great pressure on the pound. A week later the German Government had issued a statement
              that it did not intend to revalue the Deutschemark. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
              remarked that business interests in Germany did not agree with Dr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName>’s <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0338"/>views. He
              thought there was also disagreement in the Government and Central Bank and suggested
              that Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName> was not in a position to speak for the German
              Government.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that it would be impossible to have Dr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName> come to the United States without causing new
              speculation which would cause great difficulty for the British. Furthermore, it was
              difficult to see what could usefully be accomplished until there was a clearer idea of
              what the developments were likely to be in France. Mr. <persName>Southard</persName>
              laid great emphasis on the difficulty which the British were encountering in
              maintaining the position of the pound. He said that following the British and German
              statements at the recent meeting of the International Monetary Fund, an improvement
              had taken place in the British position. It is essential that nothing be done to
              disturb the atmosphere. Mr. <persName>Southard</persName> said that Dr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName> was incapable of remaining silent on the subject of
              exchange rates and apparently did not realize the damage which was done by his
              statements. He calculated that Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName>’s public statements had
              cost the British Government a half-billion dollars of their reserves, pointing out
              that this had in turn caused problems for the United States.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName> is the second strongest man
              in the German Government, and may well be the next Chancellor of the Federal Republic.
              He said that Germany is the strongest country in Europe from an economic viewpoint and
              it is desirable that the Federal Republic share some of the financial burdens which
              are being carried by the United States. The Secretary mentioned in particular
              assistance to underdeveloped areas. He expressed concern over the idea that it was
              impossible to arrange a discussion with Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName> with a view to
              obtaining the assistance of the German Government. He asked whether it would not be
              possible to have Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName> reaffirm, before coming to the United
              States, the position of the Federal Government that no change should be made in the
              exchange value of the <persName corresp="#p_MDE1">Mark</persName>. Mr.
                <persName>Anderson</persName> said that too frequent reaffirmations of the position
              would also be bad and that the best thing to do was to be silent.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that it would seem that for the indefinite future it would be
              impossible for us to talk to Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName>. He did not think this
              was feasible from a political viewpoint. He had no strong views as to the timing of a
              visit by Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName>, but he thought it should be possible to work
              out some arrangement under which Dr. <persName>Erhard</persName> could be brought to
              the United States without raising these difficulties. If Dr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName> had ideas which we did not like, it was all the more
              important that we should talk to him, since he might well become Chancellor of the
              Federal Republic in the not too distant future.</p>
            <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0339"/>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that he would be willing to have Dr.
                <persName>Erhard</persName> come to the United States in the light of the
              considerations which the Secretary had mentioned, provided that some way could be
              found of dealing with the problem of speculation over exchange rates. He suggested
              that we should inform the British of our intentions in advance.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that a message to Ambassador Bruce would be worked out on this

            <p>Ambassador Krekeler called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
              following his return to Washington from extended leave. The following subjects were
              discussed.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Call on the Secretary of State</hi></p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Krekeler</persName> said he had not seen Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> since the elections. He had had an extended
              discussion with Foreign Minister Von Brentano. Dr. <persName>Von Brentano</persName>
              had asked him to see the Secretary of State as soon as possible and to seek Mr.
                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ views on the question of German relations with Eastern
              European countries. Ambassador Krekeler said that apart from the question of German
              relations with Yugoslavia, the German Federal Government was still confronted with the
              question of what it should do about Poland in particular, and possibly other Eastern
              European countries. He said that no decisions on this subject had been reached as yet.
              From the German viewpoint, the problem had two aspects. One was what the Germans could
              get out of the establishment of relations. The other was what the chances were of an
              evolutionary development in Eastern Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">German Force Build-Up</hi></p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler said that the German military authorities were very pleased with
              the results of the recent maneuvers. They were particularly satisfied with the
              performance of the conscripts. In fact, he had received one report that the conscripts
              had turned out better than the volunteers. The Ambassador indicated that his
              information had come directly from the military and that he had not seen Defense
              Minister <persName corresp="#p_SALL1">Strauss</persName> prior to leaving Bonn. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked how the build-up of German
              forces was progressing. Ambassador Krekeler was unable to provide any specific details
              but stated that the program for the next fiscal year would be fulfilled. He remarked
              that it was important to go forward carefully, indicating that the Iller River
              incident had caused some feeling about pressing the build-up too rapidly.</p>

            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked whether Ambassador Krekeler
              had any information as to Herr Strauss’ plans for visiting Washington. Ambassador
              Krekeler said he had no specific information on this subject. He doubted, however,
              whether it would be possible for the Defense Minister to come during the current
              calendar year due to the need for the Germans to get their build-up plans to <gloss

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Support Costs</hi></p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if there were any new
              developments on support costs and if the Ambassador had had any discussions on it in
              Bonn. The Ambassador said he knew of nothing new. He remarked that the United States
              had reserved the right to raise the matter again during the latter part of this year.
              Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Reinstein</persName> pointed out that the agreements
              which had been concluded in June<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">See <ref target="#d126"
                  >Document 126</ref>.</note> had not yet been <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313"
                facs="0341"/>ratified by the Bundestag. Ambassador Krekeler said he had been unaware
              of this fact.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Break in German Diplomatic Relations with
                Yugoslavia</hi></p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the Yugoslav Ambassador
              had called on him on the previous day to protest the attitude of the United States
              Government with regard to this matter. The Ambassador had also taken the position that
              the Federal Republic had no right under international law to break off relations with
              Yugoslavia, suggesting that such a step was appropriate only as a preliminary to going
              to war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he had pointed out to
              the Ambassador that the United States Government had in a friendly way pointed out to
              the Yugoslav Government before they recognized the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              the difficulties which would be certain to arise if such a step were taken. We also
              pointed out to the Yugoslavs that the German Government had made its position on the
              subject very clear and that the only exception which it recognized was the Soviet
              Union. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> had alleged in response
              that the German Government followed a different policy in dealing with large powers
              and in dealing with small powers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
              had pointed out to him that the German Government had made an exception in the case of
              the Soviet Union because of the fact that it was an occupying power. In addition, it
              had the difficult problem with regard to the repatriation of German nationals in the
              Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he had made
              it clear to the Yugoslav Ambassador that he knew the German Government deplored the
              fact that it had had to take the step of breaking off relations with Yugoslavia, as we
              did, although we found the German position entirely understandable. The Yugoslav
              Ambassador had claimed that pressure was being exerted on the Yugoslav Government and
              that the Yugoslav Government could not have its policy dictated from the outside. The
              Ambassador had even said that this constituted an intervention in Yugoslav internal
              affairs.. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he had told the
              Ambassador that he could not follow this reasoning. On the other hand, the recognition
              of the Soviet Zone regime did constitute an action by the Yugoslav Government
              involving German internal matters.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked Ambassador Krekeler whether
              he had had an opportunity to discuss this matter when he was in Bonn. The Ambassador
              said that he had seen Foreign Minister Von Brentano before the Yugoslav action had
              been taken. He stated that it was his personal view that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Marshal Tito</persName> had been frightened by the events in Hungary. He was
              concerned that the liberalization process would get out of hand and undermine his own
              position. He thought that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had been driven
              for essentially internal reasons toward rapprochement with the Soviet Union. He
              doubted very much whether the <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0342"/>Yugoslavs had
              gotten anything in exchange for their action in recognizing the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler said that the Yugoslav recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> was only one symptom of a change in the Yugoslav position which he was
              inclined to feel was now somewhat like that of the Chinese. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said there was a danger that the trend in
              Yugoslav policy might go farther than the Yugoslavs actually wanted. He thought we
              should be careful not to push the Yugoslavs into the Soviet Bloc. Ambassador Krekeler
              said that he felt part of the explanation of the Yugoslav position was the attitude
              toward <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He thought <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was anxious to help <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> maintain his position. The Ambassador expressed some
              skepticism regarding the degree of Yugoslav understanding of the requirements for
              reaching a European settlement. He said he thought it was of some significance that
              the Yugoslavs had consistently taken a position against European integration, not only
              for themselves but for the other countries involved. They had frequently warned the
              Germans against becoming involved in Western European arrangements.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he was not clear why the
              Yugoslavs had chosen this particular time to take the action. He had asked the
              Yugoslavs about this both before and after the action had been taken, but they had
              been unable to give any answers. The Ambassador had said to him the previous day that
              the Yugoslavs always felt this was the right thing to do, and that Yugoslavia was much
              like a man about to dive into a swimming pool. At some point he dives.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Krekeler remarked that if the Yugoslavs had really been interested in
              establishment of German relations with Poland, it was difficult to see why they had
              recognized the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, since this was not helpful in
              terms of the development of German relations with Eastern Europe. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said this point had been made to the Yugoslavs
              at the German request prior to their taking action. Ambassador Krekeler said that one
              thing which struck him about the Yugoslav action was that the Yugoslavs had not
              discussed the problem as they saw it with the Germans beforehand and merely pronounced
              their intention to the German Government. He pointed out that Foreign Minister Von
              Brentano had made a particular point of this in his press conference on October 21.
              (Ambassador Krekeler gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> the
              Foreign Office version of the Brentano press conference, which will be translated and
              distributed separately.)<note n="5" xml:id="d132fn5">Not found attached to the source
                text.</note></p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked what the Federal Government
              now intended to do. Was it contemplated that a trade mission would be maintained in
              Yugoslavia? Ambassador Krekeler said that he did not think so. The Germans had asked
              the French to represent them in Belgrade. <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0343"/>He
              said that they would not violate the undertakings which they had given Yugoslavia in
              their trade and payments agreements, indicating that he had in mind specifically the
              credit given to Yugoslavia by the German Government in recognition of Yugoslav war
              claims. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that he thought
              the German action in asking the French to represent their interests in Yugoslavia had
              been a wise one and reflected the very good state of relations between France and
              Germany.</p>

                >Adenauer</persName> has been confirmed in power for another four years. Even in the
              event of his death or retirement, his party, the <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                >CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>, could be expected to maintain its
              position as the dominant force in West German politics during that period.</p>
            <p>The question as to who might succeed him, if he should relinquish his office, remains
              unanswered. It has frequently been posed. On one occasion, he is said to have
              responded: “Look at Churchill. He had designated <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                >Eden</persName> as his heir apparent; I shall not make a similar mistake.”</p>
            <p>It is to be anticipated and hoped that the United States will, for a considerable
              span of time, be dealing with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, who will
              control a majority in the West German parliament. If the “old fox” remains on the
              scene we can make assumptions that might well be unwarranted in case of his removal
              from it.</p>
            <p>The recent <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> campaign was characterized
              by a frank and repeated avowal of his loyalty to American foreign policy. The
              assertions of independence of the United States, of suspicion of its motives and
              intentions, so clearly manifested in certain other European countries, evoked no
              imitation in the Federal Republic. The Chancellor was constant in his theme: namely,
              that there are two great power complexes in the world, the USSR and the USA. Germany,
              a second, or even third rate power, must make its choice between the two, and its
              selection must be alliance, friendship and fidelity to the USA and an unswerving
              adherence to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance. In private, <pb
                n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0344"/>he expressed the opinion that the United States
              should exercise greater leadership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and cease
              to be so tender about the national susceptibilities of other members.</p>
            <p>In short, while <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> continues in
              authority, and directs his almost authoritarian prerogatives to the ends in which he
              sincerely believes, it is probable that occasions will seldom arise likely to
              precipitate a marked division of interest or objective between our two countries. Even
              if there should occur clashes of temperament or opinion, they should be capable of sub
              rosa settlement.</p>
            <p>The position occupied by the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in Europe,
              geographically, economically and financially, together with its as yet unrealized
              military potential, would be disturbing if one entertained doubts as to <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s future attitudes toward foreign policy. These
              will be determined, I believe, by his estimate of the wisdom with which he thinks
              American foreign policy is being conducted. He must be fully sensible of the peculiar
              and favorable posture of his own country, and how a tempting oscillation between East
              and West might contribute to its superficial benefit.</p>
            <p>No such hesitation, however, as far as one can presently speculate, has been
              cherished by him (though it may have entered into his calculations). Moreover, despite
              its startling achievements in other fields, the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1"
                >FedRep</gloss> has not yet regained its prestige in political affairs. Its
              governors are ambitious to serve as mediators, or as second best to influence the play
              of events in the Middle East, as well as in Africa. Freed of the erstwhile taint of
              colonialism, no longer possessors of territories, their brutal management of dependent
              peoples almost forgotten, they toy with the pleasing idea that they are less suspect
              in the Arab and African countries than are other nations still exercising suzerainty
              in those murky localities.</p>
            <p>Torn by a feeling of guilt toward the Jews, to whom they are in course of making
              periodic financial atonement, they have not yet decided whether to accord diplomatic
              recognition to Israel, or to rationalize their refusal to do so by asserting the
              greater usefulness of their role as impartial and uncommitted observers of regrettable
              national rivalries.</p>
            <p>In relation to the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe, their future course of action
              is also not resolved. Intrigued by the possibilities inherent in the Polish situation,
              and, in lesser degree, elsewhere, much study has been pursued by them as to how best
              they might maneuver to their own and allied advantage by an increase in their trade,
              and more formal relationships in that area. The recent recognition by Yugoslavia of
              the so-called East German Republic and the swift Federal Republic riposte to this
              action has postponed whatever plans were being evolved by <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> and his counselors in this connection. Nevertheless, it may be
              expected that a resumption of attention <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>to
              such relationships will again be brought under advisement. The historical trend of
              preoccupation with Turkey and lands farther east has begun to reassert itself.
              Delegations of responsible Germans have begun to investigate commercial opportunities,
              especially in Turkey and Iran, and their government can be expected to support, with
              ample credits, undertakings of a nature which might promise ultimate advantages to its
              citizens.</p>
            <p>Everywhere, the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> is expanding its thrust
              outward, taking moderate but adventurous risks. Its preferred partner in these fields
              would be the United States. I believe we should have intimate conversations at an
              early date with German administrators to ascertain whether a combination in some
              places of our outlays might not be of mutual benefit, and likely to advance our
              political objectives. In the domain of economic aid, consultation, and possibly joint
              action, with the Germans might multiply the effectiveness of our present programs. In
              conjunction with them and other allies, we might enter into arrangements with rich
              native governments, such as those of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran to sponsor
              and participate in area development schemes, instead of bearing alone the burden of
              supplying manpower and funds for such purposes, with little assurance our efforts will
              be rewarded even by so evanescent a tribute as short-lived gratitude.</p>
            <p>It would be idle to dwell on the possibilities of fruitful cooperation between the
              Germans and ourselves if the result would be to weaken our indispensable ties with
              older and more proven allies. But such would not be the case, if we could arrive at an
              understanding with Germany, prosperous of [<hi rend="italic">to</hi>?] our associates,
              subject to the multilateral endorsement and participation of others. It seems to me
              unwise to await longer a concerted movement, of which there are no apparent signs,
              conducive to a broadening of Western influence in the satellite and other worlds, when
              a commencement to that end might be made in partnership with the only friendly nation
              now [able?] to afford like ourselves a venture of this scope.</p>
            <p>There is much talk of “grand designs” and careless paternity of other resounding
              phrases. But while <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is still alive and
              active, should we not search out his designs, if any? To do so would not be difficult,
              for the Germans are not the least vocal of peoples. They labor under a subdued sense
              of guilt, and will not be the first to extend an invitation. Their dynamism is
              extraordinary, but it has been chiefly devoted to an animation of their domestic
              concerns. I think it can be harnessed to broader uses, consonant with US aims. I shall
              not in this telegram suggest how this might be done, but call your attention to an
              imperfectly utilized source of strength and <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0346"

              <item>As a result of the decisive victory of the <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                  >Adenauer</persName> government in recent elections, the prospects are good for
                the continuance in West Germany of a moderate stable government allied with the
                West. Its current economic health as well as political stability could be threatened
                both by crises generated by internal circumstances and by developments outside West
                Germany’s control, e.g. a major recession in the West, or a major decline in the
                strength and cohesion of <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0347"/><gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We believe that, barring such external
                developments, serious internal divisions and extremism are highly unlikely.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>The rate of economic expansion will probably slow down primarily as the result
                of an increasingly tight labor situation. Some price rises also appear likely.
                However, serious economic strains appear very improbable unless caused by a major
                recession in the West.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>The Soviet leaders have again slammed the door on reunification. They have no
                intention of permitting the anti-Soviet population of East Germany to be added to
                that of West Germany on terms which would enable a unified Germany to join with the
                West. Moreover, they want to continue their occupation of East Germany in order to
                protect their position in Eastern Europe, to apply a vise on Poland, and to retain
                the advantages of the advanced deployment of powerful military forces.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Similarly the USSR is not likely to weaken its hold on Berlin and, in
                conjunction with the East German regime, will probably apply increased pressures on
                the Allied position. A widespread East German revolt seems unlikely in the next few
                years, although spontaneous outbreaks are always possible, particularly if there
                were uprisings elsewhere in the Satellite area.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>So long as this situation continues, the West Germans seem likely to remain in
                  <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. They also believe that they must rearm in
                order to assure their national security, either as a part of <gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or, if need be, independently. Nevertheless,
                rearmament progress will probably continue to be hampered by doubts concerning the
                basic strategic concepts upon which forces and weapons systems should be built, and
                by a lack of popular enthusiasm to accept the costs and sacrifices involved. We
                believe the West Germans are unlikely to consider withdrawing from <gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and assuming a posture of armed neutrality unless
                the alliance became greatly weakened or unless the USSR made an acceptable
                reunification offer. In the event the USSR reassessed its position and offered new
                terms for reunification, the West Germans would not accept them if there were
                clearly a risk of their becoming a Soviet satellite; on the other hand, they
                probably would accept something less than they or their Western allies now consider
                essential.</item>

              <item>One very important factor underlying the high degree of current political
                stability in West Germany has been its remarkable progress in economic development
                and international trade. Starting with a heavily damaged industrial base and a very
                low standard of living, West Germany is now enjoying considerable prosperity and has
                a sound financial position. This economic progress has absorbed the major energies
                of the West Germans, has contributed to the weakening of formerly rigid class
                distinctions, and has greatly enhanced the acceptance of the policies of the
                  <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> government. The <gloss
                  target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>’s overwhelming victory in the recent election was
                probably more an endorsement of German prosperity than a measured approval of the
                specific policies which accompanied it.</item>
              <label>18.</label>
              <item>Both domestically and in foreign trade the West German economic situation in
                1956 and early 1957 was exceedingly favorable. The West German gross national
                product, in terms of purchasing power equivalents, is now about as large as that of
                the UK, $74.4 billion compared with the UK’s $75.6 billion, and considerably larger
                that France’s almost $60 billion.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">Estimate for 1956 on
                  the basis of 1955 US prices. Figure for West Germany adjusted to include West
                  Berlin. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> By 1960, when the Saar is scheduled
                to return to the German economic area, West Germany’s total <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                  >GNP</gloss> will probably exceed that of the UK. West Germany’s per capita
                consumption in 1956 was slightly lower than that of France and about 10 percent
                below that of the UK, but it was substantially improved over earlier years. The
                rapid recovery of West Germany is due to the fact that it invested a significantly
                higher proportion of its national product than did other West European states.
                Moreover, while France and the UK struggled with internal inflation and foreign
                payments problems, West German prices increased only slightly and an export boom was
                piling up large foreign exchange reserves, which had reached $5.5 billion by August
                1957, about 70 percent of it in gold and dollars. However, West Germany’s relative
                position in Western Europe still falls short of the position of pre-war Germany,
                both in over-all production and in per capita production and consumption.</item>
              <label>19.</label>
              <item>The recently accelerating trend in the West German surplus to an annual rate of
                almost $1 billion in the first half of 1957, has been due primarily to expanding
                demand and inflation in the rest of Western Europe.<note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4">A

                devaluation and more stringent credit restrictions in the UK. In any case the West
                German government will almost certainly maintain its refusal to appreciate the
                Deutsche <persName corresp="#p_MDE1">Mark</persName>. Its approach rather is to
                liberalize import duties, to advance the schedule for payment of foreign debt
                obligations and arms purchases, to make increased restitution payments, and to
                provide for some export of capital. If these measures plus some anticipated
                inflation in West Germany fail to correct the imbalance, the Federal Republic hopes
                that other countries will make the necessary adjustments. If they do not, West
                Germany will be under increasing pressure to appreciate the Deutsche <persName
                  corresp="#p_MDE1">Mark</persName>, relax credit restrictions, and lend more
                extensively abroad, or suffer trade discrimination.</item>
              <label>20.</label>
              <item>Long-term private capital investment abroad by West Germans is developing
                slowly. In the year ending June 30, 1957, it amounted to $118 million, mostly in the
                Western Hemisphere. Private lending in the Middle East and South Asia has consisted
                mainly of medium-term credits to facilitate the sale of capital equipment and
                construction goods. West German exports to these latter areas have been expanding
                steadily for a total of $650 million in 1956, or about 9 percent of all West German

                  target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> for a total of $175 million, and this may indicate
                that further government loans abroad will be made. West Germany is committed to
                provide $200 million during 1958–62 for the development of the overseas territories
                of its Common Market partners and may undertake loans to the European Payments Union
                and to France.</item>

              <item>There are indications that the rate of economic expansion in West Germany may be
                slowing down. Some decline was to be expected as the backlog of reconstruction needs
                was met and the labor situation became tighter. In 1956 real <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                  >GNP</gloss> and industrial production increased 6.4 and 8 percent respectively,
                as compared with gains of 11.2 and 14 percent in 1955. However, in early 1957 West
                German economic growth accelerated somewhat, as it did in the rest of Western
                Europe. In large measure, the level of West German economic activity is dependent on
                conditions in other Western countries, since West German exports total over 30
                percent of its industrial production. The continuing growth of the West German
                economy even at somewhat reduced rates has been due largely to the rising level of
                its exports.</item>
              <label>22.</label>
              <item>In part the declining rate of growth has been in response to the West German
                policy of maintaining a tight monetary and financial brake on the economy in order
                to control inflationary pressures resulting from an already tight labor market.
                Gross fixed capital investment reached a peak of 23 percent of <gloss
                  target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> in 1956, but fell off significantly in the first half
                of 1957. Authorizations for both industrial <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0350"
                />and residential construction have declined. The recent reduction in the bank rate
                was an attempt partially to offset this trend.</item>

              <item>Under the best of circumstances West Germany will encounter greater obstacles to
                future economic growth. Fully 50 percent of the total population is now employed or
                self-employed—a higher proportion than in any other Western industrial country. The
                labor force will grow more slowly during the next five years. Due mainly to low
                wartime birth rates, annual net accretion to the labor force will decline from the
                current rate of 700,000 to about 400,000 by 1962. Moreover, the average number of
                hours worked in manufacturing and building has fallen from 47.7 in early 1955 to
                46.7 hours per week in early 1957. Further reductions are likely as the result of
                already negotiated and pending trade union contracts.</item>

              <item>West Germany will increasingly encounter some of the inflationary pressures
                which have bedeviled its Western neighbors. The tight labor market and somewhat more
                limited opportunities for productivity increases raised West Germany wage costs by 5
                percent in 1956; greater restlessness on the part of trade unions indicates that
                this trend is likely to continue. Recently several large trade unions, including
                those of the metal workers, have announced their intention to seek higher wages,
                shorter hours, and greater fringe benefits. Coal prices have been raised by 8
                percent since the election and other basic industries may seek to follow suit. In
                contrast to substantial surpluses in recent years, the federal budget is expected to
                be in deficit by over $1 billion in the year ending March 31, 1958, as a result of
                growing defense and social security expenditures. These and other factors point to
                the likelihood of rising wage costs and an accelerated rise in consumer
                prices.</item>

              <item>Whatever may be the long-term Soviet objective in Germany, it is obvious that
                during the past year, the Soviet leaders have again slammed the door on
                reunification and locked and bolted it. If for no other reason than to protect its
                position in Eastern Europe, the USSR believes that it cannot now afford to give up
                its control and <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0351"/>occupation of East Germany.
                Over the longer term, perhaps the Soviet leaders have some hope that events will so
                progress as to give them an opportunity to bring about West Germany’s withdrawal
                from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and heighten responsiveness to Soviet
                pressures. They will probably continue to show interest in negotiating with the
                Federal government on matters of common concern, particularly trade, and at the same
                time probe for weaknesses on larger issues. At the moment the Soviet leaders almost
                certainly are not giving any thought to permitting the deeply anti-Soviet population
                of East Germany to be added to that of West Germany on any terms acceptable to the
                West Germans.</item>
              <label>31.</label>
              <item>Retention of control over East Germany has practical advantages for the USSR,
                aside from that of denying it to the West, including (a) the application of a vise
                on Poland through the powerful Soviet military forces stationed in East Germany, (b)
                the advance positioning of Soviet forces against <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss>, and (c) the possibility of exerting continuous political pressure
                on the Federal Republic through holding 18,000,000 Germans hostage. While the USSR
                is taking a smaller percentage of East German <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>,
                it still derives a considerable economic advantage from its position. In addition,
                the importance of East German uranium must be considered. We believe these
                advantages outweigh in Soviet eyes the adverse effect of holding down a deeply
                anti-Communist, anti-Soviet population through a regime devoid of popular
                support.</item>
              <label>32.</label>
              <item>We believe that the USSR will continue to oppose any scheme for German
                unification which does not create conditions in central Europe at least as favorable
                to the Soviet position as those which now obtain through the occupation of Eastern
                Germany. It seems unlikely, in particular, that the USSR will be genuinely
                interested in proposals for reunification on the basis of a neutralization of
                Germany alone. The USSR is probably convinced that the prospect of a neutralized
                Germany is illusory, that a formally neutral Germany would sooner or later side with
                the West. The USSR will almost certainly continue to insist on direct negotiations
                between East Germany and the Federal Republic as a pretext for avoiding serious
                discussion. The USSR will seize every opportunity to enhance the position and
                prestige of the East German regime. At the same time the USSR will take all
                measures, including the suppression by force of popular movements, to maintain the
                security of its position in East Germany.</item>
              <label>33.</label>
              <item>Similarly the USSR will probably not weaken its present hold on Berlin, although
                it will probably continue to turn over additional responsibilities to the East
                German regime. Pressures on West Berlin are almost certain to continue in order to
                test Western vigilance and resolution, to maintain a security check on allied
                movements, <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"/>and to erode the Western
                position. As more authority is transferred to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                  >GDR</gloss>, the harassments of Western communications are likely to be stepped
                up in an attempt to force West Germany and the Western powers to deal with the East
                German regime. The ousting of the Western Allies will remain a major Soviet
                objective. To achieve this objective the Kremlin might take harsh action against
                Berlin if: (a) Western political, psychological, and military strengths eroded
                sufficiently to encourage Moscow to believe that Western responses would lack
                unanimity and decisiveness, or (b) the Soviets became convinced that more vigorous
                actions against West Berlin would divert Western strengths from other areas of
                critical importance to the Bloc.</item>

              <item>The overwhelming majority of East Germans regard the regime of the zonal
                Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss>) as alien in its subservience
                to Soviet interests and have not accepted the “German Democratic Republic” as a
                separate national entity. Their overriding political aspiration is for reunification
                and the elimination of Soviet control. Faced with almost universal hatred and
                contempt, the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> regime has been forced to resort
                to many techniques for repressing and diverting open hostility, and it has had to
                forego any change which might be interpreted as a confession of weakness. Hence, the
                processes of de-Stalinization in other areas of the Bloc have not led to any changes
                in the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> leadership. Walter Ulbricht, the leader
                of the party, has remained fanatically loyal to Moscow and his position and
                repressive policies have been strengthened by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                  >Khrushchev</persName>’s unqualified public endorsement. Stability in East Germany
                rests heavily on the presence of Soviet troops and the belief of the populace that
                these troops would be decisively employed against any attempt to change the
                political situation by force.</item>
              <label>35.</label>
              <item>Contributing to the basic political discontent is the low standard of living,
                which we estimate to be less than 75 percent that of West Germany. The people are
                aware that these conditions are due both to Soviet exploitation and indigenous
                Communist mismanagement. The Communists have attempted to alleviate economic
                grievances as one means of avoiding a popular revolt in this highly sensitive area.
                In order to assist the East German government to maintain economic growth and to
                provide some concessions to German consumers, the USSR has reduced its exploitation
                considerably and is providing goods and foreign exchange to the zone on a loan
                basis. The result has been some improvement in living standards and a reduction in
                the population’s irritability. However, the economic situation of the zone is likely
                to remain depressed in spite of a possible increase in Soviet assistance. The USSR
                is not willing to undertake <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>assistance on a
                sufficient scale markedly to improve the situation in the next few years and the
                  <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> regime lacks the flexibility and resources to
                do so on its own. A factor contributing to the depressed situation has been the
                continuous loss of manpower due to the flight of almost 300,000 refugees annually to
                the Federal Republic since 1953.</item>
              <label>36.</label>
              <item>Although the East Germans have little or no loyalty to their own regime, a
                majority appear to be socialist in orientation. In any reunification they would
                probably attempt to salvage some of the social changes—land reform, nationalization
                of large-scale industry, and the enhanced status of the workers relative to other
                East German groups—which they believe have been the only accomplishments of the
                occupation regime. Although these attitudes have lent some plausibility to the
                Soviet proposal for the reunification of the “two Germanys” on a “confederative
                basis,” the East Germans by and large recognize that the Soviets are using this
                formula as a device for perpetuating their control of East Germany.</item>
              <label>37.</label>
              <item>A widespread East German revolt seems unlikely in the next few years, although
                there is always the possibility of spontaneous outbreaks, particularly if there were
                uprisings elsewhere in the Satellite area. The population is aware, both through
                their own experience and by viewing the example of Hungary, that resort to force
                would prove abortive, if not disastrous. Moreover, it seems clear that the <gloss
                  target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> leaders, whose personal and political survival would
                be at stake, would assist in repressing disorders without mercy. They would probably
                consider the East German forces unreliable and would therefore depend almost
                entirely upon Soviet forces.</item>
              <label>38.</label>
              <item>While the present Soviet position on East Germany appears frozen, it is possible
                that the Kremlin will make changes in the leadership of the East German regime in an
                attempt to give it an appearance of respectability. Such alterations would be made
                only with due regard to the Soviet security position in Poland. Such a move would be
                designed to increase the chances for broadened international recognition of the East
                German regime and its acceptability within East Germany. Although the Soviets
                probably regard the present West German government as unlikely to make substantial
                concessions on reunification, such changes in East German leadership would have the
                effect of placing Bonn in a less advantageous position.</item>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Political and Economic Stability of West Germany</hi></p>
            <p>3. The Federal Republic is now the strongest economic power in Western Europe, has a
              stable political system, and is playing an increasingly prominent role in European and
              world affairs. As a result of the recent decisive electoral victory of Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s government, the prospects are good,
              at least for the next few years, for a <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0357"
              />moderate stable government allied with the West. Political extremism of either the
              Left or the Right is not now significant. The continued economic and political
              strength of the Federal Republic is very important to the success of U.S. policy in
              Europe.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">The Division of Germany and the Problem of Reunification</hi></p>
            <p>4. The division of Germany is a potential source of armed conflict and therefore a
              potential threat to U.S. security. Reunification will remain a central aim of West
              German policy and is a strong motivating force among the people of both East and West
              Germany. Until now West Germany has agreed with the United States and other Western
              powers in seeking reunification through free elections and avoiding any moves toward
              reunification which would jeopardize either West Germany’s security or a unified
              Germany’s political and military association with the West. At the same time, the USSR
              has rejected all Western proposals to settle the German problem through free
              elections, has insisted the problem must be settled by negotiation between the “two
              German states”, and more recently has indicated it would not enter into discussions of
              any kind with the Western Powers on the German problem. There is no early prospect of
              Soviet agreement to a reunified Germany which might become militarily associated with
              the West. The USSR would also demand a very heavy price from the West in exchange for
              any diminution of its tight control over East Germany.</p>
            <p>5. The West Germans have three possible lines of policy open to them. Broadly stated,
              these are: <list>
                <label>a.</label>
                <item>To seek a rapprochement with the USSR and the Satellites, in order to achieve
                  reunification while preserving an acceptable degree of independence from Soviet
                  control. This alternative would be given little consideration in West Germany
                  unless the United States acted in such a way as to signify abandonment or critical
                  reduction of defense commitments in Western Europe.</item>
                <label>b.</label>
                <item>To follow an independent course in foreign affairs, eschewing military
                  alliances and counting on a stalemate between East and West which would enable
                  West Germany to achieve a strongly independent neutral posture. So long as their
                  present confidence in the effectiveness and reliability of U.S. security
                  assurances continues to exist, however, most West Germans would not consider this
                  alternative seriously unless there was some better prospect than at present of
                  attaining reunification thereby.</item>
                <label>c.</label>
                <item>To remain firmly attached to the Western alliance, in confidence that the
                  strength and resolution of the West will protect West Germany against any attack
                  while it attempts to enlarge its role in the Western alliance and in the world at
                  large. During the next few years close cooperation with the Western alliance seems
                  likely to be regarded not only as the sole workable alternative for West Germany,
                  but also as affording opportunities for expansion of trade and influence.</item>
              </list></p>
            <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0358"/>
            <p>6. However, in order to retain West German association over the longer run and to
              reduce the likelihood of West German unilateral efforts to solve the reunification
              problem, the West must continue to convince the West Germans that it will seek, as and
              when possible, to achieve unification. The West Germans fear that the United States
              may make an agreement with the USSR of major character (such as a comprehensive
              disarmament agreement) without settling the problem of German unification. In
              addition, the United States might have difficulty convincing the West Germans of its
              sincerity in reunification were it to oppose a Soviet offer for reunification which
              the West Germans considered did not endanger their security and which was made at a
              time when the West Germans discounted the danger of Soviet aggressive designs.
              However, if the United States were willing to guarantee such a settlement, the
              readiness of West Germany to accept it would be increased.</p>
            <p>7. Since the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference of 1955 the Soviets have from time
              to time proposed the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, but have not linked
              withdrawals to German reunification. More frequently they have proposed withdrawal of
              all foreign troops from Europe, the liquidation of all foreign bases, and the
              abolition of all military pacts. In the West, various proposals for troop withdrawals
              have also been put forward, but these have been linked with an agreement on
              reunification and have been couched in terms of troop withdrawals from the center of
              Europe. Proponents argue that troop withdrawal proposals, if combined with
              satisfactory assurances of security for the West and with an agreement on
              reunification, might provide a feasible approach to removing the major irritant of a
              divided Germany. Proponents argue that such withdrawals would also reduce the threat
              of conflict which exists in the present confrontation of hostile Soviet and Western
              forces in the center of Europe. A major appeal to the United States of a plan
              providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe, without
              jeopardizing the security of Western Europe, would be the elimination of the major
              instrument of Soviet control in the area. At present, however, there is no indication
              of any Soviet interest in a withdrawal of forces on both sides under conditions which
              would provide reasonable assurances of security for the West. Furthermore, the West
              German and other Western European Governments would be strongly opposed to any
              significant reduction in the number of U.S. forces stationed in Germany, until there
              is some indication of change in the Soviet position regarding security and
              reunification.</p>
            <p>8. Proponents of German neutralization have argued that the Soviets will agree to
              reunification only upon terms which guarantee the neutralization of a unified Germany,
              and that the West Germans themselves may eventually accept a neutralized status
              outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0359"/>in order to achieve unification. They also
              argue that neutralization is not too heavy a price to pay for Soviet withdrawal from
              East Germany (and possibly other Satellites) and the diminution of the considerable
              dangers to peace inherent in the present division of Germany, the isolation of Berlin,
              and the confrontation of large hostile forces in Central Europe.</p>
            <p>9. The United States has maintained that the neutralization of Germany is not
              acceptable under present conditions for the following reasons: <list>
                <label>a.</label>
                <item>West German military association with Western Europe is very important to
                  strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capabilities in Europe.</item>
                <label>b.</label>
                <item>Financial and political considerations probably would militate against
                  relocation elsewhere in Europe of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces
                  withdrawn from West Germany, and might lead therefore to sizeable force
                  withdrawals from the Continent.</item>
                <label>c.</label>
                <item>A neutralized Germany would have such different political interests from those
                  of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies that it would not participate
                  fully in the efforts to achieve greater Western European integration. Without such
                  German participation, Western European integration is not likely to progress far
                  enough to enable Western Europe to achieve the strength and prosperity which would
                  best assure its independence over the long run.</item>
                <label>d.</label>
                <item>As long as Western Europeans continue to feel that their security depends on
                  U.S. participation in a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance, a

                  German Government and ties with the West as well as the support of other European
                  Governments for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Efforts to obtain the
                  agreement of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies to such a proposal
                  would run serious risks of having the same results.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">The Relationship of the Federal Republic to the Western
                Community</hi></p>
            <p>10. The participation of the German Federal Republic in a strong and effectively
              integrated Western European Community is essential if Western Europe is to realize its
              maximum potential as a counterweight to Soviet power. The success of the Community may
              likewise have a decisive bearing upon the completeness and dependability of West
              Germany’s association with the West. West German participation in an effective Western
              Community constitutes the best guarantee that West German strength will be used
              constructively, rather than independently, for the achievement of narrow nationalistic
              aims.</p>
            <p>11. West German disposition to cooperate with other Western countries stems in part
              from belief in the over-all superiority of the West. Recent evidence of Soviet
              scientific achievements has led the West Germans to believe that the United States and
              its Western allies must increase their efforts in order to maintain Western military
              and over-all superiority.</p>
            <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0360"/>
            <p>12. To an increasing extent the Federal Republic has assumed a leading role in the
              movement for Western European integration, and is participating actively in the
              European Coal and Steel Community, the embryo European Economic (Common Market)
              Community, and the Atomic (<gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>) Community. The
              West German attitude will be important in determining the future direction of these
              Communities, especially the rate at which the Six Members thereof<note n="2"
                xml:id="d136fn2">Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West
                Germany. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> move toward full economic union and
              toward increased political unity. It will also be important in determining many
              related matters, such as the kind of commercial policy the Six Members adopt in their
              trading relations with the outside world, and the ultimate character of a broad
              free-trade area which has been proposed to associate the United Kingdom and other
              Western European countries with the Six. However, increased economic strength and the
              avoidance of financial crisis in France and the United Kingdom may be the critical
              factors in determining the rate of progress of these institutions; and should it prove
              to be essential for them to obtain substantial foreign financial assistance, the
              willingness of the West Germans to provide a proportion of such aid would be
              important.</p>
            <p>13. The West Germans have some sense of dissatisfaction with their political
              relations with the West. They apparently expected, when they were given sovereignty,
              that they would enter more fully into the councils of the West. They feel that their
              actual and potential strength entitles them to play an increased role. They profess to
              find their role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> unsatisfactory. What they
              would probably like is a “political standing group” consisting of the United States
              and the United Kingdom, France and Federal Republic. The smaller European countries
              (particularly Italy and the Benelux countries), while recognizing German reunification
              as a U.S.–U.K.–French responsibility, are bitterly opposed to any system of regular
              Great Power consultation which they fear would exclude them from any voice in the
              formulation of Western policies.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">The Federal Republic’s Relations with Eastern Europe (including
                East Germany)</hi></p>
            <p>14. The Federal Republic has made it a cardinal point of foreign policy, as recently
              confirmed by its severance of relations with Yugoslavia, not to maintain diplomatic
              relations with countries which grant diplomatic recognition to the so-called German
              Democratic Republic. It has made an exception only in the case of the Soviet
              Union.</p>
            <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"/>
            <p>15. The Federal Republic’s official relations with the Soviet Union, always quite
              reserved, have become increasingly cool. These relations have not thus far contributed
              to the achievement of the maximum objectives of either power—for the Soviet Union, the
              detachment of the Federal Republic from the West; and, for the Federal Republic,
              progress toward German reunification. Even with respect to the minimum objectives—for
              the Soviet Union, considerable expansion of trade and cultural relations; and for the
              Federal Republic, the repatriation of all German nationals in the Soviet
              Union—progress has been minimal.</p>
            <p>16. In its relations with the Satellites other than East Germany, the Federal
              Republic appears to be moving toward a position of greater flexibility. In particular,
              the Federal Republic will seek to strengthen its economic ties in Eastern Europe. The
              West Germans consider that their interests are served by encouraging Communist
              deviation from Soviet hegemony. However, West German policy is as yet uncertain and
              cautious because of (a) the desire to prevent a broader recognition of the East Zone
              government; (b) uncertainty as to whether establishment of relations with Poland and
              other Eastern European countries would in fact loosen Soviet control over Eastern
              Europe; and (c) the extremely sensitive political issue of the Eastern boundaries of
              Germany.</p>
            <p>17. Any expansion of West German influence in Eastern Europe which loosens the ties
              between the USSR and the Satellites would advance U.S. objectives in that area. In
              view of the problems just cited, however, this can best be accomplished in the
              immediate future through the development of West German economic relations with the
              Eastern European countries (other than the Soviet Union) rather than by the
              establishment of diplomatic relations. West German trade missions in selected Eastern
              European countries would provide for official West German representation and could, to
              the extent that the Eastern European governments desire political contact with the
              Federal Republic, provide a cover for such contact. However, more extensive
              consultation with the Federal Republic on U.S. economic and political policies
              affecting the Eastern European countries would help to enhance and direct West German
              energies in that area.</p>
            <p>18. The Western Allies have taken the position that the Oder–Neisse line is temporary
              and that the final boundaries of Germany should be fixed in a peace settlement with
              the agreement of an all-German Government. They have taken no position on where the
              boundary should be. The Federal Government has from time to time hinted at the
              desirability of finding some compromise solution of the border question. However, it
              would be unwise for the United States to take a position on the boundary, at least
              until prospects for a settlement <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0362"/>are more
              promising, because to do so would incur the ill will of either the Poles or the
              Germans, or both.</p>
            <p>19. In East Germany the present Communist regime, though overwhelmingly opposed by
              the population, will be strongly entrenched as long as it is backed by massive Soviet
              military strength. The USSR has made clear its determination to maintain its power
              position in East Germany. The East German regime appears to be about to launch an
              intensified campaign to reduce Western influence on the population by reducing
              contacts between East Germany and the West. The Federal Republic fears Western
              involvement with Soviet military forces in the event of any large-scale uprising and
              has therefore strongly encouraged the East German population in its avoidance of
              active measures to change the existing situation. The Federal Government favors
              continued non-official economic relations with East Germany because it considers the
              Soviet Zone a source of needed commodities (e.g., brown coal). It also believes that a
              limited shoring up of the East German economy is an important factor in reducing the
              danger of an East German uprising and is a humanitarian duty towards less fortunate
              countrymen. (For a fuller discussion of U.S. policy toward East Germany, see
              Supplement II to this paper.)</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi></p>
            <p>20. The Berlin situation calls for the utmost vigilance on the part of the Western
              Powers. The Western Powers are publicly committed to defend their position in Berlin,
              and the loss of this position would have incalculable consequences in undermining the
              Western position in Germany and the world at large. Yet Berlin remains isolated behind
              the Iron Curtain and exposed to constant Communist pressures and harassment. While the
              pattern behind recent increased difficulties is not easy to discern, it seems probable
              that Communist efforts are directed at this time more toward sealing off the Soviet
              Zone from Western influence than toward a major interference with the Western lines of
              communication to Berlin. (For a fuller discussion of U.S. policy on Berlin, see
              Supplement I to this paper.)</p>

              psychologically or administratively prepared, some delay and difficulty was inevitable
              in the creation of West German armed forces. But the principal obstacles to building
              up an effective West German force have been, and will probably continue to be,
              uncertainty as to the basic strategic concepts upon which forces and weapons systems
              should be built and, to a lesser degree, a lack of popular enthusiasm for the costs
              and sacrifices <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0363"/>involved. Force goals for West

              plans for the period beyond 1958 can be expected.</p>
            <p>22.<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">A notation on the source text indicates that
                paragraph 22 was revised on January 2, 1958. No original text has been found in
                Department of State files.</note> The Federal Republic presently has approximately
              120,000 men in the armed forces, and recent planning figures show an interim strength
              goal for the armed forces (excluding territorial forces) of 303,000 men by 1961. The
              Army consists of seven divisions: three infantry divisions already committed to <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; two armored; one mountain; and one airborne. All
              seven are understrength and possess only a limited combat capability. By March 31,
              1959, the West Germans expect to have nine divisions, one at only brigade strength.
              The Navy’s present combat capability (principally minesweeping) is quite limited. A
              naval construction program is underway but will not be completed until 1961. The Air
              Force is still being organized and trained and has no combat units—primarily because
              of the difficulty of obtaining qualified pilots and land for airfields, and because of
              preoccupation with the implications of advanced aircraft types and missiles. West
              Germany has recently indicated an interest in integrating short-range tactical
              missiles in its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-committed forces. West German
              defense expenditures, although mounting, are only about 4.4% of gross national product
              as compared with 10.4% for the United States, 7.9% for the United Kingdom, and 7.6%
              for France. However, the Federal Republic has indicated to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> that West <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0364"/>German defense
              expenditures will increase sharply in 1958 and subsequent years.</p>
            <p>23. The United States has agreed to furnish the Federal Republic approximately $900
              million of military equipment as grant aid. Most of this matériel has now been
              delivered and no further aid is now contemplated, except for nominal amounts for
              training and possibly a modest mutual weapons development program. Present West German
              contracts for arms purchases outside West Germany total $1 billion, with approximately
              one-third of that total place in the United States. The West Germans at present are
              producing little military equipment other than transportation equipment and soft
              goods. West German manufacturers have been reluctant to engage in arms production, but
              this attitude is changing.</p>
            <p>24. The West German financial contribution to the support of other <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in West Germany has undergone successive
              annual reductions from a level of $1.7 billion per year agreed to in May 1952 to a
              level of $346 million for the period May 19, 1956–May 19, 1957. In May 1957
              negotiations resulted in a West German agreement to make what the West Germans claimed
              to be a “final” contribution of $285.7 million, of which the U.S. portion would be
              $77.4 million (half that of the preceding 12 months). The United States accepted this
              reduction, but reserved the right to request an additional $77.4 million for the
              balance of U.S. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958, after the West German
              election. In November 1957, the United States sent a formal note requesting the $77.4
              million, to which no reply has yet been received.<note n="6" xml:id="d136fn6">As the
                West German contribution to the support of U.S. forces in West Germany has declined,
                German dollar receipts from expenditures by U.S. military forces in West Germany
                have risen. Total receipts from such expenditures have reached a level of $408
                million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 and, without the additional $77.4
                million contribution requested from the West Germans, could reach a level of $500

                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> On December 3, 1957, the British, after
              failing in negotiations to have the Germans furnish 50 million pounds ($140 million)
              to cover the Deutschemark requirements of British troops in Germany for the year
              beginning April 1, 1958, invoked in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council
              the clause in the Brussels Treaty under which the United Kingdom reserved the right to
              withdraw troops committed to the Continent in case they encountered financial
              difficulties, including those of a foreign exchange nature. In doing so the British
              said that if satisfactory financial arrangements could not be worked out they would
              have to reconsider the whole question of how many troops they could maintain on the
              Continent.</p>
            <p>25. Inability on security grounds to disclose more fully to the West Germans
              information regarding certain weapons systems, has inhibited the Federal Republic in
              making the decisions needed for a <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0365"/>rapid
              military build-up. Security factors also have limited the scope of technical relations
              between West Germany and the arms-producing countries, particularly the United States,
              and have prevented the effective utilization of West German potential in the research
              and development field. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting and
              implementation of the principles enunciated in the
                <persName>Eisenhower</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
              talks should facilitate disclosure of technical information to the West Germans,
              particularly if the industrial security system in West Germany is improved. The
              prohibitions in the Brussels Treaty on the West German manufacture of certain types of
              weapons, particularly missiles, also limit the West German contribution to the
              development and production of these weapons. These limitations (other than those on
              atomic, biological or chemical weapons) can be amended or cancelled by a two-thirds
              vote of the Western European Union (<gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>) Council of
              Ministers, provided a request from the Federal Republic is supported by a
              recommendation by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>. The Federal Republic has
              not been disposed to date to initiate requests for modifying these limitations,
              although there have been indications that the West Germans are interested in
              undertaking with their neighbors, particularly France and Italy, research concerning
              nuclear weapons, leaving production of such weapons to their allies who are not
              restricted by treaty. Additionally there are indications that the West Germans are
              looking toward the development and manufacture in West Germany of shorter-range
              missiles.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">The Federal Republic’s Relation to Underdeveloped Areas</hi></p>
            <p>26. The Federal Republic has exhibited a lively interest in the underdeveloped areas.
              Its principal interest has been in expanding West German trade, but it has exhibited a
              healthy awareness of the basic political problems in these areas and of the need for
              combatting Soviet influence.</p>
            <p>27. It is evident from the size of West German gold and foreign exchange reserves
              ($5.75 billion as of October 31, 1957) and the current rate of increase (about $2
              billion a year) that the West Germans could provide a great deal more capital for
              foreign investment than they have provided in the past. Short and medium term credits
              have generally been provided where necessary to maintain the level of West German
              exports. However, the volume of West German long-term lending and direct investment by
              West German firms has not been large, in part because of the strong internal demand
              for capital in West Germany itself. The government has been reluctant to make public
              funds available for public lending even in a fashion analogous to the U.S. <gloss
                target="#t_ExIm1">Ex-Im</gloss> Bank. There have recently been a number of West
              German suggestions for increased coordination or new methods of coordination with the
              United States and other industrialized countries <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338"
                facs="0366"/>in the assistance field, but these suggestions appear to reflect hopes
              that further U.S. or international funds could thereby be obtained to supplement
              whatever rather circumscribed efforts the West Germans have been prepared to make
              themselves.</p>
            <p>28. Recently there have been some indications of a greater willingness on the part of
              the West Germans to extend credit abroad,<note n="7" xml:id="d136fn7">The West Germans
                have made the maximum portion of their <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>

                addition lent $175 million in U.S. dollars to the Bank. The Government has
                established a very small foreign aid program with funds of $12 million, largely for
                technical assistance, $2 million of which it has agreed, through <gloss

                committed itself to providing a $200 million contribution to the overseas investment
                fund of the Common Market. It also appears probable that credits will be provided to
                India which will postpone payments of perhaps $250 million coming due on Indian
                imports from West Germany. Some credits for new Indian orders may also be made
                available. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> although they are still attempting
              to limit their credits to sound loans of medium term. West German officials have begun

            <p>The Chancellor said that he was confident that his Parliament would approve of the
              storage of nuclear weapons and the establishment of nuclear sites in the Federal
              Republic but that it would be necessary to go through the process of parliamentary
              debate.</p>
            <p>I spoke of the Soviet proposal and of <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
              >Macmillan</persName>’s idea that perhaps it would be a good thing to agree that there
              should not be missile sites in the Federal Republic, East Germany, Poland or
              Czechoslovakia. I said that while as a military matter it might not be desirable or
              important to have such sites east of the Rhine, I had some question as to whether or
              not it would be good to give all of the Federal Republic a special status in this
              regard. It might be a move toward neutralization. The Chancellor said that he agreed
              with that point of view and that the Federal Republic would not be equated with East
              Germany.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor expressed the fear that there might be a change of US sentiment due to
              the fact that it would come under fire from Soviet ICBMs. He feared also that this
              might lead to the US exercising its right to withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss>. I said I did not think that there was any cause for concern on these
              points. I said that we had already assumed that Soviet bombers with megaton weapons
              would be able to inflict massive destruction on the US even though many of them were
              shot down and that whether or not this destruction was <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342"
                facs="0370"/>caused by the bombers that got through or by missiles did not
              particularly alter the situation.</p>
            <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (22 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
            <p>The Chancellor expressed the hope that we could in our speeches, particularly the
              public speech of the President, emphasize the importance of peace. I said that this
              was in the President’s mind but that I would carry to the President the Chancellor’s
              exhortation in this respect.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that he felt chagrined that although the US and indeed German
              military people really had knowledge of the Soviet advances in the way of missiles
              they had not adequately reacted. I said perhaps this was because the information went
              primarily to the Air Force and the Air Force tended to depreciate developments that
              might end up by putting them out of business.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor said that General Heusinger had felt that the command structure of
                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was so complicated that it would never work.
              He suggested that I should ask General Norstad to talk to the Chancellor and General
              Heusinger about this if there was an opportunity. I said I would try to communicate
              that thought to General Norstad this evening.</p>

              <item>The question of how to focus the heads of government meeting on important
                questions was canvassed. Secretary said it seemed impossible to have really frank
                exchange on important questions before 300 people. Ideally it would be well for
                heads of governments <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0371"/>to speak very frankly
                to each other, but probabilities were that each head of government, for domestic
                political reasons, would have to make a speech for home consumption. Chancellor
                agreed, citing Dutch need to speak on Indonesia, German need to speak on
                reunification and Berlin, possible Greek and Turkish desire to speak on Cyprus.
                Secretary thought much of real business would have to be done in private talks and
                in follow-up by <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. He went on, however, to say
                that dramatic effects of heads of government meeting should not be minimized. Its
                impact had already been demonstrated by Soviet reaction in sending <persName
                  corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> letters.<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3"

                Chancellor thought excellent. Secretary hoped that this would set pace, and perhaps
                limit wide-ranging speech-making which would consume too much time. At best, it was
                thought that general speeches would probably not be completed on Monday but would
                extend until Tuesday’s session. Germans thought it would be well to state at outset
                that heads of government meetings would be completed on Wednesday, thus putting
                premium on brevity and focusing attention on business at hand. Secretary remarked
                that British would like to extend meetings through Thursday, perhaps because of fact
                that Parliament adjourns on week-end. There was agreement that effort should be made
                to keep meeting concentrated on business at hand, with Wednesday as free as possible
                for very important business of considering and agreeing upon final
                communiqué.</item>

                  <label>a)</label>
                  <item>Support costs. Secretary asked Chancellor how <gloss target="#t_FedRep1"
                      >FedRep</gloss> was getting along on support costs question. Chancellor
                    replied that question is now before <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and
                    that <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> did not want to discuss question
                    at these meetings. Secretary stated importance we attach to a settlement,
                    especially to enable U.K. forces to remain on Continent, which is very important
                    for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Hallstein gave resume of discussions
                    with British, saying that <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> had had to
                    state bluntly that support costs cannot continue in view increased German
                    outlays for defense build-up. Said <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> had
                    offered British relief on foreign exchange problem in form advance payments on
                    debts and on armaments purchases; but that British had then shifted ground and
                    now based case on budgetary problem, which <gloss target="#t_FedRep1"
                      >FedRep</gloss> not in position to meet. Added that foreign exchange position
                    is only criterion on which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> asked to render
                    opinion and “that we have already offered to meet”. Secretary then said (and
                    Hallstein in an aside told <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0372"/>translator
                    to get this clearly across to Chancellor) that, while he did not want to take
                    sides in this matter, if British forces have to leave Germany it will be
                    difficult to convince U.S. public and Congress that U.S. forces should remain.
                    Chancellor made no reply.</item>

                  <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked what can be
                    done further to stimulate development in under-developed areas and how Germany
                    can help with this problem, particularly with Indian trade deficit in order to
                    prevent failure India’s five-year plan. Hallstein said Germany could help, it
                    has entree in certain areas—and Secretary added “you also have money”. Hallstein
                    expressed view that there should be coordination of efforts in this field, but
                    agreed with U.S. that no new <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> machinery
                    should be developed. Secretary added on broader economic matters it would be
                    well if German Economics Minister could have talk with Secretary <persName

                  <label>c)</label>
                  <item>Secretary then brought up question of France, saying that he thought France
                    is weakest point in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. While richly endowed
                    in material and human resources, France is politically sick. Its governments
                    must be truculent in international relations because of political weakness.
                    Germans agreed on this diagnosis, and on this point conversation ended.</item>

              <item>Support Costs</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the course of a briefing for the President regarding matters that <persName
                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> might raise with him during his call this
              morning, I mentioned the question of support costs for foreign forces in Germany. I
              said that the British might want to know what our intentions are with respect to
              support costs for our own forces next year, since this would have a bearing on the
              German decision to grant support to the British. While no decision had been taken in
              the Government <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0373"/>regarding our intentions for
              next year, it looked as though we had very little chance of getting any more money out
              of the Germans. We had asked for a second slice of $77 million for the current year,
              but had had no reply from the Germans. If we pressed for funds for next year, our
              chances of receiving even the $77 million would be reduced.</p>
            <p>The President said he thought the Germans had been very slow in meeting their defense
              obligation under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said that we have a
              Congressional problem and asked how this particular item is presented in the Defense
              budget. I said that the costs of our forces in Germany are presented by Defense as a
              separate item and that Congress in the past has not appropriated money for this
              purpose. I said that Brentano informed us very recently that expenditures for the
              German forces will begin to mount rather sharply next year; they expect to spend 14
              billion marks next year, 17 billion in 1959, and 21 billion in 1960. Currently they
              are spending 9 billion for their own forces and 1.2 billion for support of foreign
              forces.</p>
            <p>The President said he felt that the British have a serious problem here. As for
              ourselves, we are more or less committed to defense of the line in Europe in any
              event. Our request for support costs from the Germans has not the same basis as the
              British request. He thought that we would probably have to refrain from requesting
              support for next year even though there would be attacks on this decision from certain
              Congressional quarters.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he was very happy to
              see the President looking so well. He congratulated him on his quick recovery. He
              thought the President looked better now than when he saw him last spring.<note n="2"
                xml:id="d140fn2">See <ref target="#d112">Documents 112</ref> and <ref target="#d118"
                  >118</ref>.</note> The President inquired concerning the Chancellor’s health <pb
                n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0374"/>saying he had been very worried about him. The
              Chancellor said he had had nothing more than a case of grippe, but he felt well
              now.</p>
            <p>The President said he thought Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                >Macmillan</persName> had expressed a very good idea yesterday when he suggested
              that the Foreign Ministers consider the various matters which might result in
              resolutions or agreements that could be translated into the communiqué. He thought
              that the Ministers would be occupied for sometime and that the Heads of Government
              might not be required to meet until tomorrow. He thought that there had been enough
              talk around the council table and that the time had now come to work. <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he thought the first thing the Foreign
              Ministers should take up this morning is the communiqué. He thought it was a good idea
              for the Heads of Government to meet tomorrow, and he inquired whether the President
              was willing to meet again on Thursday. The President said he would be glad to attend
              the meeting if it were necessary to complete the conference.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he thought the British wished to
              prolong this meeting in order to avoid appearance before the House of Commons on
              Thursday. If, on the other hand, they arrived in London from a successful <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, they could limit their appearance to an
              explanation of the meeting itself.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor referred to Aneurin Bevan’s recent visit to Germany. The President
              interrupted to say that Bevan was recently in the United States and seemed to be
              making it his business to tell everyone how to run his affairs. <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that in their conversation, he had pointed
              out that Bevan hated the Germans. This hatred stemmed from a very short period of
              German history and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that he, too,
              could hate the British if he considered only a short period of British history. Bevan
              had replied he did not hate all Germans. Apparently, Bevan considered this
              conversation sufficient to report to the press that he and <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> had achieved a “broad measure of agreement.”</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that Minister Bech of Luxembourgh
              had recently remarked to him that if Germany were neutralized, a new political party
              composed of radical right and left would grow up in Germany to support union with the
              Soviet. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had made this same point to
              Bevan. The President said that nothing could be more wicked for Germany and the world
              than neutralization of Germany. He could see only one result of such neutralization,
              namely, absorption by the communists. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
              referred with some impatience to the recent lectures by George Kennan which
              unfortunately had made quite an impression. The President said that what Kennan really
              proposes is the neutralization of all of Europe, which would be the actual result of
              his proposal for neutralization of Germany. He described <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347"
                facs="0375"/>Kennan as a headline-seeker. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> said that unfortunately the opposition papers are quick to pick
              up this kind of thing.</p>
            <p>The President referred to elections in the United States, saying that the voters
              there are influenced by international relations in voting for the national ticket, and
              by national affairs in congressional elections. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> said that federal elections in Germany are all influenced by
              international developments. The President said this is due to the fact that the
              Parliament elects the government, which is not true in the United States.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that one of the greatest
              historical achievements to modern times is the fact that the United States has adapted
              itself to the important international role that it must play.</p>
            <p>Referring again to yesterday’s meeting, the President said he felt very strongly that
              the Council members had not observed a consultative procedure which so many of them
              had previously urged. Late in the afternoon, we had learned that seven representatives
              had already issued the texts of their remarks yesterday to the press. The President
              felt that this was a denial of the principle of consultation. <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he thought a mistake had been made by the
              Chairman who should have cautioned against the release of these presentations and
              should have arranged to hold a press conference himself following the meeting.</p>
            <p>As <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was taking his leave, the President
              said he was always happy to see him and said he hoped he would come to see him soon
              again in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that
              nothing would please him more.</p>

              freely exchanged views, only question brought up by Mayor [was] increase in toll rates
              in DDR levied on non-East German vehicles (Berlin to Bonn 628, Department 575, and
              Berlin to Bonn 636).<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">Telegram 628 from Berlin to Bonn
                reported that the German Democratic Republic had announced greatly increased road
                tolls for non-East German vehicles effective April 1. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                  >Ibid.,</hi> 962A.7162B/4–155)</note> Suhr, who is somewhat of a pessimist (and
              probably realizes this reputation since he took pains to say that the views he was
              expressing were not the most extreme voiced by the members of his Senat) stated that
              it was possible that we might be making the first move in the initiation of a new
              blockade. The Senat had already met that afternoon, will meet again this morning, and
              the Senat will discuss with the Berlin House of Representatives and with Bonn.</p>
            <p>According Suhr trucks serving West Berlin paid a total of 5,000,000 <gloss
                target="#t_DMW1">DMW</gloss> last year. On basis of new rates, same total and
              composition of traffic as last year, this total would be 40,000,000 <gloss
                target="#t_DMW1">DMW</gloss>. Last year Berlin budget provided 1,500,000 <gloss
                target="#t_DMW1">DMW</gloss> in order to help West Berlin truckers bear toll charges
              at previous rates. On basis this new figure, Berlin contribution would have to be
              31,000,000 <gloss target="#t_DMW1">DMW</gloss>. Very large truck which has been paying
              20 <gloss target="#t_DMW1">DMW</gloss> would, according to Mayor, have to pay 280
                <gloss target="#t_DMW1">DMW</gloss>. Many small independent truckers could not
              afford pay these increases out of their own pockets and if shortly after April 1, when
              the new rates come into effect, shortages should develop in some fresh foods such as
              milk, reaction of population could be serious and might even border <pb n="350"
                xml:id="pg_350" facs="0378"/>on panic. Therefore, Senat decided yesterday afternoon
              temporarily to advance what sums might be necessary to truckers in order to insure
              normal transport of food. (Suhr said fifty-nine percent of trucks serving Berlin are
              Berlin-owned.) This, however, can only be stop-gap temporary measure.</p>
            <p>Mayor Suhr recommends immediate action on side of West. Based on successful precedent
              in September 1951,<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">Reference is to the signing of the
                interzonal trade agreement on September 21, 1951, which brought about a reduction in

              East/West German talks now going on regarding implementation <gloss target="#t_IZT1"
                >IZT</gloss> agreement. (Report reached us this morning that this already done.) If
              this not successful, next step in his opinion should be stoppage of deliveries to East
              Zone. Certain other measures should be considered, such as increase of demurrage
              charges in West German ports against ships bringing cargoes for DDR. (Consideration
              might also be given to Kiel Canal possibility.) Furthermore, in Mayor’s opinion this
              abusive toll rate increase represents a breach of May 12, 1949, agreement ending
                blockade.<note n="5" xml:id="d141fn5">For text of the communiqué of May 5, 1949,

                  >ibid.,</hi> 1949, vol. III, p. 751.</note> Because of this he urges immediate
              protest of three Western Allies to Soviets. Suhr was fearful <gloss
                target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> will react lethargically and therefore requested
              general Allied support in Bonn of seriousness of situation being expressed not only by
              Berlin Senat but also by Bundestag Committee for All-German Affairs which has been
              meeting in Berlin during last three days and which yesterday adopted unanimous
              resolution being forwarded to Bundestag.</p>
            <p>Commandants assured Mayor Suhr that they shared his concern about potential grave
              seriousness this development and that they would communicate with their <gloss
                target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>ers. General Honnen told Mayor that we had already
              acted along this line and that we had learned that representatives of the three
              Western Allies had already discussed this situation in Bonn during the afternoon.</p>
            <p>After Mayor had left, it was decided that it would be undesirable and time consuming
              to attempt coordinate Allied position both in Berlin and in Bonn and in view of nature
              of subject, coordination should be within <gloss target="#t_AHC1">AHC</gloss>. French
              appeared agree with our tentative reaction that course of action most likely yield
              immediate results and therefore safest in long run would be immediate tripartite
              protest today to Soviets. British Deputy Commandant suggested desirability of first
              assessing whether Berlin-owned trucks with help of Senat subsidy could assure Senat
              essential Berlin requirements. However, British Commandant recognized that such an
              approach might not <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0379"/>take adequately into
              consideration importance of principle involved and possibilities inherent in this
              Communist move.</p>
            <p>Since two out of three commandants were under pressure depart quickly, discussion was
              very brief and above positions given more as indications of preliminary reactions
              rather than as their considered views.</p>
            <p>In general, we recommend as immediate first steps delivery today of tripartite note
              along lines suggested to Bonn yesterday<note n="6" xml:id="d141fn6">For text of the

              preliminary German measure as interruption implementation talks relating to <gloss

              possibility still exists Communist retreat (not impossible if their desire was
              harassment without intention of going so to extremes such as blockade) of actually
              taking positive counter-measure such as immediate increase of demurrage charges in
              Hamburg, since in turn this might lead to further positive step on Communist side,
              etc., making settlement more difficult.</p>
            <p>Paragraph which we suggest in our telegram to Bonn 636 as possible close (i.e.,

                  Communist authorities which will interfere with the transportation of goods to and
                  from the city of Berlin. The situation is being closely watched.</p>
                <p>“The United States is already consulting with the Germans, the British and the
                  French to consider what measures may prove necessary to assure the flow of goods
                  in and out of Berlin.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                962A.7162B/3–3155)</p></note> At the same time I urge caution and deliberation in
              putting into effect measures going beyond those that may be necessary in present stage
              and which might only have effect of elevating controversy to a level involving
              governmental prestige and of a character appearing to assume the initiation of a new
              blockade. As matters stand traffic is being cleared on Helmstedt Autobahn at normal
              rate for both passenger and freight, although higher rates of course being paid, and
              Senat’s action already reported insures at least temporary continuance.<note n="4"

              possibility of discussions in Treuhandstelle of economic justification for increased
              tariffs and in my opinion <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> should take
              initiative in developing in this forum what are the actual maintenance costs of
              Autobahn roads and bridges. Even if without satisfactory result, this might have
              result of exposing true Communist motivation and better set stage for direct action
              and/or retaliatory measures. Moreover, East press line is still that there is no
              reason for such excitement as has been generated in West, continues to insist that
              reasons for increased tolls are purely economic, and that they have never said they
              would not be ready to negotiate about them.</p>
            <p>I have taken the liberty to advance these personal views, shared by responsible
              members of my staff, and which conform to those expressed to me by some level-headed
              business men and Senat officials, because I feel that the Soviet response to our
              protest note is not likely to be immediate, or if immediate, to produce an early
              solution. If a possibility still exists for the Germans to work out a reasonable
              solution, which I still believe is conceivable, then it seems to me it would be a
              mistake to take the initiative in disrupting traffic patterns, thereby shaking
              confidence in ability of Berlin’s industry to deliver, commit the US indefinitely to
              direct use of its own resources, and of our own accord change the conditions under
              which the Autobahn access to Berlin is now used.</p>
            <p>Having in mind the basic importance of maintaining confidence in Berlin, I feel that
              the wording in the proposed statement contained in Department’s 2634 to Bonn, repeated
              Berlin 472, namely, “which <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0381"/>will interfere
              with the transportation of goods”, should be avoided at this time and some more
              innocuous phraseology substituted such as “drastically increasing the rates for
              passenger and freight traffic.”</p>
            <p>This message has been shown to General Honnen and he concurs.</p>

                2859 reported that despite pretensions by the East German economic experts that the

              our view of how allies and Germans should proceed deal with problem of increased
              highway tolls is as follows: <list>
                <label>1.</label>
                <item>Now that Allies have protested to Soviets, we believe a period up to roughly
                  three weeks should be allowed for West Germans to try to negotiate settlement
                  highway tolls through Interzonal Trade Office. This length of time probably
                  unavoidable (a) in order allow Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                  bureaucracy take account Allied protests, (b) because <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                    >GDR</gloss> would for reasons prestige refuse back down immediately (in 1951
                    <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> backed down after twenty days).</item>
                <label>2.</label>
                <item>While negotiating tactics and weapons must be left to West Germans, we believe
                  they should avoid overt drastic measures such as increased demurrage charges on
                    <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> cargoes, steps to impose levies on <gloss

                    >FedRep</gloss> exports would seem advisable for tactical purposes depending on
                  progress negotiations. Allies and West Germans should avoid initiating any change
                  in flow or pattern of traffic between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>
                  and West Berlin, i.e. expanding airlift, using military convoys or trucks for
                  commercial purposes, shifting traffic to rail, et cetera.</item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>If no progress made in negotiations this period, consideration should then be
                  given to more drastic countermeasures. Since such <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"
                    facs="0382"/>steps might well provoke more <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                  measures and bring situation closer to real blockade, these steps should not be
                  taken until plans for meeting real blockade conditions are fully decided
                  upon.</item>
                <label>4.</label>
                <item>Of course, if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> harasses other means
                  transport or interferes further with Autobahn traffic situation would enter

              befallen them. As is apparent from this letter, the text of which I send you herewith,
              their minor son Valery being depressed by the bad marks he received in school did not
              return home. Having entered the American sector of Berlin he was detained there and at
              the present time is in hands of American military authorities.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d145fn3">On March 18, Valery Lysikov entered the Western sectors of Berlin
                and sought asylum. Following exchanges between U.S. and Soviet authorities in Berlin
                and Moscow, and a meeting with his parents in Berlin, Lysikov initially reiterated
                his desire to stay in the West. On April 5, after spending several days in
                Frankfurt, he changed his mind and asked to be returned to his parents. His return
                was effected on April 9. Documentation on this incident is <hi rend="italic"

            <p>As you yourself can see the letter of the parents of Lysikov needs no explanation.
              You will understand therefrom that the “political” motives which have been attributed
              to the minor schoolboy Valery Lysikov cannot be taken seriously.</p>
            <p>Recalling our old acquaintanceship and those days when we fought together against a
              common enemy and also our friendly joint work in Berlin, I ask you to settle this
              matter and to return the schoolboy Valery to his parents. I hope that you fully
              understand the suffering of the parents of Lysikov. We are both also fathers and can
              consider this incident from the human point of view putting aside all irrelevant

              justification and strength.</p>
            <p>Background. Since 1952, <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> exchanges have increased
              steadily in importance, reaching level with deliveries each direction including
              certain invisibles valued slightly over DM-West 425 million calendar 1954 (including
              share West Berlin, which accounted for roughly 25 percent value total West German
              imports from Soviet Zone and less than 10 percent exports). Principal West German
              deliveries are iron, steel, and coke from Ruhr; agricultural produce; and gamut of
              producers and consumers goods whose export limited principally by poor Soviet Zone
              performance on counterdeliveries. Principal Soviet Zone exports brown coal briquettes;
              certain textiles; mineral oil products; sugar (now very short supply) and potatoes;
              and assortment of specialties such as office machines, cameras and optics, ceramics,
              hunting weapons, toys, Christmas decorations. Prospects for calendar 1955: at East
              German insistence, 1955 goods list signed January 19 ambitiously projects deliveries
              each direction at new high of 1 million accounting units equivalent DM-West. Prior
              road tax crisis, most <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>optimistic West German
              export estimate on fulfillment was 700 million but substantial increase in exchanges
              was expected, particularly in key products. For further recent background, see Bonn
              D–1740, February 15, 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic"

            <p>Comparative interests in <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>. In terms import policy
              and immediate requirements, healthy and relatively flexible West German economy
              clearly less vulnerable to impact suspension <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> than
              short-supply, rigidly planned East German economy. This particularly true at present
              juncture with Soviet Zone seriously short many raw materials needed for production and
              apparently under stress readjustments revised Soviet Bloc trading pattern,
              particularly in connection new <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>-Soviet trade
                agreement.<note n="4" xml:id="d146fn4">Reference is to the trade agreement signed at
                Moscow on March 25.</note> Soviet Zone also under pressure to repay in equal
              installments in 1955 and 1956 Soviet credit 485 million rubles given in August 1953,
              which will involve additional burden.</p>
            <p>On Western side only <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> import of substantial
              interest is brown coal briquettes (about 3.5 million tons during 1954 of which about ⅓
              went to West Berlin last year); remaining imports being of interest largely as
              function of West German interzonal export policy. Brown coal briquette receipts of
              substantial importance to West Berlin, and alternative receipts of inferior West
              German briquettes likely to involve complications in view present uncertainty re
              transport facilities between Berlin and Federal Republic. As regards effect on West
              German exports, diversification of West German deliveries such that no one industry of
              importance likely to be gravely affected. Main sectors of West German economy involved
              are Ruhr iron, steel and coke which have adequate backlog orders; agriculture, where,
              in view of over DM 80 million deliveries to Soviet Zone last year, some problems might
              arise under embargo; in finished goods sector, principal instance which occurs to us
              as involving difficulties is Berlin electro-technical industry.</p>
            <p>On Soviet Zone side, with very few exceptions resulting from negotiating compromises,
                <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> imports comprise products chosen by central
              trading authorities to meet pressing needs. Key sector <gloss target="#t_IZT1"
                >IZT</gloss> is covered by account No. 4, under which Ruhr iron, steel and coke
              traded against briquettes on virtual quid pro quo basis. Critical Soviet Zone need
              Ruhr products attested 1 by fulfillment briquette deliveries past 2 years despite
              Soviet Zone hostage this item. Even in past 2 months, during which deliveries from
              Soviet Zone under 1955 goods list generally very sparse pending clarification Soviet
              Zone delivery obligations to Soviet Bloc, briquette delivery schedules have been met.
              According Ministry Economics, Ruhr industrialists at Leipzig <pb n="358"
                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0386"/>Fair gained impression that under current readjustments
              Bloc trading pattern Soviet Zone expects fewer steel and coke imports from Bloc and
              thus more dependent than ever on Ruhr deliveries (Washington in better position
              evaluate than we).</p>
            <p>Specially imposed West German restrictions on import of traditional Soviet Zone
              consumer goods enumerated above would cause loss of profitable business for producing
              industries. Should also note that any West German restrictions this connection could
              probably be intensified helpfully if some restrictions imposed other Western countries
              (e.g., France bought $375,000 <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> office machinery
              1954 while U.S. purchased $1.7 million various goods from Soviet Zone in same
              periods).</p>
            <p>Conclusions. Clear that balance of advantage in terms economic vulnerability to
              reduction or stoppage <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> lies with West. This
              advantage sufficiently wide that unless <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
              Soviets have overriding pol motivations in mind they are likely to attempt to withdraw
              gracefully on Autobahn tax if faced with evidence Federal Republic determination to
              utilize <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> restrictions as countermeasure. However,
              equally clear that <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> restrictions constitute main
              weapon Allied countermeasures arsenal while Soviet side has other effective means
              harassment communications with Berlin. Therefore must consider that test strength
              would not necessarily lie between Autobahn tax and <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>
              restrictions but between broad harassment versus <gloss target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss>
              restrictions in which case comparative vulnerability would swing in favor Soviets.</p>
            <p>As policy problem for Western occupying powers, immediate use of <gloss
                target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> counterweapon has so far been simplified by prompt West
              German reactions to challenge. By its immediate suspension routine <gloss

              his desire to return to his parents. The American authorities concerned were, of
              course, preparing at that time to carry out his wishes.</p>
            <p>Lysikov’s request to return home was granted in response to a strong principle
              followed by the United States Government that each person must be allowed to determine
              his own fate. We have traditionally granted asylum to persons who have sought the
              protection of the United States Government. We have also insisted upon the right of
              those persons to leave when they so desired.</p>
            <p>I recognize the feelings which Lysikov’s parents must have had about their son and
              can well appreciate your remarks about the importance of looking at such cases from
              the humane point of view. In the same spirit, I hope you will understand my feelings
              in a problem which has been causing great concern to the American people. I have in

                Believe timing is of the essence this problem, and that no action should be taken

                While we concur in <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> view that new tolls should

                some increase of tolls over those which existed prior April 1. Accordingly do not

                xml:id="d149fn2">The Deputy Mayor of Berlin, Special Assistant to the Mayor for
                economic and financial questions, and Head of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1"
                  >CDU</gloss> faction in the Berlin House of Representatives, respectively.</note>
              four leading bankers, American newspaper correspondents and discussed Autobahn fees
              several times with Parkman and Honnen. Political leaders are inclined be more nervous
              than industrial community. Present situation in Berlin psychologically still good and
              no cause for worry. Believe, however, that if situation remains in present status for
              much more than week, signs of worry would increase and would be fanned by newspapers
              which are beginning to be critical of Berlin govt and Allies.</p>
            <p>As you are aware, fact of <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> govt Berlin and <gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> have given
              some groups Berlin and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> feeling that
              settlement road tax problem being hindered by party political considerations. While I
              do not subscribe to such views, I think they are real element in situation.</p>
            <p>It would be my recommendation that if we receive no reply from Pushkin by Wed,<note
                n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">April 20.</note> Brit and <gloss target="#t_Fr1">Fr</gloss>
              should be immediately consulted London and Paris with idea making démarche in Moscow
              jointly, preferably without immediate publicity, but with info given to <gloss
                target="#t_Chanc1">Chanc</gloss> and Suhr that such a step was made. Anticipating
              Moscow note we now beginning drafting with <gloss target="#t_Fr1">Fr</gloss> and Brit.
              In view desirability stepped up note schedule, I now believe drafting should be done
              in Bonn rather than capitals.</p>
            <p>In note to Moscow I believe we should stress <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> 1949
              obligations to maintain normal access to Berlin but should repeat demands <pb n="363"
                xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"/>for lowering tolls without going into discussion of
              proper <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> negotiating channels.</p>
            <p>If in its reply Moscow argues that our giving up occupation status <gloss
                target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> provides justification their doing exactly same,
              I would think following line argumentation could be made privately and eventually
              publicly. <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss>s cannot delegate to any <gloss
                target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> authority or group however constituted their
              international commitment in re to free access Berlin. Therefore, while we could not
              perhaps sanction their commitment in re to fees between, let us say, Hof and Leipzig,
              we would maintain they must themselves continue to control and be responsible for
              normal functioning traffic three main roads to Berlin and would propose to them
              quadripartite status of these roads and support of their upkeep.</p>
            <p>Whether any of above lines of action recommend themselves to <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                >Dept</gloss>, I should report that Brit Commandant Oliver, with whom I discussed
              these matters briefly, was essentially thinking along my lines. Did not venture any
              discussion these points with Gers. Several of <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>
              bankers suggested whole matter was matter of business trading and suggested we could
              buy off Russians in Moscow by some sort of minor economic concession. This I do not
              recommend, but I am reporting only to indicate attitudes of some Berlin
              industrialists.</p>
            <p>I think there should be no talk publicly and very little privately of measures that
              would smack of trying to get around a blockade. There is little talk in Berlin of this
              being a blockade. They feel it is much more question of blackmail. Therefore plans for
              using military trucks and trains for commercial freight should not now be actively
              discussed between three occupying powers as leak of such ideas might have adverse
              effect on morale of Berlin.</p>
            <p>In meantime we are putting pressure on <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to
              continue to strengthen counter measures on interzonal trade along lines of previous
              telegrams. But in addition to this, I believe matter of principle should be settled as
              1951 protest, although it solved immed problem increased road tax, did leave ambiguous
              question of <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> responsibility insure normal access.
              Will have especially beneficial effect Berlin politically and psychologically if we
              can elicit <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> admission continued four power
              responsibility Berlin.</p>
            <p>Since dictating above, I have seen <gloss target="#t_Chanc1">Chanc</gloss> and told
              him of my personal opinion as to proper procedure if Pushkin fails to reply or gives
              evasive reply. He would welcome prompt action bringing this matter to attention
              Moscow. He will have cabinet meeting in Berlin next Tues April 26. It would be highly
              important if it were clear that progress were being made in solution of problem of
              fees on Autobahn. Westrick in conversation this noon emphasized this point. Therefore
              I hope Wash will be prepared take up with London and <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364"
                facs="0392"/>Paris not later than Wednesday démarche in Moscow Thurs or Fri this

              action his govt on interzonal trade, he referred me to Westrick, whom I have just
              seen. Westrick is pessimistic about effectiveness their measures and is much disturbed
              about counter-measures from East affecting particularly delivery of brown coal
              brickets. He promises however to have at least slowing-down action on deliveries to
              take place at once. We are exploring further what seems to be disagreement on facts in

              prepared to risk another blockade of Berlin in face of determined and firm Allied
              reaction, and he therefore urged that we send strong note to <gloss target="#t_Sov1"
                >Sov</gloss>s without further delay. What was at issue, he said, was free access to

                >Sov</gloss>s in accordance with 1949 agreements, or was to pass to control of DDR.
              Re direct talks between ministries, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was

            <p>I believe most important single factor in our solution this problem, or larger ones

            <p>Following receipt of telegram 3221 (<ref target="#d151"><hi rend="italic"
                >supra</hi></ref>), the Department of State agreed to the dispatch of identic
              tripartite notes to the Soviet Government. Coordination was handled by the High
              Commissioners at Bonn, and the draft text was presented to Chancellor <persName
                corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> for his approval. The note was then transmitted
              to Moscow for delivery on April 30.</p>
            <p>Shortly before the note was to be delivered, the Soviet High Commissioner replied to
              the April 15 letter from the three Western High Commissioners. Pushkin stated that the
              question of tolls lay completely within the competence of the German Democratic
              Republic, but agreed to a meeting of the four High Commissioners if the Western powers
              still felt it desirable. Pushkin’s reply forestalled delivery of the note in Moscow,
              and the United States, the United Kingdom, and France decided to continue protesting
              at the High Commissioner level. In similar replies, dated May 2, they stated that they
              could not accept this Soviet position and proposed May 7 for <pb n="367"
                xml:id="pg_367" facs="0395"/>the quadripartite meeting. After further discussion,
              the date for the meeting was set for May 20.</p>

              Commissioner on phone. Talked with Vice Chancellor Bluecher and Erhard. In view public
              opinion situation in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and the fact that I am
              today in Berlin with Secretary of Commerce and will be tomorrow, I decided it was
              necessary to make some statement to the press to avoid getting entangled in
              complicated argument with press or German officials and businessmen we will be seeing
              in the next 24 hours. Dowling, British and French High Commissioners’ representatives
              meeting today in Bonn have been told of my intention to issue brief statement at 4
              p.m. today Berlin time. Gave the following to the press: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“Statement issued by the US High Commissioner for Germany, released to press at 4
                  p.m., May 1:</p>
                <p>“In answer to a question from the press, the US High Commissioner made the
                  following statement in regard to the note which was sent to him by the Soviet High
                  Commissioner dated April 30th:</p>
                <p>“ ‘I read the Soviet High Commissioner’s note for the first time when I arrived
                  in Berlin this morning. I have not had a chance to consult with my British and
                  French colleagues. It seems clear to me, however, that the position taken by the
                  Soviet High Commissioner is completely untenable. The question of tariffs on the
                  roads leading from the Federal Republic of Germany to Berlin must be regarded as
                  being within the competence of the Soviet Government. The responsibility for free
                  access to Berlin agreed to in 1949 cannot be transferred.’ ”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>
            <p>Understand a proposed note to Pushkin not inconsistent with this statement is being
              prepared in Bonn and will be sent here for my comments.</p>
            <p>Have discussed matter with Parkman and Honnen who are not in disagreement with point
              of view presented in my statement, but responsibility for issuing it is my own.</p>
            <p>I am still of the opinion that to bring this matter to a satisfactory solution will
              require some representations Moscow although not necessarily in public. I believe we
              cannot expect the <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to continue to pay
              blackmail much longer. We must force Soviets to recognize their responsibility 1949
              agreement for the access to Berlin. Our previous notes to Pushkin<note n="3"
                xml:id="d153fn3">For texts of the first and second notes to Pushkin, see Department
                of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, April 18, 1955, p. 648 and May 2, 1955, p.
                736.</note> have attacked the broader issue, namely, normal traffic within the
              Soviet Zone. I believe we should now concentrate on the three roads to Berlin and not
              let Soviets evade their responsibility according to 1949 agreement. If at High
              Commissioner’s level or in Moscow we can get this issue faced, seems to me agreement
              could be made by which a lump sum payment annually for use of these three roads would
              be agreed to by four powers concerned. Thus establishing correct principle, we could
              retreat from our earlier position of demanding reduction exorbitant tariff on other
              roads in East Zone. Do not believe it will be necessary to come to a showdown, but if
              it is, repeat my recommendation of employing military trucks.</p>
            <p>In my conversations last evening with Bluecher and Erhard pointed out that if we
              forced this issue of Soviet responsibility for free access Berlin, we might have to
              contemplate drastic action and in that case would expect full cooperation from the
                <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in regard to countermeasures whatever harm
              it might do their trade. Erhard and Bluecher seemed to agree to this proposition. They
              were strongly of the opinion that we could not let position taken by Pushkin in his
              most recent note stand unchallenged.</p>
            <p>I endorse views expressed in Berlin telegram to Bonn 751, repeated Department 689,

            <p>On question payments for upkeep roads, suggest Soviets be told Federal Republic
              willing bear reasonable and fairly assessed share such costs. In order arrive sound
              estimates, Allies desire send military engineer team to survey roads in question. If
              proposal rejected could then fall back on quadripartite team. Implication should be
              avoided Allies considering payment for any Allied traffic. This would be conceding
              something even Soviets not presently attempting press and might set unwholesome and
              dangerous precedent affecting all Allied surface access Berlin. Should Federal
              Republic require financial assistance, this could be worked out between Allies and
              Federal Republic and is of no concern to Soviets.</p>
            <p>Agree payments should be continued until Allied-Federal Republic agreement on further
              steps reached. In this connection believe, as previously stated, full use other
              facilities, e.g., rail, barge, must be made. Department informed that for first nine
              months 1954, almost 700 train paths not used. If trend has continued, believe rail

              relating possible use of force should not be proposed British and French until further
              notice.</p>
            <p>Department further believes West German measures designed put pressure East Zone
              should continue apace with current Allied activity so that communists will have
              incentive to agree reasonable settlement. By time we may find it necessary resort to
              use military trucks or airlift, Federal Republic should have exhausted all
              counter-measures at its command.</p>
            <p>We assume much of above will be dependent upon evaluation of meeting with Pushkin and

            <p>Mayor Suhr called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> on May 16 at
              11:30 a.m. and presented the Deputy Under Secretary with a replica of the Freedom Bell
              in recognition of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s interest in the
              City of Berlin.</p>
            <p>After an exchange of amenities, Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> turned to the question
              of the Congress Hall which is planned to be the U.S. contribution to the Berlin
              Building Exhibit of 1957. Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> pointed out that it was most
              important for Berlin to have such a hall; for in a divided country professional,
              social and youth organizations and similar groups are especially important in
              reestablishing unity. He recalled that in his younger years, while studying political
              science, he wrote a thesis on the factors which brought about German unification n the
              late 19th century and came to the conclusion that it was congresses of professional
              people that contributed more than anything to Germany’s unification. He asked Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> to excuse the fact that he was
              “blowing the trumpet of unity” but he felt that as a Berliner this was his major
              concern, and that as to the Congress building, he hoped sincerely that it might be
              possible to have the Bundestag meet in it when holding a session in Berlin.</p>
            <p>In response to a remark of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s
              concerning Berlin’s relative slowness in absorbing Nazi principles in the thirties,
              Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> replied that in 1931 unemployed Nazis and Communists
              joined together in a major strike which paralyzed the City. He noted that it was
              remarkable that in spite of the large unemployment now in Berlin, there are no
              successful radical elements. He had feared that the Communists and the Deutsche Partei
              might win some seats in the 1954 elections, but noted with gratification that the
              voters rejected both parties.</p>
            <p>In this connection, Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> turned to the current structure of
              the Berlin City Government and said that he prefers to have a party in opposition
              because it strengthens the democratic process, especially since there are no major
              issues which divide the coalition and the opposition.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then asked Dr.
                <persName>Suhr</persName> about the Autobahn tolls. Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName>
              replied that he had always been of one opinion with Ambassador Conant and Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that traffic to and from the City had
              to continue at its present level, and as long as it was necessary, appropriate
              payments had to be made. He said this opinion was not always shared by Finance
              Minister Schaeffer. Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> was especially forceful in
              expressing his approval of the reference to the Paris Agreement of 1949 in the latest
              note to Mr. <persName>Pushkin</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">For text of the
                note from Conant to Pushkin, May 2, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                  >Bulletin,</hi> May 23, 1955, p. 834.</note> since it seemed to him vital that the
              partners to that agreement solve this problem among themselves. He indicated that in
              the meantime, Germany <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>was imposing a
              slow-down on steel deliveries. Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> also ventured the
              assumption that the decision on the road tolls was made at Pankow and not in Moscow
              and that it was therefore relatively easy for Moscow to change the policy.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> pointed out there continued to be other methods of
              needling the people of Berlin. For instance, during the last 2 weeks, it has become
              necessary for people leaving the Soviet Zone to have certificates issued by the local
                <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> Control Office certifying that they will not
              work against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime. He also indicated that
              the Soviet Zone Border Police had orders to shoot to kill illegal border crossers.
              After pointing out these Communist techniques, Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> hastened
              to assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> that there is no
              nervousness in Berlin.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Hertz</persName> then turned to the problem of unemployment in Berlin
              pointing out that figures are now lower than at any time since the blockade, having
              reached 160,000 unemployed and that it may be expected that this figure will be
              reduced to 125,000 providing the present trend continues. He indicated that one of the
              reasons why it was necessary to maintain Autobahn traffic even at the excessive toll
              rate was to assure the downward trend in the unemployment rate.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked the level of the present
              unemployment compensation and Dr. <persName>Hertz</persName> explained that
              unemployment compensation was at ⅔ of the unemployed person’s normal salary, but even
              at that level, the individual was likely to become a political liability if unemployed
              over any length of time. He also explained that about ¼ of the total unemployment
              compensation expenditures are going to white collar workers who are being maintained
              in Berlin in preparation for the future when Berlin will once more become Germany’s
              administrative center. He reiterated, however, that it is impossible to maintain the
              present unemployment level, and that efforts must constantly be made to reduce that
              level as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> agreed with Dr. <persName>Hertz</persName>’ statement
              and noted that anyone visiting Berlin now would recognize that there is no waste, that
              the monies that have been invested are well-invested and have brought about political
              stability.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> then returned to the problem of reunification and
              expressed the hope that the President’s statement made at the time of Ambassador
              Krekeler’s presentation of his credentials would be given additional publicity as it
              had not been sufficiently publicized in Berlin.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">For text
                of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s remarks on May 6 on

                  rend="italic">ibid..</hi> May 16, 1955, p. 795.</note></p>
            <p>The Deputy Under Secretary then asked how the average Berliner views the methods of
              achieving reunification. Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> replied <pb n="375"
                xml:id="pg_375" facs="0403"/>that Berliners were generally realistic on the subject
              and did not expect a solution to come out of the forthcoming Four Power
                Conference,<note n="4" xml:id="d159fn4">For documentation on the preparations for
                the Four-Power Conference, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05#pg_537">vol. v, pp.
                  537</ref> ff.</note> but did expect a step in the right direction. It should be
              clear, however, that Berliners will not favor a solution which cannot be agreed to by
              the United States. Any so-called “Schauckelpolitik”<note n="5" xml:id="d159fn5">The
                policy of playing the East off against the West and vice versa.</note> is out of the
              question. There seems to be a general feeling in Berlin, however, according to Dr.
                <persName>Suhr</persName>, that the situation is more fluid since the Austrian
              Treaty has been signed and that the recent speech by Marshall <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> at Warsaw was read with interest in
                Berlin.<note n="6" xml:id="d159fn6">For text of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                  >Bulganin</persName>’s speech at the opening session of the Warsaw Conference, May

                scheduled to visit Belgrade May 26–June 2.</note> will also contribute to a feeling
              that the international situation is becoming more fluid. Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName>
              then pointed out that a visit of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                >Eisenhower</persName> to Berlin would really bolster the cause of German
              reunification.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> proceeded to point out that what Berliners really
              oppose is the solution sometimes discussed, namely a coexistence of the two Germanys.
              While there may be a coexistence of the two world powers, there cannot be coexistence
              on German soil.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked about the Eastern
              Territories, a question that was somewhat misunderstood both by Dr.
                <persName>Suhr</persName> and Mr. <persName>Hertz</persName> because in their reply
              they addressed themselves to trade relations with the satellites. Dr.
                <persName>Suhr</persName> pointed out that the Leipzig Fair has somewhat reduced the
              importance of the Berlin Industrial Fair and while he favored trade relations with the
              Eastern bloc if it helped reunification, he was opposed to it if it would detract from
              Berlin’s position as a fair center. Dr. <persName>Hertz</persName> added that it had
              been hoped to turn the Berlin Fair into a real trade fair but that it had seriously
              felt the competition of the Leipzig Fair in 1954. He hoped this could be remedied,
              however, since both buyers and sellers had been disappointed at the Leipzig Fair
              because the Eastern bloc had very little to sell. Dr. <persName>Hertz</persName> hoped
              the United States would strengthen the Berlin Industries Fair by its participation in
              it as well as in the Berlin Building Exhibit.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Suhr</persName> ended with a personal invitation to Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> to visit Berlin very soon.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName></hi>: I am
              venturing to trouble you with this personal letter about the situation in Berlin
              because our conversations with Pushkin yesterday were not only unsatisfactory, but
              from my point of view rather alarming.</p>
            <p>You will have already received through telegraphic channels reports on the
                meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">Conant sent a summary of the meeting with
                Pushkin in telegram 749 from Berlin, May 20. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central

                Conant is printed in <hi rend="italic">My Several Lives,</hi> pp. 604–605.</note>
              What I should like to present in this letter in some detail are the probable
              consequences of the courses of action which seem to lie before you and The President.
              I should like to emphasize, furthermore, that a decision between these courses must be
              made within a few weeks at most, as otherwise by failure to act we shall find
              ourselves on a course which looks the easiest but the consequences of which for the
              long run may well be most serious.</p>
            <p>Let me present to you what I think will be the consequences of our failure to
              challenge the Soviet position and obtain from them satisfaction in regard to free
              access to Berlin. The Federal Republic of Germany has taken some steps already towards
              an economic blockade of the Soviet Zone, but these have only been in the nature of
              preliminary measures. Those responsible for giving licenses for export from the
              Federal Republic to the Soviet Zone have retarded the issuing of licenses. They are
              now at a point where they will either have to resume giving the licenses at a normal
              rate because of the pressure from their industrialists or break their trade agreements
              and declare economic war against the Soviet Zone. Naturally they are very loathe to
              take this final drastic step, for they are quite certain that in such an economic war
              the Soviet Zone can inflict considerable damage on them although everyone admits they,
              in turn, can do serious damage to the Soviet Zone and thus indirectly to the Soviet
              Government itself.</p>
            <p>If the present situation continues and the Federal Republic continues to subsidize
              the truckers using the Autobahn, the economic life of Berlin may remain without damage
              for the immediate future. However, under these conditions, it is almost certain that
              the permits to export materials to the Soviet Zone will have to be issued in their
              normal number and the Soviets will clearly realize that they have won a victory on
              that front. To be sure, at some later time it would <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377"
                facs="0405"/>be possible to institute an embargo and declare economic war, but it
              would be much harder to do so once the present stand has been abandoned. Furthermore,
              there is no assurance at all that if the Soviets believe they have won the present
              battle, they will not proceed to further harassments. This they could do by increasing
              the taxes still higher and by interfering with the barge traffic on the waterways,
              which traffic has already in the last few weeks been harassed by minor difficulties.
              Indeed, there is no end to the number of things that could be done to interfere with
              the transport of goods and people between the Federal Republic and West Germany. Each
              time when we protested such actions, we would presumably get the answer I received
              yesterday, namely, this was solely an affair of the German Democratic Republic and we
              should direct officials of the Federal Republic to get in touch with officials of the
              German Democratic Republic to settle these purely German matters.</p>
            <p>The most serious statement which Pushkin made to us yesterday was that the German
              Democratic Republic was “master of the roads” in its territory. When I asked him what
              this meant and specifically raised the question whether that meant that the German
              authorities could increase taxes as much as they wished, regulate the type of vehicles
              using the roads and the hours at which the vehicles would operate, he replied these
              were artificial questions which he refused to answer. In short, he did not in any way
              modify his categoric statement that the German Democratic Republic was master of the
              roads to Berlin. I hardly need underline the consequences of our acceptance of this
              position.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that a great deal is at stake in this issue. I am afraid that our
              French friends, and possibly even our British, may be only too inclined to agree with
              part of the Soviet thesis, namely that we might recognize the German Democratic
              Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany as being the competent authorities. That
              the consequences of this would be an endorsement of the division of Germany is
              obvious; furthermore, we should by handing over traffic control to the Germans negate
              all that we have said about our determination to sustain Berlin as a healthy economic
              outpost of freedom. For the life of Berlin depends on free access to Berlin.</p>
            <p>What may be even more serious would be the effect on West Germany. I am afraid that
              if we cannot take a strong position on this matter of free access to Berlin, the
              political forces in the Federal Republic of Germany which have been oriented towards
              us will have their position undermined. I would venture to think that the Soviets are
              hoping to use the Austrian example not as an immediate pattern for the reunification
              of Germany, but after having strengthened their satellite government, that of the
              German Democratic Republic, they would then indicate by a merger of this government
              and some government <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0406"/>in Bonn reunification
              could be assured. This is not something that is likely to happen within the next few
              months, but I think they are calculating in terms of years. Certainly there are
              politicians in West Germany who might be ready to go down a road looking to a merger
              of Pankow and Bonn without recognizing the validity of the Prague experience. From my
              point of view, this is perhaps the one way in which we might lose Germany. For unless
              the Germans in the Federal Republic are convinced that we are strong and ready to
              stand up against the Russians, it would only be natural if they should think there was
              more to be gained by being friendly to the Russians than to the United States. If I am
              at all right in this diagnosis, far more is involved at present than free access to
              Berlin, and far more than what is sometimes regarded as a mere matter of taxes on an
              autobahn.</p>
            <p>I had a meeting this morning with General Cook<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">General
                  <persName>Orval R. Cook</persName>, Deputy U.S. Commander, Europe.</note> and
              explained to him in some details what seemed to me the stakes which are here at issue.
              I outlined to him what I thought was the line of procedure which we, the United
              States, should take, though I recognize that many military considerations must be
              taken into account which I am not competent to pass judgment on. What I do feel
              strongly is that the consequences of the various alternatives we might embrace should
              be clearly recognized by the highest authorities in Washington. I have outlined above
              the consequences which would follow, in my opinion, from inaction or further
              acquiescence in the blackmail of the Soviet Union through their German agents, the
              German Democratic Republic. Let me try to be equally frank and clear about the
              consequences of what I am proposing as an alternative.</p>
            <p>It must be admitted at the outset that if we challenge the Russians on this issue,
              war may be a consequence. It would certainly be far beyond my competence to weigh the
              probabilities of such an outcome or the consequences against the consequences I
              outlined above. I cannot help expressing the feeling, however, that the Russians would
              not in the last resort bring about a third world war if we were strong along the lines
              I shall now outline, but I do not want to dodge the final implications.</p>
            <p>What I would propose would be the following. First, either at once or immediately
              following the British elections,<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">The British general
                election was scheduled for May 26.</note> the three Western Powers orally present
              their views to Moscow as to the seriousness of Pushkin’s stand and the present
              situation; that they indicate that unless immediate action is taken to remedy the
              situation, all talk of a 4-power talk must be abandoned; and that instead of speaking
              about a climate of opinion which is relaxing, we shall be in a state of <pb n="379"
                xml:id="pg_379" facs="0407"/>tension which is most serious indeed. If the secret
              negotiations bring about no result, then in a very short time this stand should be
              taken in public and we should announce there would be no 4-power talks until the
              problem of free access to Berlin was settled.</p>
            <p>Assuming that there is no successful outcome of the secret talks and that a public
              statement of our unwillingness to meet on a 4-power basis as long as the Berlin
              situation remains unclarified was ineffective, then I would advocate the following
              course: First, agreement by the Federal Republic of Germany that they would be
              prepared to institute the severest possible economic measures against the Soviet Zone
              and hold to them irrespective of whatever counter-measures the Soviet Zone might put
              into effect. At the same time, I would try to get the approval of the other <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to join in this economic blockade. At a date
              to be determined in advance, this action should be announced and at the same time the
              Federal Republic would stop subsidizing the trucking to and from Berlin.
              Simultaneously the United States, with the concurrence of the two Western Occupying
              Powers, would announce (a) that they were going to make a payment to the Soviet Union
              at the previous rate for the maintenance of the roads to and from Berlin and (b) that
              they were going to move civilian goods by U.S. vehicles,—in short, that we were going
              into the trucking business. If the Soviets reply that they would stop such vehicles by
              force, then either we would test the reality of that proclamation by sending trucks to
              the checking point with or without a military escort (on this point I am not prepared
              to be too specific) or announce that the Soviet Union had broken its 1949 agreement as
              to free access to Berlin a second time. This action would demonstrate to the entire
              world that what was involved here was free access to Berlin for civilian goods and not
              a mere haggling about fees (which at present seems to be the general impression in
              some parts of the world). I think if the Russians persisted in refusing to allow the
              Occupation Powers to keep Berlin’s economic life healthy by means of a trucking
              service, then we should institute an airlift for this same purpose. This could be kept
              going long enough to ensure that this whole problem would be brought to focus in the
              United Nations and by other means. If the Russians should shoot down our planes or
              stop our military vehicles (which they now say they will not interfere with), then the
              possibilities of a general war would be just over the horizon. How long we could
              operate an airlift without bringing about a general war, I am not prepared to say. It
              seems to me, we would be back to 1948, but in a stronger position since a severe
              economic blockade of the Soviet Zone would be a weapon in our hand which in a few
              months would yield some results.</p>
            <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0408"/>
            <p>Of one thing I am quite sure, namely that the process of rearming West Germany would
              be speeded up to a degree by such a series of actions that it is hard for us now to
              imagine. I further venture the prophecy that if we proceed carefully along some such
              lines as I have indicated, we can hold not only the major parties in the Bundestag on
              our side, but probably get considerable support from the Social Democrats as well.
              What the position of our French and British allies would be is harder to estimate, but
              in view of the public position taken by the Foreign Ministers of those countries, it
              is hard to see how they can publicly renege on the principles for which we shall be
              taking expensive and drastic action.</p>
            <p>I have not discussed any of these details with my British and French colleagues, nor
              with the Chancellor. I did have an opportunity of speaking briefly with Hallstein
              Thursday night. I said that if our conversations with Pushkin were unsuccessful, I
              hoped the Federal Republic would be willing to take drastic measures along economic
              lines, even though such measures would lead to reprisals that would hurt Western
              Germany. He agreed with me, and I think we can count on his support of such a program
              as I have in mind, and the Chancellor’s. However, unless we are ready to go at least
              as far as I have indicated in challenging the Russian contention about the mastery of
              the roads to and from Berlin, we cannot expect the Federal Republic to declare
              economic war on the Soviet Zone. If anything effective is to be done, we must act
              together.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, let me point out that we are by no means presenting the Soviets with a
              hard alternative. There are several ways in which they can get out of their present
              position without undue loss of face. One method which is least satisfactory from our
              point of view would be for them to direct their East German representative in the
              Treuhandstelle (an unofficial group for furthering East-West trade) to negotiate with
              the West German representative and agree on an annual or monthly payment of a fee to
              cover the costs of maintaining the roads to and from Berlin. A settlement of the
              problem of high fees came about in 1951 through the Treuhandstelle. If the reduction
              were to an amount comparable with that previously charged, then the immediate payment
              of blackmail would have ceased. But the basic issue of who controls the roads would
              not have been settled. Indeed, this was unfortunately left uncertain in 1951 when fees
              were instituted. Nevertheless, because of the inherent dangers of the whole situation,
              I would favor accepting a solution at the Treuhandstelle level provided we at some
              later 4-power meeting insisted on a restatement of the 1949 agreement, with the
              addition that any fees charged for the use of the Autobahn should be reasonable as
              determined by negotiations between the four occupying powers.</p>
            <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0409"/>
            <p>Another way in which the Soviets could got out of their difficulty would be simply to
              concede our reading of the 1949 agreement to the effect that fees on the Autobahn were
              by implication included. They might say that as a concession to relaxation of
              international tensions, they would be willing to have their experts sit down with our
              experts to decide what were the reasonable fees. We might even be willing to go so far
              as to agree that these two experts would be drawn on our nomination from the East
              German government and the West German government, respectively, but we would have to
              insist, I should think, on these experts reporting to the four Ambassadors. I should
              like to underline again what seems to me the impossibility of our agreeing to
              Pushkin’s position of yesterday, namely that we ask the Federal Republic of Germany to
              name an official who would meet with an official of the German Democratic Republic to
              decide on the extent and nature of the fees to be collected on the Autobahn.</p>
            <p>Another possibility, to which I have referred in an earlier communication to the
              Department, is to concede the right of the German Democratic Republic to be master of
              the roads in the Soviet Zone <hi rend="italic">except</hi> the three roads from the
              Federal Republic to West Berlin. (The 1949 agreement could be interpreted in this
              way.) The Russians in turn would concede 4-power responsibility for and control of
              road, rail and water transport to Berlin from the Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>In short, if the Russians really want to settle this issue, it seems to me there are
              a number of openings in the field of negotiations. It seemed quite clear from
              Pushkin’s behavior yesterday that he was under strict instructions <hi rend="italic"
                >not to</hi> reach an agreement. I suppose he was so instructed lest it be thought
              that any agreement reached in a meeting of the four Ambassadors would be the
              equivalent to a victory for our fundamental principle, namely the 4-power
              responsibility for access to Berlin, including the fees on the Autobahn.</p>
            <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, the Department has taken the initiative and
              discussed with the British and French the desirability of coordinating plans in the
              event there should be another blockade of Berlin. In our discussions we have pointed
              out that in case of a blockade we contemplate as a first step the use of limited
              military force. The British have asked us for the meaning of “limited military force”
              and, although we have not yet heard from the French, they will doubtless raise the
              same question. In response to Admiral Duncan and General <persName corresp="#p_KRB1"
                >Ridgway</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that
              the United Kingdom agreed in principle to the desirability of advance planning and
              agreed to consultation with us and the French on this subject. The British suggested
              that the discussions be postponed until after today’s meeting in Berlin. In addition,
              the British Embassy representative stated it was unlikely that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                >HMG</gloss> would commit itself in advance to any given course of action. Admiral
                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that in accordance with
              paragraph 9(f) of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, <gloss
                target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> has completed unilateral plans in the event
              of a blockade which he can implement upon direction. In his opinion the concept of
              limited use of force meant the use of small bodies of U.S. troops to test Soviet
              intentions. This was the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> intention.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> inquired as to what specifically we
              could tell the British. General <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Ridgway</persName> said he
              believed that <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>’s plans were available
              here. However, he was not clear on one important point which he felt should be
              clarified to the field commander, i.e., does limited use of force mean the use of
              firepower. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that the
                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper was clear on this since it called for
              “immediate and forceful action”. General <persName corresp="#p_KRB1"
                >Ridgway</persName> reiterated his belief that the instructions were not
              sufficiently precise whereas Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
              said again that the field commander should infer from his instructions that he could
              use firepower. He also felt we could inform the British of our plans which involved
              limited military force. General <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Ridgway</persName> again
              said he felt we were evading our responsibility because the field commander would not
              know whether he should march up to the barricade, try to tear it down, or start
              shooting.</p>
            <p>Major General Gerhart said that in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
              Board discussions of this point it had been intended that the West would undertake a
              small probing action to test Soviet intentions. This did not <pb n="383"
                xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"/>necessarily mean the use of firepower. However, if
              after this test of intentions we determined that the Soviets would not reopen access
              to Berlin then the second step (paragraph i) would come into play and force would be
              used. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he thought this
              paragraph made the intention explicit and clear. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> then asked if the Joint Chiefs could give us a brief outline of
              the meaning of “limited use of force” which we could give to the British and to the
              French also if they raise this question.</p>
            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KRB1">Ridgway</persName> stated that he would supply
              such an outline to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: In the course of a meeting with the
              Joint Chiefs of Staff on 20 May 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">See <ref
                  target="#d161">Document 161</ref>.</note> representatives of the Department of
              State requested a definition of the term “limited military force” as employed in
                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1, U.S. Policy Toward Berlin. A preliminary
              view on this subject has already been furnished to you by the Department of the
              Army.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense considers that, for the purpose of carrying out the
              military provisions of paragraph 9 f of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1,
              commitment of the following forces would constitute an appropriate interpretation of
              the expression “limited military force”: one reinforced motorized rifle platoon to
              accompany motor convoys from <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>Berlin or from
              Berlin and Helmstedt, and one reinforced rifle platoon on each train. Forces on this
              order of magnitude would be sufficient to determine definitely Soviet intentions by
              drawing Soviet fire or by otherwise compelling the Soviets to choose between
              permitting or resisting with force the passage of the U.S. forces along the
              Autobahn.</p>
            <p>If execution of the provisions of paragraph 9 f of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                >NSC</gloss> 5404/1 results in the Soviets resisting with force the attempt of the
              U.S. platoons to proceed along the Autobahn or the railroad, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                >NSC</gloss> 5404/1 provides that the platoons withdraw; that the United States
              initiate various measures to rally United States and allied opinion behind the U.S.
              position; institute certain alert measures in Europe; and an appropriate degree of
              mobilization in the Continental United States; and make clear to the USSR U.S.
              determination. Thereafter, allowing a period for Soviet reaction to these
              preparations, paragraph 9 i of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1 provides
              that the United States use limited military force again, this time to attempt to
              reopem access to Berlin, even at the risk of general war.</p>
            <p>It is not possible militarily to state the order of magnitude appropriate for the
              military force which would be employed under the provisions of paragraph 9 i of <gloss
                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1. The conditions produced by the political,
              psychological, mobilization and alert measures which would have been taken following
              the use of the reinforced platoons cannot be predicted. Only after these conditions
              were evaluated in the light of circumstances then prevailing could a sound decision be
              reached as to the size and composition of forces to be used.</p>
            <p>Execution of any plan calling for the use of military force to assist in removing
              restrictions of access to Berlin would be only on specific orders emanating from the
              highest level of the United States Government and must be explicit as to the latitude
              allowed the commander in opening fire.</p>

            <p>The conversation opened with an exchange of pleasantries after which the Secretary
              stated that he had added a sentence covering neutrality with respect to Germany in the
              proposed joint communiqué to be issued following the Chancellor’s talk with the
                President.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">The conversation took place at 11:30 a.m. on
                June 14; see <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 230–231. For text of the communiqué
                issued by the Chancellor and the President, see Department of State <hi
                  rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 27, 1955, pp. 1033–1034.</note> The Chancellor
              indicated that he was very happy to include that sentence.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor indicated that he would prefer not to discuss subjects in which he was
              interested until after the Secretary had raised matters of concern to him.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he thought that yesterday they had adequately covered the question
              of the Four Power meeting but that he believed the Chancellor might wish to raise
              certain questions in connection therewith with the President and might also wish to
              discuss with the President the subject of the Chancellor’s invitation to visit the
              Soviet Union and the question of German unification. The Secretary then referred to
              his invitation to the Chancellor to lunch with him in New York and to discuss with him
              and the British and French Foreign Ministers these various matters. The Chancellor
              expressed his appreciation for the invitation.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Berlin Autobahn Situation.</hi> The Secretary said that in his
              view, in accordance with its commitment given to the Three Powers in 1949, the Soviet
              Union has an obligation to maintain the normal conduct of traffic to and from Berlin.
              The Secretary stated that he did not believe that that undertaking wholly excluded
              exploration by the Chancellor’s Government with the authorities of East Germany as to
              what constituted normal charges that might be imposed on the Autobahn traffic. The
              Secretary said that if the tolls were arbitrary and designed to impair traffic and not
              to cover the cost of the upkeep of the Autobahn, then the question, he believed, fell
              within the sphere <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0415"/>of the 1949 agreement
              between the Four Powers. The Secretary added that, subject to concurrence in New York
              of his British and French colleagues, whose governments are parties to the same
              agreement, he hoped to mention this matter at San Francisco to Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>. He would say that he hoped that the question
              might be resolved before the Four Power meeting, which was ostensibly being held to
              minimize difficulties and this action in Berlin was creating difficulties.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor stated that he did not know whether or not the Secretary was familiar
              with the Ordinance providing for these tolls which had been issued by the German
              Democratic Republic and which referred to all roads and highways in the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as well as military vehicles. Thus the only vehicles
              which remain to be taxed were West German and West Berlin vehicles plying between West
              Germany and Berlin, which in the Chancellor’s view made the matter purely a political
              one. He added that in his view the Ordinance was not purely financial but had been
              issued to cause concern to residents of Western Germany buying in Berlin. It was
              clear, the Chancellor continued, that there was a certain amount of wear and tear on
              the highways and that the West Germans were prepared to discuss this question and pay
              justified charges. However, the Chancellor wanted to emphasize that he did not think
              the objective was financial but rather political and psychological—to scare off firms
              from buying in West Berlin. Therefore, the Chancellor would be very appreciative if
              the matter could be taken up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>,
              if the British and French Foreign Ministers agreed, as falling within the sphere of
              the 1949 agreement.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we would attempt to soften the situation up from the Soviet
              side but he hoped that the Chancellor would see to it that discussions were continued
              at the technical level also so that by working at these two levels the problem might
              be solved.</p>
            <p>The Chancellor indicated that they had not been very successful in their attempts to
              initiate talks on a technical level but they would continue to try.<note n="3"

              1954 were completed in March 1955, with the result that DM 89 million was obligated to
              the General Capital Development Program (regular long-term investment loans, risk
              investment, and loan guarantees), and DM 50 million was assigned to the Joint
              Reconstruction Program (mostly from counterpart repayments). In addition, a $200,000
              technical exchange program, <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0419"/>to increase
              productivity and including projects looking to establishment of a business school in
              Berlin, was authorized. For its part, the Federal Republic agreed to undertake certain
              additional measures of support for Berlin. Thus, during <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                >FY</gloss> 1955 there were available for allocation to projects or end-users about
              DM 340 million, consisting of about DM 202 million of the funds of previous years and
              about DM 139 million of new aid and post-Zablocki re-flows. During this period about
              DM 140 million will have been allocated to projects or end-users in conjunction with
              the long-term loan, risk investment, working capital loan, orders financing, and
              reconstruction programs.</p>
            <p>By the end of June 1955 unemployment in West Berlin had declined to about 140,000 out
              of a working force of nearly 1 million. This figure can be compared with 194,000
              unemployed at the end of June 1954. The index of industrial production was 92
              (1936=100) by the end of June 1955, a level 16 points above June 1954.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that only about 60–90,000 of those unemployed are, in fact,
              employable under present conditions and that approximately half of the employables are
              unskilled and older white collar workers. Since unemployment is still a problem in
              West Berlin, it is becoming increasingly evident that strenuous efforts will need to
              be made to attract entrepreneurs with associated management and technical personnel to
              West Berlin, which combined with relatively abundant supplies of capital can bring
              about desired increases in employment opportunities.</p>
            <p>In order to maintain the current rate of economic recovery in Berlin, the Executive
              Branch requested $21 million in new funds under Mutual Security funds for <gloss
                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956. Of this total, $15 million would be earmarked for
              private and public investment programs and reconstruction projects; $5 million for
              East Zone projects; and $1 million for technical exchange for Berlin–<gloss

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Paragraph 8d:</hi> “Continue to provide funds for

            <p>1) Youth rallies, scholarships, and interzonal travel.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">State</hi>: [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

              balances of the 1953 food and medical relief program for the support of youth rallies,
              scholarships, promotion of interzonal travel, etc. This was in accord with and
              supplementary to the $3 million program of this nature approved in June 1954. While
              the U.S. contribution to the food-package program ended in January, with the exception
              of packets for the families of the politically persecuted, the remaining funds from
              the original $15 million food program authorization are providing medical assistance
                <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0420"/>for needy East Zoners. (The <gloss
                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> has also authorized alternative use of these funds for
              the June 1954 projects.) Procedural problems under the $3 million program authorized
              June 1954 were fully worked out with the Kaiser Ministry<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3"
                >Ministry for Matters Concerning Germany As a Whole.</note> in Bonn early in 1955,
              and a wide variety of action is now underway. Some phases of the program have moved
              faster than others, for example, funds for the youth and adult contact programs were
              completely exhausted at the outset of June, while return travel funds have moved
              somewhat slower than anticipated. The Executive Branch has not requested a sum of $5
              million for further assistance to projects during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
              1956 to continue youth and adult programs and return travel. It is anticipated that
              new programs for the support of church activities and sponsoring the procurement of
              publications for the East Zone will be established.</p>

              stressed the freedom of elections and the multiplicity of candidates in West Berlin as
              opposed to tactics followed in the East Zone. It was pointed out that the Communist
              Party was allowed freely to participate in the elections, that the Communist Party had
              all the privileges of the Western Parties, free to hold meetings, distribute
              pamphlets, etc., and that police protection was provided. The Communist vote was 2.7%
              of over a million ballots.</p>

            <p>On May 11 and May 12, 1955 this question was discussed with representatives of the
              British and French Embassies respectively.<note n="4" xml:id="d167fn4">No record of
                these meetings has been found in Department of State files.</note> The question of
              the current autobahn tolls was used as a point of departure. It was explained that it
              was possible that Soviet harassment of Berlin might continue with the eventual
              initiation of a second blockade and it appeared prudent that consideration now be
              given to what action the Allies would have to take in the event that all retaliatory
              measures and diplomatic recourses produce no results. It was explained that in such a
              situation we felt that we would have to indicate to the Soviets our determination to
              remain in Berlin even if this should require possible use of some military force to
              test Soviet intentions. Consequently the Department considered that advance planning
              is in order.</p>
            <p>The Embassy representatives were asked to refer the matter to their governments and
              if the governments agreed in principle we <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"
              />would then suggest that planning be initiated among the three Ambassadors and the
              three military Commanders in West Germany and the Commandants in Berlin.</p>
            <p>The French and British representatives inquired whether we had any specific plans for
              military action in mind to which we responded that we had no specific ideas but wanted
              agreement in principle to planning such action.</p>
            <p>The French and British Governments agreed to discussions in Bonn. They also asked for
              more information as to what we had in mind in reference to possible limited use of
              force.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Ambassador (Bonn) was instructed on May 27, 1955<note n="5" xml:id="d167fn5"

            <p>3. Without attempting definitive formulation it occurs to us that certain points
              clearly belong among major considerations this general problem. For example, it will
              be essential maintain basic rights regarding free flow of air and surface traffic for
              both Allies and Germans between Berlin and Federal Republic. Also essential protect
              equally both civilian and military Allied personnel stationed Berlin. <pb n="398"
                xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"/>Assertion Allied rights must not be depreciated by
              protests made too frequently or without firm grounds. In raising any particular case
              with Soviets we must bear in mind corresponding situation our side in order avoid
              counter charge of inconsistent practice our part. In this connection we must give
              careful thought to relation this subject with status Soviet officials in Federal
              Republic after establishment diplomatic relations with Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>4. Until common policy worked out and accepted by three Powers and Germans we shall
              have to make practical decisions as individual cases arise. In considering immediate
              problem travel documentation it appears to us most important distinction is whether
              documents are issued under Soviet authority or independently by East Germans.
              Substitution Soviet visas for Soviet military permits authorizing travel Allied
              civilian officials in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> seems not necessarily
              incompatible with Soviet responsibilities under quadripartite agreements and it would
              be difficult make effective protest this ground alone as pointed out your 1254. We
              agree, however, that change in form of documentation likely to be first step in
              preparation give <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authority issue visas for Allied
              civilian officials. While undesirable acquiesce in differentiation Soviet treatment
              Allied civilian and military personnel stationed in Berlin (Berlin’s 336), do not
              believe we can refuse accept visas in place of propusks particularly in view past
              practice.</p>
            <p>5. Regarding submission travel documents to inspection by East German police (such as
              incident Hof checkpoint reported 1254), we agree this undesirable, but possible
              maintain police acting as Soviet agents. Believe principal difficulty would arise, not
              from inspection alone, but from failure East Germans honor such documents. While
                <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss> report recommends Three Powers protest such
              inspection immediately, we are not convinced protest need be made such cases unless
              East Germans refuse recognize validity documents. In event such refusal, desirability
              following suggestion your 1254 to restrict Allied civilian travel to Berlin–Helmstedt
              Autobahn (where visas and propusks not required) would be more evident than it is now.
              Unable determine from information available here whether such restriction advisable at
              this stage.</p>
            <p>6. Agree better ascertain Soviet intentions by test cases application for travel
              documents than by direct inquiry, but question whether issue should be pressed until
              tripartite position more fully defined. Assume you will keep us currently advised all
              developments and progress joint planning.</p>

            <p>After Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had briefed the Council on the contents of
              the reference Progress Report, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
              asked to be heard on the subject.</p>
            <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said it was his strong
              personal opinion, and he believed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff would probably agree
              with him, that Berlin was one area in the world where we can expect real trouble in
              the near future. Accordingly, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
              believed that the State Department should make every effort to find out the attitude
              of our allies, the British and the French, if the Soviets stirred up new difficulties
              in Berlin. They have been dragging their feet on this point and the Soviets probably
              know it and are taking advantage of their knowledge.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> expressed agreement with
              Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s anxiety, and noted that
              tension was again rising in the Soviet Zone of Germany. Certainly further harassment
              and restriction were likely to be imposed on West Berlin.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that although, as the
              Progress Report pointed out, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
              had proposed to the British and French <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"
              />Governments that the Allied Military Commanders in Berlin should jointly plan what
              to do in the event of a new blockade, there had been no response as yet from these two
              Governments. On the other hand, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                >Hoover</persName> did not feel that we could press these Governments for a response
              until after the conclusion of the Geneva Conference.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> suggested that in view of the
              urgency perhaps this issue could be discussed directly with the British and French
              Foreign Ministers at Geneva by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
              >Dulles</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> replied
              that he believed that this problem was on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                >Dulles</persName>’ Geneva agenda. He noted also that the problem had now been
              complicated by the restoration of sovereignty to the Federal Republic. Admiral
                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that in that case the U.S.
              policy statement on Berlin<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">Reference is to <gloss
                  target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1.</note> had best be reviewed by the National
              Security Council. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that
              such an undertaking would be difficult until after the Geneva Conference
              terminated.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then asked Admiral
                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> if he actually feared another Berlin
              blockade. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied in the
              affirmative, and reminded the Council of the President’s firm views with respect to
              demonstrating to the Soviets that the United States would not tolerate the
              reimposition of a blockade of Berlin. Both Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                >Radford</persName> and Dr. Flemming also noted the President’s view that if the
              Soviets started another blockade of Berlin the United States would proceed to full
              mobilization.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that this last
              feature was a rather tough policy.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Livie</hi>: A week ago I started to write you a long letter
              about the situation in Germany in general and the problem of Berlin in particular but
              just at that moment I received the news of the detention of the two Congressmen in
              East Berlin<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">Regarding the detention of Representatives
                Ostertag and Poland in the Soviet sector of Berlin on November 27, see <ref
                  target="#d223">Documents 223</ref> ff.</note> and for obvious reasons postponed my
              letter. I am afraid the events of the last week will not make my letter any briefer,
              but I do have the advantage now of reporting on an hour and a half conversation which
              I had with the Chancellor the day before yesterday (Saturday).</p>
            <p>As you already know the Chancellor is considerably disturbed about various articles
              which have appeared in United States press about the German situation and by the
              attack on the Administration’s <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>German policy
              from various sources, particularly Harriman. We in the Embassy feel that some of the
              writers and commentators on Germany are badly informed about the true situation.
              Furthermore I couldn’t help feeling from my brief conversations in Geneva<note n="3"
                xml:id="d171fn3">Conant visited Geneva on November 15 for consultations with the
                U.S. Delegation.</note> that perhaps some members of the U.S. delegation too had
              arrived at tentative conclusions which I do not think are warranted. Let me attempt,
              if I can, to analyze the general situation as we see it here in the Embassy and then
              turn to the specific problem of Berlin.</p>
            <p>If I read the critics correctly and understand the apprehensions of some members of
              the U.S. staff, the chief point of concern is that as soon as the Chancellor
              disappears from the political scene German policy will necessarily be radically
              altered. This alteration, so it is claimed, can only be in the direction of
              reconciliation with Moscow; sooner or later, it is said, the Germans will doublecross
              us by making a deal for reunification which will be at the expense of the Western
              position in general, and the U.S. position in particular. While admitting that our
              whole policy in giving the Federal Republic sovereignty and proceeding to encourage
              its rearmament within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is a calculated risk, I
              feel the pessimistic forecast of the doubting Thomases is based on two false
              assumptions: (1) that the emotional drive of the German population will within the
              foreseeable future prove to be a major political force and (2) that there is a basis
              for a “deal” between a government in Bonn and Moscow.</p>
            <p>Before analyzing the situation further, let me make it plain that I am not basing my
              optimistic forecast of the future on any such premise as “the Germans have changed”.
              If I live long enough to write anything about my experience here in the last three
              years, I shall devote a chapter to attacking such glib phrases as “the Germans have
              changed” or “the Germans haven’t changed”. Anyone who has been a college president in
              the United States for twenty years can not start from any other assumption than the
              premise that the vast majority of human beings are quite ready to doublecross their
              friends and partners if occasion arises! Therefore we can eliminate what I would call
              the sentimental argument from the discussion and get down to a prognosis of
              probabilities. When we do so, the following facts seem to emerge.</p>
            <p>At present the demand for unification is to be found in those parts of Germany where
              the division causes real economic hardship. First and foremost is Berlin, of course,
              second Hamburg, and third a number of cities and towns along the border—for example,
              the textile area around Hof. Leaving geography aside, the urge for unification is to
              be found among those Germans who have relatives in the <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403"
                facs="0431"/>East or who have hopes of re obtaining properties they have lost. This
              latter group undoubtedly includes those who were expelled from the Eastern provinces;
              but at the same time the very existence of the pressures for reopening the question of
              the Eastern territories with all the political uncertainty that that involves is one
              of the reasons why many of the native West Germans are apprehensive about the whole
              reunification issue. It is noteworthy that all political parties have soft-pedalled
              all discussion of the Eastern boundaries with the exception of the <gloss
                target="#t_BHE1">BHE</gloss> (which is disappearing). More than one German has
              spoken to me about the dynamite implicit in any public debate of this problem.
              Furthermore, the German industrialists must see that reunification would bring serious
              financial problems and taxes might well go up in order to provide for the necessary
              reconstructions. As far as the Ruhr group is concerned I have detected very little
              urgent desire for immediate reunification though, of course, they all insist that no
              one in Germany or in any other country can even suggest that the free world is
              satisfied with the present division. Quite rightly it seems to me they believe we
              should keep reunification to the forefront; for after all one can never tell what may
              develop in the international situation which will provide a favorable moment for
              pushing these claims more vigorously. Certainly the owners of property and managers of
              industry have no stomach for taking the risk of living in a unified Germany where any
              of the Pankow crowd are likely to have a voice. They are worried about the political
              and economic consequence of even a <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>/<gloss
                target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> coalition government.</p>
            <p>Let me consider a little further what possible deals might be made assuming the worst
              about a German government in Bonn. A deal involving the Pankow crowd coming into the
              government seems to me out of the question for the reasons I have just given. A deal
              permitting either free elections or the sovereignty of Bonn to extend over the Soviet
              Zone would seem to me only conceivable at the price of the United States troops
              withdrawing from Germany and Bonn accepting enforced neutrality. The number of real
              neutralists who have advocated such a deal today is limited to the group of
              intellectuals and their followers, led by Heinemann. The leaders of the <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> at lunch the other day (Ollenhauer, Erler, Wehner)
              assured me that they would never agree to a unification on the basis of American
              troops going home. All they had ever advocated they maintained was an agreement
              between Russia and the United States in a security system which might involve the
              change of American troop disposal, but to leave Germany unprotected and with no
              European security system was far from their thoughts indeed. (I wish they would say
              this publicly and I also wish somebody would banish the words “security system” but
              that is another subject.)</p>
            <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0432"/>
            <p>As for the stability of the present government in Bonn, quite apart from the
              Chancellor’s health, I think you should realize that his party holds an important card
              which has not yet been played. The Chancellor referred to this in our conversation on
              Saturday. It involves the electoral law which must be passed by the Bundestag before
              the 1957 election. If this law were to be one in which proportioned representation
              were eliminated and strictly majority voting the rule, his party together with the
                <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> might well obtain a two-thirds majority. The
                <gloss target="#t_FDP1">FDP</gloss> would almost be eliminated (leaders of this
              party have expressed their anxiety on this score to me) and the <gloss
                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> representation in the Bundestag would almost certainly
              be reduced. I am passing no judgment on the ethics of such a change in the electoral
              law but the fact is that in terms of the American system of elections, the
              Chancellor’s parties (<gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CSU1"
                >CSU</gloss>) are much stronger than the present composition of the Bundestag
              indicates.</p>
            <p>My relatively optimistic forecast for the foreseeable future here in Germany rests on
              two assumptions which I want to underline. The first is a continuation of full
              employment and the other is demonstration that the free world is strong enough to meet
              any challenge the Soviets may make. As to the first point I do not agree that a mere
              recession from the present boom would constitute a serious threat but only if the
              recession led to considerable unemployment. This I judge to be unlikely unless the
              whole economy of the free world should undergo a very severe depression. You will know
              better than I how to appraise this possibility.</p>
            <p>It is the second assumption that I want to underline and discuss at some length in
              the balance of this letter. Undoubtedly, if the leaders of any of the major parties or
              leading people in industrial circles became convinced that the United States was going
              to pull out of Europe or was unable to protect our present forward positions, then a
              scramble for a personal reconciliation with Moscow might result. This is particularly
              true in the forward exposed areas along the border and above all in Berlin. Thus, I
              come to the conclusion that our position in respect to Berlin is a key to the problem
              of the future of the U.S. policy in Germany. To take an extreme case, if we were
              forced to leave Berlin, or in order to stay were forced to urge Bonn to negotiate with
              Pankow, then my optimism about the future is extremely limited for after all a Pankow
              government which was tolerated by the West and received a de facto recognition from
              Bonn would be in a very strong position to push its views on Western Germany. That the
              Soviet Zone is already being used as a forward bastion for disturbing the economic and
              political situation in the Federal Republic is quite obvious, but all these attempts
              can be met and defeated, I believe, on the one assumption that the United States,
              Great Britain and France and the Federal Republic remain <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405"
                facs="0433"/>united and react powerfully to the challenges which are bound to come
              in connection with Berlin.</p>
            <p>Let me try to be specific about what I think is needed in regard to Berlin and what I
              hope can be accomplished in the not too distant future. The approach outlined in the
              Instruction of August 23 (<gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>–1536)<note n="4"
                xml:id="d171fn4"><gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>–1536 outlined the possible
                courses of action available to the Western Powers on the question of tolls and
                concluded that diplomatic protests were “much less likely to induce the Communists
                to change their blackmail tactics than demonstrating by countermeasures that it does
                not pay” (Department of State, Central Files, 962A.7162B/8–2355)</note> by the
              Department seems to us to require amendment in two regards. (You will recall it was
              impossible to proceed as instructed at the time because of the British and French
              position.) The amendments involve first, an elimination of the idea that the <gloss
                target="#t_IZT1">IZT</gloss> counter-measures can be applied piecemeal. The second
              is the idea that the German countermeasures must be in effect before <gloss
                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> cooperation can be obtained. I think the experience
              of last spring with the autobahn shows the difficulties of trying to put pressure on
              the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> without taking the case to the public. It also
              shows that the minor inconveniences caused by partial measures were not successful.
              According to our views here what is required is both a public demonstration that the
              Three Western Powers mean business in regard to free access to Berlin and secondly a
              public trade embargo in cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
              countries. What I hope is that in this new committee which is being set up to study
              the documentation of travel, etc., it will be possible for the United States, British,
              French and Federal Republic representations to agree on a series of operations which
              would go into effect if and when there were further serious difficulties in regard to
              access to Berlin. These plans would, according to our view, have to be discussed with
              the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries and the Three Western Powers
              would have to agree to go into the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> meeting
              prepared to support the plan. Furthermore, I would hope that a knowledge of these
              plans would leak to the Russians and a knowledge of their existence might prove to be
              the greatest deterrent to action by the Soviets. Or I might even go so far as to say
              that by oral statements the Ambassadors in Moscow should let the Russians know plainly
              that we are prepared for very strong measures if they tried to use access to Berlin as
              a mode of promoting recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but I am
              not prepared to push this recommendation, until we are agreed on the plans.</p>
            <p>As an illustration of what I have in mind let me set forth my own ideas as to what
              should be agreed on in advance in regard to the situation which would arise if an
              announcement were made that hereafter no more German trains would be cleared for
              Berlin, unless <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0434"/>the Minister of Transport at
              Bonn would meet with the Minister of Transport of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose that this statement were made and followed up by actual stoppage of
              the trains by the Volkspolizei and let us further assume that this action did not
              affect the allied trains. I would advocate that the following steps be taken at once: <list>
                <label>(a)</label>
                <item>Strong protest to Pushkin followed within days by protest to Moscow.</item>
                <label>(b)</label>
                <item>An increase in the number of military trains and their use for transporting
                  essential materials for the Berlin economy both ways. (I know the Army will raise
                  their objections on the basis of established procedures, but that objection must
                  be overcome.) I assume further that the Russians would then try to stop our trains
                  and this would result in a series of dramatic episodes. What is needed at this
                  point is headline stories for several days. At this point and only at this point
                  do I believe the Federal Republic would be prepared to put on a public trade
                  embargo assuming they would have the full cooperation of the <gloss
                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>If this were all done, the Soviet Zone would undoubtedly retaliate by cutting off the
              brown coal supply. Therefore we would be in the midst of a trade war and also a very
              tense situation in Berlin. It might be necessary to establish again an airlift, but
              with this airlift, our stockpile and the pressures put on the Soviet Union by the
              embargo, I should hope we would win out, though it might take time. The alternative
              let me remind you would be to tell the Bonn government it must deal at the ministerial
              level with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. In my humble opinion the day we do
              that we might as well leave Berlin and not many months later we might as well retire
              from Europe too.</p>
            <p>In order to understand the reluctance of the Germans to carry on a partial embargo
              against the Soviet Zone, you must understand that they are convinced that they are
              very dependent on the brown coal from the Zone. This was made clear by the Chancellor
              last Saturday. Though it is equally clear that they are prepared to take on this
              hardship when the Three Western Powers on their side are willing to show that they are
              in earnest about any interference with access to Berlin. The difficulty last spring in
              connection with the autobahn tolls was that the Three Western Powers were not willing
              even to make a public protest to Moscow, you may recall. Regardless of the merits of
              this position which I appreciate was determined by a number of special factors (e.g.
              British elections), the Germans interpret it as passing the responsibility to them. In
              short the Germans will be willing to do their part but they will insist that there be
              strong pressure put on Moscow by the Three Western Allies and in as public a way as
              possible. This seems to me not an unreasonable position for them to take.</p>
            <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0435"/>
            <p>I think I should report two or three further facts which will help you to appraise
              the situation here. In the first place, at the Cabinet meeting last Wednesday
              according to Professor Hallstein several members spoke pretty strongly about the need
              for vigorous allied protests in connection with the detention of the Congressmen and
              Dibrova’s subsequent statement. Rather unpleasant allusions were made to the lack of
              firmness of the allies in connection with the autobahn. Secondly, Professor Hallstein,
              Von Brentano and the Chancellor have each separately referred to the legend about
              General Clay’s desire to break the Berlin blockade by force.<note n="5"
                xml:id="d171fn5">Regarding Clay’s views on the sending of an armed convoy to Berlin
                in 1948 to break the blockade, see <ref target="frus1948v02#pg_958"><hi
                    rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi>, 1948, vol. II, p. 958</ref>, or

                735–738.</note> There seems to be a fixed belief on the part of the leading Germans
              of all parties in Bonn and in Berlin that Clay wanted to send a convoy under armed
              escort through the blockade and was ordered not to do so by Washington. What is more
              important is the fact they are all convinced that if he had done this the Russians
              would never have opened fire and there never would have been an airlift. As far as my
              information goes this is a legend and I believe a dangerous one. But it is symptomatic
              of the German belief that the Three Western Powers must show their strength if we are
              to remain in Berlin. With this I agree.</p>

              <label>I.</label>
              <item>This is a proposal to counter recent Soviet moves in East Berlin which dramatize
                the Soviet contention that Berlin is no longer subject to four-power control, and
                that postwar agreements relating to freedom of the city and to the rights of the
                Western Allies throughout the city are invalid. There are other possibilities,
                obviously. This one would require a willingness to face up to the real issue of
                principle in a bold, dramatic way; it would require coordination <pb n="408"
                  xml:id="pg_408" facs="0436"/>with our allies in Berlin, which may be impossible of
                attainment.</item>
              <label>II.</label>
              <item>It is suggested that the merits of the following plan be examined: <list>
                  <label>1.</label>
                  <item>In the British sector of West Berlin, a few hundred yards from the
                    Brandenburger Gate, which is at the Soviet Sector line, there is located an
                    imposing Soviet war memorial erected in 1945, at the time the Soviets were in
                    sole occupation of Berlin. It is manned by three or four armed Soviet guards,
                    who are relieved at regular intervals. The British authorities in Berlin have
                    permitted Soviet control of this monument since the end of the war.</item>
                  <label>2.</label>
                  <item>At an early date, on the occasion of the changing of the guard, the Soviet
                    jeep carrying the relief guards from East Berlin could be stopped at the
                    Brandenburger Gate by West Berlin police. This would require ten or twelve
                    heavily armed policemen, a so-called “Bereitschaftseinheit,” i.e., a riot-squad.
                    The Soviet officer in charge would be told that the bearing of arms by
                    foreigners in West Berlin was illegal, unless the arms were registered with the
                    police, or a general agreement had been entered into. This would presumably
                    result in a check by the Soviet officer with his superiors. It is doubtful that
                    the Soviets would be prepared to shoot their way into West Berlin.</item>
                  <label>3.</label>
                  <item>The Soviet Commandant in Berlin would undoubtedly immediately protest to the
                    British Commandant, who could express his full sympathy with this obvious
                    violation of the rights of the Occupation authorities in the four-power city,
                    and indicate that he would be prepared to take the matter up with his colleagues
                    In the Kommandatura, and with the German authorities, giving the impression that
                    he was in no hurry. He could also point out that several incidents of this
                    nature had recently occurred in Berlin, alluding to the recent arrest of an
                    American group in East Berlin, when German police insisted that the two-way
                    radio in a US Army automobile was illegal under East German law.</item>
                  <label>4.</label>
                  <item>Since the matter of the Soviet War Memorial in the British sector goes to
                    the heart of Soviet prestige, it could be expected that the Soviet authorities
                    would be under pressure to liquidate the incident as rapidly as possible. The
                    Western powers would constantly indicate that they were prepared to settle it
                    only on the basis of reaffirmation of the principle of four-power responsibility
                    for all Berlin, and of the rights of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Occupation
                    Authorities in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> parts of the city.</item>
                  <label>5.</label>
                  <item>There are obvious difficulties in the proposal. West Berlin authorities
                    would have to be willing to engage in the demonstration. Our allies in Berlin
                    would have to be convinced of the utility of making an issue of the matter in a
                    dramatic way. The possibilities of reprisal against the Berlin population, such
                    as new controls on circulation <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"
                    />throughout the city, slow-down on the autobahn, etc., must be weighed. The
                    timing may be undesirable for any number of reasons. But it would appear to be
                    useful to examine the practicability of matching recent Soviet moves by one in
                    the same category.</item>

              West Berlin police in order to counter recent Soviet moves in Berlin. We are grateful
              for your interest, and I am writing to give you one or two thoughts concerning your
              suggestion.</p>
            <p>As you indicate, the location of the Soviet War Memorial in the British Sector of
              Berlin does afford the possibility for exerting some form of counter-pressure against
              the Soviets should an appropriate occasion arise. This possibility has in fact been
              considered in connection with our planning on counter-measures. However, it does not
              seem to us that the present situation in Berlin is such as to call for the kind of
              action you describe. The fact that it was the Soviet authorities who released the two
              American soldiers recently arrested by the East German police shows that the Soviets
              (to that extent and for the present, at least) are willing to act consistently with
              our view as to their continued occupation responsibilities in Berlin. We doubt whether
              this is the time to precipitate a possibly critical situation by taking action which
              would doubtless be regarded as provocative.</p>

              French support this position so that military planning can be undertaken on tripartite
              basis. It should be explained to French that while situation relatively quiet in
              Berlin now it would not be safe to assume it will remain so. Western Powers have
              publicly committed themselves on repeated occasions to maintain their position in
              Berlin. They cannot allow themselves to be pushed out without most serious damage to
              entire international position vis-à-vis Soviet Union. There are no present indications
              that Soviets prepared resort severe or far-reaching measures affecting Western
              position Berlin either themselves or through <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> but
              possibility cannot be completely excluded. If emergency were to arise it would come

            <p>Minister Kaiser said that he is deeply disturbed by the constant flow of refugees
              from the Soviet Zone. Mr. <persName>Kaiser</persName> would prefer to have active
              anti-communists stay in the Soviet Zone and maintain some sort of passive resistance
              to Pankow’s regime. Mr. <persName>Kaiser</persName> claimed that Moscow and Pankow
              disagree on refugee problem; Moscow allegedly favors settling people from various
              nations under Soviet control in Soviet Zone of Germany to take the place of the
              Germans fleeing to the West, whereas Pankow would prefer to keep its German subjects.
              According to Mr. <persName>Kaiser</persName>, the Federal Government can keep
              anti-communists in the Soviet Zone if Bonn does everything in its power to keep alive
              the hope of reunification.</p>
            <p>Minister Kaiser stated that Pankow tells peasants who received land from the estates
              of the former East German nobility, that in case of reunification on the terms of the
              Bonn Government, the big estates will be given back to the former owners and the
              peasants will lose their land. Minister Kaiser would like the Federal Government to
              state clearly that it does not intend to reestablish the old estates in the East.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Kaiser</persName> said that in 1945 American troops could have walked
              into Berlin without any loss of lives. If they had done so, many of the present
              problems could have been avoided.</p>
            <p>Minister Kaiser stated that he was opposed to permitting the Soviets to send an
              ambassador to Bonn and that he had warned Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                >Adenauer</persName> against such a move.</p>

                >CDU</gloss>), and Acting Mayor Amrehn which turned mostly on the coalition crisis
              in Berlin. Neumann and Lemmer assured the Under Secretary that the current crisis will
              be settled and that West Berlin will have a stable government.</p>

            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>Though recent Communist statements and actions affecting Berlin carry an
                implicit challenge to the Four Power status of the city, we believe that the USSR
                will not now attempt to force the Western Powers out of Berlin. The present Soviet
                objective is probably limited to bringing about recognition of the East German
                regime. (Paras. 5, 14–15)</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>In seeking to achieve this objective, the USSR can employ a wide range of
                actions designed to force West Germany and the Western Powers to deal with the East
                German regime. These actions could include East German infringements of Allied
                rights of occupation and access, obstruction of the movement of Allied and German
                persons and goods, and interference in the civil order of the Western sectors.
                (Paras. 6, 9–11, 18)</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Since the Soviet leaders probably believe that severe pressure in Berlin would
                frustrate their present objectives both in Germany and in the world political
                contest generally, we believe that they will exercise care to prevent a major
                crisis. We believe the USSR may attempt <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>to
                transfer control functions over Allied civilian activities to East German
                authorities but will retain control over matters directly concerned with the
                military occupation status of Berlin and Allied military access thereto. (Paras.
                13–14, 16, 19–20)</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>The danger of serious incidents in Berlin will remain, however, particularly if
                the Soviet leaders come to estimate that the present political and military risks of
                aggressive action in Berlin have been reduced by a serious deterioration in Western
                strength and determination.<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2"><p>The Director of
                    Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, believes that paragrapn 4

                  <p>The danger of serious incidents in Berlin will remain however. Extensive Soviet
                    strengths will be retained in the area which could be used easily for harsh
                    actions against the Western position in Berlin. The USSR might risk such harsh
                    action at any time, particularly if there were any obvious serious deterioration
                    of Western political and psychological strengths in Europe or a commitment of
                    Western strengths elsewhere that Soviet leaders might hope to divert. [Footnote

              <item>Developments in Soviet-East German relations and recent incidents in Berlin
                raise the possibility of a renewed Communist effort to change the status quo in
                Berlin. In particular, by the Soviet-East German treaty of 20 September 1955, and
                its associated documents, the USSR has laid the groundwork for transferring to the
                East German regime authority over the Soviet sector of Berlin and over access to the
                city. The USSR is thus in a position to disavow both its obligations under the Four
                Power agreements and its responsibility for acts which the East German regime might
                take. Although the Soviet-East German agreements represent a Soviet effort to create
                a new legal situation, the actual situation in Berlin remains essentially unchanged,
                with rights of Allied occupation being observed and with access to Berlin being
                handled much as before.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>However, progressive application of the provisions of the Soviet-East German
                agreements could be used by the USSR to bring pressure on the other occupying Powers
                and West Germany to deal directly with the East German regime. If in these
                circumstances the Western Powers refuse to deal with the East German regime, the
                difficulty of maintaining their position in Berlin could be aggravated. 611.
                Communist Capabilities With Respect to Berlin</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>The Communists have extensive capabilities to bring pressure on the Western
                position in Berlin by employing a variety of military, economic, administrative, and
                subversive means.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0444"/>
            <list>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>Communist armed forces far outnumber those of the West in the Berlin area and
                the Communists could seize the Western sectors at any time. The three Western Powers
                have in Berlin only a token force of approximately 7,000 combat troops. The 16,000
                man West Berlin police force is only lightly armed. As against this, the USSR has
                two regiments permanently stationed on the outskirts of Berlin, and major elements
                of three Soviet mechanized armies within a few hours’ march of the city. In
                addition, there is an East German mechanized division in the immediate vicinity, as
                well as some 17,000 militarized security troops.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>West Berlin is also economically vulnerable to Communist harassment. Located 110
                miles inside East Germany and largely isolated from surrounding Communist territory,
                West Berlin depends for its economic survival upon regular movements of goods to and
                from West Germany.<note n="4" xml:id="d178fn4">West Berlin’s stockpiles of food and
                  fuel are now sufficient to sustain the city for about a year. [Footnote in the
                  source text.]</note> Virtually all of these goods are carried by road, rail, and
                water transport. Communist capabilities to harass or interdict these facilities
                range all the way from minor administrative harassment to imposing a total land
                blockade. As examples of intermediate steps to serve particular purposes, the
                Communists could block the shipment of certain West Berlin exports in order to
                reduce West German confidence in the ability of Berlin’s industry to maintain
                deliveries, or could interfere in varying degrees with West Berlin’s postal and
                telecommunications facilities.</item>
              <label>10.</label>
              <item>The Communists could interfere with Western air movements to and from West
                Berlin by: (a) direct attack upon Western aircraft, and (b) measures short of such
                attack. In the latter instance a principal Communist effort would probably be
                directed toward jamming of Allied communications. Such jamming of Western radar and
                radio would, especially under night and adverse weather conditions, make corridor
                air traffic hazardous and impair Western ability to perform air lift operations in
                the Berlin area.</item>
              <label>11.</label>
              <item>The Communists could also exploit the physical arrangements within the city to
                harass the Western Powers, to complicate the functioning of civil government in the
                Western sectors, and to confront the Western Powers with serious political problems.
                The East Germans could take advantage of the relatively free access to the Western
                sectors to incite mass demonstrations, to create public disorders, and to generate a
                feeling of insecurity through such actions as sabotage or kidnapping. As part of
                such a war of nerves or as a means of testing Western determination, the East
                Germans could infiltrate armed groups into the West Berlin area. The Communists
                could also interfere with the few utilities which still serve both parts <pb n="417"
                  xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>of the city. By severing the two city-wide transport
                systems and by imposing tight controls along the border between East and West
                Berlin, the Communists could substantially reduce the number of East German refugees
                able to reach West Berlin, and increase the isolation of the Western sectors.</item>

              <item>The long-range Soviet objective is to achieve a Western withdrawal from Berlin.
                The Western presence in Berlin is clearly inconsistent with the consolidation of
                Communist control over East Germany and threatens the prestige and security of the
                East German regime. [<hi rend="italic">6-1/2 lines of source text not

              <label>13.</label>
              <item>However, we believe that there are important limitations on the price the Soviet
                leaders would pay for control over all Berlin. They almost certainly do not now
                regard the elimination of the Western Powers from Berlin as warranting the risk of
                general war or of undermining their present pose of peaceful intent throughout the
                world.</item>
              <label>14.</label>
              <item>Moreover, the USSR almost certainly recognizes that forceful measures against
                the Western position in Berlin would adversely affect the achievement of short-term
                Soviet objectives for Germany as a whole. Over the past year, the USSR has
                established diplomatic relations with West Germany and has attempted to place the
                German question within the framework of intra-German discussions. For the present,
                Soviet policy appears based on the premise of a divided Germany, and aims at
                achieving international recognition for the East German regime. The Soviet leaders
                appear to believe that this aim can be furthered by creating situations which would
                cause the West German government to deal directly with the East German
                regime.</item>
              <label>15.</label>
              <item>We believe that current Communist moves in Berlin are intended to reinforce this
                general line of policy. Communist statements and actions in the Berlin area strongly
                indicate that the present Soviet intent is to induce the West German government to
                negotiate directly with East Germany on the ministerial level and thus to establish
                a form of de facto recognition.</item>

                    and create economic as well as political problems, it would also have its
                    disadvantages for the Communists. Such a policy would obstruct East Germany’s
                    objective of increasing its contacts with West Germany. Moreover, the
                    possibility of various Western countermeasures which would aggravate East German
                    economic difficulties would exist, including denial of transportation routes
                    through West Germany, a West German embargo on interzonal shipments, and perhaps
                    even stiffened Western trade controls.</item>

              <item>Although we believe that the above limitations will act as a brake on Communist
                actions in Berlin, the danger of serious incidents will remain, particularly if the

              <item>As indicated in the preceding section, we believe that the USSR will not now
                attempt to force the Western Powers out of Berlin. However, West Berlin’s isolated
                position places a very wide range of actions at the disposal of the Communists in
                seeking to reach the more limited objectives they now have, and it is likely that a
                variety of pressures will be generally maintained and from time to time increased.
                The nature and extent of Western responses to these pressures will in turn influence
                the further development of Communist activity vis-à-vis Berlin.</item>
              <label>19.</label>
              <item>We believe that the USSR will attempt to transfer to East Germany more and more
                authority over West German and Allied civilian access to Berlin and over East Berlin
                itself. We believe that the Communists may attempt to distinguish between Allied
                military and Allied civilian activities, and to transfer control functions over the
                latter to East German authorities. They may, for example, refuse to permit Allied
                civilians to proceed to and from Berlin by road or rail solely on Allied movement
                orders and require them to possess East German authorization as well. If the USSR is
                successful in transferring to the East German regime control functions over Allied
                civilian activities, it might be encouraged to attempt more extensive infringements
                of Allied rights.</item>
              <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>
              <label>20.</label>
              <item>However, the USSR is unlikely to denounce the Four Power agreements concerning
                Berlin. In particular, we believe that the USSR will retain control over matters
                directly concerned with the military occupation status of Berlin and Allied military
                access thereto.</item>
              <label>21.</label>
              <item>The strongest and most direct pressures will probably be brought to bear upon
                the West Germans and West Berliners. The Communists will probably continue to harass
                and delay West German truck traffic by a variety of impediments. Similar tactics
                will probably be applied to rail and barge communications between West Germany and
                Berlin. The people and authorities in West Berlin will probably also be subjected to
                various acts of intimidation and embarrassment. Such measures would be intended not
                only to undermine morale in West Berlin, but to bring pressure upon the West Germans
                to reach a settlement with the East German regime. The East Germans will probably
                also impose tighter restrictions on passage between the Eastern and Western sectors
                of Berlin in an attempt to reduce the flow of refugees, although this border will
                probably not be completely closed.</item>

              <p>The granting of sovereignty to West Germany has not altered the special status of
                West Berlin or the international legal situation with regard to access to Berlin.
                Matters pertaining to Berlin are a reserved power retained by the US, the UK, and
                France in the treaty granting West Germany sovereignty.</p>
              <p><hi rend="italic">Soviet Position.</hi> The legal structure on which the Western
                position is based has been seriously challenged only once by the USSR. In July 1948
                the Soviet government asserted that the Western Powers had forfeited their right to
                be in Berlin because they had violated the major Four Power agreements on Germany
                and thus voided the basic agreements on Berlin since these were an inseparable part
                of the over-all arrangements for Germany. After the lifting of the blockade and
                restoration of the status quo the issue remained dormant until 20 September 1955
                when a treaty granting East Germany full sovereignty was concluded between the
                Soviet and East German governments.</p>

              <p>6c. Control over Allied military movement between West Berlin and the Federal
                Republic over the established air and land routes should be retained by the USSR
                “temporarily, until an appropriate agreement is concluded.”</p>
              <p>Although the Soviet-East German agreements represent a Soviet effort to create a
                new legal situation, since the transfer of responsibility <pb n="421"
                  xml:id="pg_421" facs="0449"/>to East Germany contravenes the obligation assumed by
                the USSR in June 1949 as well as several Allied Control Council agreements on Berlin
                access, the actual situation remains essentially much as it was before 20 September
                1955. The East German authorities have in practice long exercised control over
                German traffic moving by rail, road, and water between West Berlin and West Germany.
                Moreover, in actual practice the Soviet authorities continue to control Allied
                civilian as well as military traffic.</p>
              <p>The current Soviet position on the Four Power status of Berlin is not completely
                clear. The USSR vested East Germany with control functions “within Berlin” in the
                Bolz–Zorin exchange; Soviet representatives in Germany have recently asserted that
                East German law is applicable in East Berlin; and East German propaganda has accused
                the Western Powers of destroying the Four Power status of the city. Nevertheless,
                East Berlin has not been formally integrated into East Germany. In fact, the special
                status is still being observed.</p>
              <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Access</hi></p>
              <p>The principal vulnerability of West Berlin and Allied personnel in Berlin to
                Communist pressure stems from the fact that all goods and persons moving between
                West Berlin and West Germany must cross at least 110 miles of Communist-controlled
                territory. Moreover, all movement must take place on certain designated routes. At
                present, traffic is moving over all the designated routes without significant
                restrictions; postal, radio, and telecommunications as well are not being subjected
                to interference.</p>
              <p><hi rend="italic">Road.</hi> There are four roads which are currently being used
                for highway traffic between West Berlin and West Germany: Berlin–Hamburg,
                Berlin–Helmstedt, Berlin–Gera–Wartha, and Berlin–Hof. In 1954 these roads carried 41
                percent of the total freight tonnage moving into West Berlin and 56 percent of the
                outgoing tonnage.</p>
              <p>The most important of these highways is the Berlin–Helmstedt Autobahn. This road
                not only carries the major part of the freight and vehicular traffic but is also the
                only highway Allied personnel can use without obtaining prior Soviet permission.</p>
              <p>Allied use of the Autobahn derives from the decision of the American, British, and
                Soviet commands in June 1945 to make this road available to the American and British
                forces. The Soviet commitment to maintain West German road access to Berlin does not
                specify particular highway routes.</p>
              <p><hi rend="italic">Rail.</hi> Transportation by rail between West Berlin and West
                Germany in 1954 accounted for 35 percent of the inbound and 19 percent of the
                outbound freight tonnage. All Allied freight and passenger trains as well as all
                inbound German freight trains and some German passenger trains use the
                Berlin–Helmstedt rail line. The use <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>of this
                line was established by the June 1945 agreement and subsequently in the Allied
                Control Council. Additional rail lines are available for outbound freight and German
                passenger traffic to and from West Berlin through direct agreement between the East
                and West German railroad authorities. The East German l facilities in the Soviet
                Zone and Berlin, and all rolling stock transiting the Soviet zone is hauled by East
                German locomotives.</p>
              <p><hi rend="italic">Waterways.</hi> Berlin is at the hub of an extensive canal and
                river network. Twenty-three percent of all inbound and 18 percent of all outbound
                freight tonnage was moved by barge in 1954.</p>
              <p>In May 1951 the Soviet and British authorities agreed on control arrangements for
                interzonal barge traffic. This agreement was renewed annually until the end of 1954
                when the Soviet authorities permitted it to lapse and referred the matter to the
                East Germans. Nevertheless, the validity of the barge permits issued on the basis of
                the May 1951 agreement continued to be recognized; in fact, the Soviet authorities
                continued to discharge their functions under the terms of the expired agreement. In
                October 1955 the Soviet authorities notified the British that thenceforth the East
                Germans would exercise control functions. The British in October 1955 transferred
                their control functions to the West German authorities. While applications for new
                barge permits pending at the time were returned, the validity of existent permits
                continues to remain unchallenged.</p>
              <p><hi rend="italic">Air.</hi> All Allied planes use three corridors in flying into
                and out of West Berlin: Berlin–Hamburg, Berlin–Hannover, and Berlin–Frankfurt. These
                corridors were established by the American, British, and Soviet military commands in
                June 1945 and subsequently confirmed in the Allied Control Council. In addition a
                quadripartite Berlin Air Safety Center was established in West Berlin. Its principal
                function is to act as a channel for communicating Western flight plans to the Soviet
                authorities.</p>
              <p>Air access to Berlin is of particular importance because it is the only means of
                transportation which can be used by persons who are politically endangered, such as
                East German refugees. Also, it enables the transport of goods out of West Berlin
                which the Communists will not allow to be shipped by surface transportation. Air
                movement is probably anchored more firmly in quadripartite decisions on Berlin
                access than the other forms of transport. It has in the past been subject to a
                minimum of Soviet interference.</p>
              <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Internal Situation</hi></p>
              <p>The West Berlin economy and population are not dependent to any large extent on the
                surrounding Communist-controlled territory. Within Berlin only the subway and the
                elevated system still operate <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0451"/>on a
                city-wide basis and with regard to other utilities only the disposal of West
                Berlin’s sewage depends on East Berlin’s cooperation.</p>
              <p>Practically all movement by West Berliners into the adjacent Soviet zone is
                blocked. Intracity movement, however, is still relatively unobstructed although all
                crossing points on the sector boundary between East and West Berlin have from time
                to time been either partially or completely closed by the East German
                authorities.</p>

                    another type of Communist threat to Berlin is reflected in recent intelligence
                    reports pointing to the possibility of action by the East Germans at an early
                    date to close the inter-sector borders in Berlin and physically isolate the
                    Western sectors from East Berlin. Such a development would not only have a
                    definitely harmful effect on the morale of the West Berlin population but, more
                    significantly, would greatly impair the value of West Berlin as a point of
                    contact with the West for the population of the Soviet Zone. The existence of
                    this threat calls for consideration of the measures to be taken in the event of
                    such a development, as well as to whether any action could be taken to prevent

                    retaliating in kind against Communist economic pressures against Berlin leave
                    much to be desired. Despite strong representations to the Germans on two

                  between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Berlin pertaining to
                  military forces of U.S., U.K. and French in Berlin, both by Autobahn and rail,

                <item>Re Autobahn, he added that military convoys must also have proper
                  documentation and that control would be exercised over passengers in cars. He
                  alluded to <gloss target="#t_ACA1">ACA</gloss> document dated 30 August 1945<note
                    n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">Not further identified.</note> which he said showed that
                  volume of transport on Autobahn would be insignificant, and that railway would be
                  used for heavy traffic. He added that more than 50 per cent of all transportation
                  was being moved over Autobahn. As far as passengers were concerned, travel orders
                  issued by Allies were appropriate only for representatives of military forces.
                  However, such documents were also being issued to persons having no right to them.
                  Recent example cited of French woman civilian traveling on by automobile under
                  French military orders who admitted permanent residence in Berlin and that she was
                  traveling on tourist status for tourist reasons. In future, such people will not
                  be passed.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>French political adviser said that, while procedures which have been followed
              successfully in past by Allies were not put in writing, they were based on mutual
              understanding and agreement as to their propriety. Normal mode of conduct if Soviets
              desire to make procedural change would be to request Allied agreement thereto in
              orderly discussions, rather than to try to change on spot without warning. Therefore,
              he again asked that Soviet authorities in Marienborn be instructed to suspend new
              measures. He added that problems raised by Kotsiuba statement were numerous and very
              serious, and should not be presented to Allies as fait accompli.</p>
            <p>To this Kotsiuba responded that procedures of control were entirely matter for
              Soviets who had right to change them as they wished. No mutual agreement to their
              change was necessary. Soviet Commander at Marienborn had simply been informed that
              such controls were to go into effect. Kotsiuba then irrelevantly queried why <pb
                n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0460"/>French had issued travel orders for Autobahn to
              person who had nothing to do with military authority. Procedure which he had described
              was in effect and would be adhered to. This applied to Autobahn as well. He then
              attempted summarize procedures for Autobahn and railroad: (1) persons who are
              authorized to travel are those belonging to West Berlin military garrison; (2)
              commanders of trains and commanders of convoys as well as passengers in cars must
              present proper documents proving that all passengers belong to military garrison; (3)
              no question being raised by Soviets as to number of trains or as to limiting Autobahn
              traffic. They are merely concerned that connection of West with Berlin should be
              utilized properly and lawfully.</p>
            <p>He continued that Soviets had nothing against documentation being presented by
              American and French train commanders. While exception had been made last two nights
              for British trains, he would have to ask British to adopt same procedure immediately.
              If they did this, all would be well.</p>
            <p>Point then made by political advisers that, apart from documentation itself, two
              important issues raised by Kotsiuba to which Allies could not agree were boarding of
              trains by Soviets and Soviet claim to pass judgment as to whether documentation should
              have been issued to specific individuals by Allied authorities. Kotsiuba completely
              ignored question of boarding trains, but stressed again that Allied trains had to be
              used for transportation of military garrison or of U.S., British or French nationals
              who are dependents or members of military garrison. Military documentation should be
              issued only to these categories; others should proceed to Berlin on other
              documentation. To this, political advisers made point that if Western Allies issued
              travel orders, that in itself should conclusively establish that persons concerned
              were traveling in connection with military occupation. Here Kotsiuba again dragged out
              his case of French woman residing in Berlin, traveling under French military orders
              for tourist purposes.</p>
            <p>British political adviser then raised special problem of British train. He said that
              British Commander in Helmstedt had no authority to agree to change in procedure in
              effect for many years. Soviet Commander in Marienborn had been informed to this
              effect. Yet procedures were changed without Soviets having raised question elsewhere.
              Practice followed by British had not caused Soviets to complain during period of 10
              years. If Kotsiuba insisted that such a change be made, this could only be reported to
              British superiors for consideration. He therefore requested that orders be issued to
              the Soviet Commander at Marienborn to permit British train to pass at least for time

            <p>Kotsiuba responded that new orders were in effect and that they would be enforced. He
              could not rescind them for British. However, application of stricter procedures on
              Autobahn would be held up for period of two or three days.</p>
            <p>Political advisers concluded discussion by saying they would have to reserve position
              on all points of principle raised, and would report Kotsiuba statements to their

              frequently added a new twist. For example, each statement he made re who was entitled
              to military travel orders differed slightly from previous one. At one point he implied

                    assistance from the United States and the Federal Republic has finally succeeded
                    in raising industrial production in Berlin to the 1936 level (1936—100; West
                    Germany, June 1956—210; Berlin, June 1956—100). Unemployment has been reduced
                    below 100,000. Both these developments represent significant progress over the
                    situation of two to three years ago. However, West Berlin continues to rely
                    heavily on outside assistance to maintain itself. While the general improvement

                did not materialize in the form earlier feared. However, Berlin remains vulnerable
                to either sudden or gradual harassment of its lines of communication. There is some
                reason to believe that East Germany is being restrained from the steps it wishes to
                take by a Soviet desire to conciliate Western opinion and avoid incidents for which
                they would be blamed. Should the Soviets change this posture or decide that they can
                dissociate themselves from East German moves, it is probable that East Germany will
                use its powers over access to Berlin to seek to raise the level of its technical
                contacts with Federal Republic officials and thus obtain a measure of recognition by

                Western access to Berlin remains, in principle, as important as ever. Unless the

                its geographic and psychological disadvantages and must rely on outside assistance
                to maintain even its present level of activity. In order to attempt to continue the
                present rate of improvement, the Federal Republic will contribute to the city’s
                budget deficit, and private and public investment will receive assistance from
                counterpart of U.S. aid yet unspent or to accrue from principal and interest
                payments on old loans. Although the need for aid for strictly economic purposes is
                diminished there is a continuing need for visible and current demonstrations of
                continuing U.S. concern for the problems of the city and for the welfare of its
                people. Therefore modest amounts of new dollar funds will be required to underwrite
                selected projects with maximum impact to underline the continuing nature of U.S.

                which arose after the September 20, 1955 agreements between the USSR and East
                Germany, East Germany has not increased its interference with German transport and
                traffic to Berlin or Allied access to the city. Road tolls continued to be imposed
                by the East German regime, <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0466"/>but traffic of
                all types, including barge traffic, moved normally. On the other hand, during the
                past two weeks Allied military trains to and from Berlin have encountered
                administrative difficulties and delays occasioned by new Soviet procedures in
                checking the documents of travelers on the trains. However, no United States train
                has been prevented from completing its journey and in many cases there has been no
                interference with the regular train schedule. An Allied protest has been lodged with
                the Soviet military authorities against the interferences which have taken place. No
                clear pattern of Soviet intentions in this matter has as yet emerged.</item>

              nervousness over their own position East Germany. He surmised Soviet authorities in
              Germany had probably received orders in general terms from higher up to take special
              precautions for security of the area and that in course implementing these orders at
              working level new checking procedures of past several weeks for trains and convoys had
              resulted. He thought Soviets not prepared push matters to point of major incident. He
              also considered it possible Soviet interferences might have been designed initially to

            <p>623. From the Ambassador. Last night at British Ambassador’s farewell Berlin
              reception, Soviet Ambassador Pushkin concurred in my affirmation that British, French
              and American Ambassadors and the corresponding commanding generals had in 1953 and
              have now authority to determine who shall be carried on Western military trains.</p>
            <p>This concurrence proceeded from conversation I sought with Pushkin after hearing
              encouraging report from Hoyer Millar (Berlin’s following telegram).<note n="2"
                xml:id="d184fn2">This telegram reported that Hoyer Millar had raised with Pushkin
                the question of Soviet controls on Allied transportation to Berlin, mentioning in
                particular the threat made to confiscate passports. Pushkin had replied that the
                Soviets were merely trying to return to practices which had been in effect in
                1952–1953, and had no intention of interfering with Allied access. (<hi
                  rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 762.0221/1–1257)</note> Pushkin told me that existence
              of a train problem <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0468"/>caused by press penchant
              for sensationalism and asserted that violations train understandings by Western side
              had induced Soviets merely to correct laxity of recent years and to re-approach,
              although not reach, 1953 status. I replied that I remembered 1953, that train
              situation was then satisfactory and that if same situation were to prevail now, I
              should be content. It was at this point I emphasized Western Ambassadors and generals
              right to determine who shall be carried on military trains, an assertion in which
              Pushkin acquiesced.</p>
            <p>Tenor Pushkin’s remarks certainly indicates that civilian Soviet authorities do not
              wish challenge essential train rights at this time. Pushkin also revealed definite
              sensitivity to crisis publicity re Berlin, perhaps as prejudicial to Soviet soft
              tactics in Berlin, which I have reason to believe are still in effect. As Pushkin just
              returned from Moscow, his attitude probably reflects latest line.</p>
            <p>Concluding conversation concerning our respective tenures in Germany brought forth
              incidental information Pushkin anticipates transfer within the year.</p>

              <item>As general rule we believe that taking of measures vis-à-vis Soviets which could
                have effect of partial self-imposed blockade should be reserved for cases of
                significant interference by Soviets with Berlin access including, of course, any
                line of conduct their part which subjected Allied travel or shipment of supplies to
                such serious inconvenience that it would be tantamount to significant interference

              <item>In determining whether a particular Soviet measure constitutes significant
                interference with Berlin access, believe we should keep in mind possible Soviet
                motives in imposing measures in question. While motives for recent Soviet course of
                action not yet clear there seem at least these main possibilities: (a) Soviets may
                merely wish make their presence felt by ordering general tightening-up of security
                precautions in East Zone, with resulting unevenness in implementation these orders
                at lower levels; (b) Soviets may wish establish position they have right to
                determine who can travel or what we can take into Berlin; (c) more particularly,
                Soviets may be carefully laying basis for making case at future date that Berlin
                travel by non-military personnel except perhaps those attached to Berlin Commandant
                is not covered by Four-Power Agreements and must therefore be regulated and
                controlled by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Furthermore believe we must continually bear in mind certain basic aspects our
                own position, viz. (a) we must maintain principle that Ambassadors and Commanding
                Generals have right make final determination what individuals are authorized travel
                to and from Berlin, and what supplies are required, in connection with our
                occupation responsibilities there; (b) we have legal basis for maintaining that any
                restrictions imposed by Soviets on Berlin access which go beyond those existing on
                March 1, 1948 are violation of Four-Power Agreements; and (c) it is of great
                importance maintain to maximum possible extent tripartite solidarity and uniformity
                of practice in field of Berlin access. Further factor is that particular Soviet
                action and problem of counteraction if any to be taken by us should be viewed within
                context of general status over-all East-West relations existing at the time rather
                than on basis purely local considerations.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>In determining extent to which we wish make issue of any Soviet demand or line
                of action in given case, particularly where partial self-blockade would be involved,
                we think we should be prepared apply test also whether under all the circumstances
                Soviet position is on its face sufficiently unwarranted or unreasonable to ensure us
                full support Western public opinion, especially in US and <pb n="442"
                  xml:id="pg_442" facs="0470"/>in Germany, should serious consequences ensue from
                our refusal to go along with Soviet action. Type of case which would in our view
                meet this test would include Soviet insistence on boarding military train or
                attempting to remove passenger from train, or demand to inspect interiors of closed
                vehicles in military convoy or to line up train passenger inside train for
                inspection of documentation through train windows. On other hand we do not feel
                Soviet demand to see identification cards US enlisted personnel riding in military
                convoys meets requirements above test. This particularly true in view precedent we
                ourselves have already established in case recent US convoys and insistence British
                practice in past of showing identity cards upon request.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Above not intended of course to preclude reacting promptly by protest or query
                to Soviet departures from established practice which although not of character
                individually to interfere with our right of access might cumulatively result in
                significant erosion of our position.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>Additional problem to be decided in each case where Soviets create difficulty re
                Berlin access is extent to which publicity should be given to matter. We recognize
                publicity can be of considerable value, if used wisely and selectively, as effective
                instrument for inducing Soviet retreat in particular instances. This especially true
                if it appears clearly that Soviets have been responsible for difficulty in question
                and that it cannot reasonably be attributed to some act or delinquency on our part.
                On other hand would be inadvisable to create crisis atmosphere in weak or wrong kind
                of case. Must always be remembered that developments which emphasize to public mind
                vulnerability of access to Berlin can adversely affect morale of city and, by
                discouraging customers in outside world from placing orders in Berlin, undermine our
                fundamental objective of maintaining and further developing Berlin’s economic
                well-being. Moreover, current resumption cold war atmosphere makes threat of
                publicity less effective than at time Soviets sensitive to anything inconsistent
                with “peaceful co-existence.”</item>

                sent Bonn 623)<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4"><ref target="#d184"><hi rend="italic"

                1952) status as basis for Ambassador sending communication to Pushkin. This could
                welcome Pushkin’s statement that no intention to restrict in any way right of Allies
                to run military trains or interfere with Allied communications with Berlin; note
                that Pushkin reference to 1953 date not clear to us inasmuch as legally significant
                date is March 1, 1948, date used in 1949 agreement ending Berlin blockade (has
                Embassy or <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> any explanation Pushkin’s <pb
                  n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0471"/>use of 1953 date?); point out that in view of
                his statement, however, practices of that time as well as March 1, 1948 have been
                examined; bring to his attention that showing of identity cards of enlisted
                personnel of military convoys, of passports for travelers on military trains, etc,
                had not been practiced at either time; and conclude that in view of this he would
                modify present Soviet divergences former practices accordingly. Such a communication
                if sent would presumably best avoid detailed legal discussion but would make clear
                for the record and for whatever effect it might have on Soviets our annoyance with
                arbitrary and meaningless harassments of recent months. Pushkin reaction to this
                letter might have some bearing on our view re measures to be taken in future. On
                other hand if letter sent to Pushkin he would inevitably feel under pressure to
                justify past interferences and to document his reference to “ten choice cases of
                abuse” with resultant hardening of Soviet position. Question whether this desirable
                at present time when volume of Soviet harassments has declined. However above points
                might be made orally to Pushkin by Ambassador should occasion for presenting them

            <p>In the course of briefing the Council on the contents of these three policies, Mr.
                <persName>Cutler</persName> pointed out that a problem of interpretation of
              paragraph 10 of the policy on Berlin (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1) had
              arisen in the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, and that it would be desirable for
              the Council to clarify <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0472"/>the interpretation of
              this paragraph. The matter concerned the effect of an East German attack on Berlin.
              Paragraph 10 spoke only of a Soviet attack on Berlin, and the paragraph indicated that
              if the USSR should attack Berlin the United States would have to act on the assumption
              that general war was imminent. Nothing specific was said as to whether the
              implications in paragraph 10 were also intended to apply to an East German attack on
              Berlin. Mr. <persName>Cutler</persName> pointed out that at least one member of the
              Planning Board had expressed the view that an East German attack on Berlin might not
              automatically necessitate assuming the imminence of general war, as was stated in
              paragraph 10 with regard to a Soviet attack. Mr. <persName>Cutler</persName> then
              requested Assistant Secretaty of State <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> to
              comment on this problem. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> had taken
              Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ place when he left the
              meeting to keep his appointment with King Saud.)</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> stated that unhappily he had had no
              opportunity to talk with the Secretary of State about this problem and to ascertain
              his views about the implications of an East German attack on Berlin. However, he could
              say that lesser officials in the Department of State do not in general feel that it
              would be wise for the United States generally to equate a Soviet and an East German
              attack on Berlin, although this view did not deny that the United States might decide
              to equate these attacks.</p>
            <p>After Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had
              commented on the problem, the President stated that to him the matter seemed to come
              down to this: If the East Germans attacks with armed forces the armed forces of the
              United States anywhere in the world, the result would be war. However, if the East
              Germans attacked our forces the issue was not so clear. There certainly would be no
              automatic declaration of war, and we should be obliged to go to the Congress.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said that this was the State
              Department’s interpretation of thed problem, and Mr. <persName>Cutler</persName> said
              that he was satisfied that the problem of interpreting paragraph 10 had been cleared
              up and that our policy toward Berlin did not equate a Soviet and a satellite attack on
              Berlin.</p>

              <item><p>The Soviet motives and objectives in imposing the present Berlin difficulties
                  are not known to this headquarters. However, the Soviet pattern must be based on
                  one of the two following premises and, in either of these cases, a compromise of
                  the original allied position will be detrimental to our interest:</p>
                <p>(A) The intention of eventually increasing their restrictive measures to the
                  point at which they become unbearable and a blockade will result, or (B) on an
                  opportunistic exploitation of any Allied weakness shown in resisting the
                  restrictions.</p></item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>While it is agreed that partial self-imposed blockade should not be instigated
                except for significant causes, and that it should be based on circumstances which
                will generate a sympathetic Western press reaction, it is believed that acquiescence
                in a series of Soviet imposed restrictions which mav each in itself be a border-line
                case under these conditions will ultimately render the cumulative effect of
                restricting free access to Berlin. Past experience indicates the Soviets will push
                at all points, accepting their gains where lightly opposed, but withdrawing in the
                case of determined opposition.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>In view of the above, the following principles are believed to be paramount in
                the case at hand: (A) It is solely a United States right to determine who shall
                travel between West Berlin and the United States Military Command and diplomatic
                agencies in the Federal Republic of Germany. (B) The 1945 and 1949 agreements are
                best interpreted by usage since their adoption. This usage does not confirm Soviet
                restrictions recently imposed. (C) To maintain a right, it must be exercised to
                remain in effect.</item>
              <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0474"/>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Soviet imposed restrictions since 1 November 1956 which were considered
                objectionable consist of: (A) Soviet inspection of identity cards or passports of
                passengers on United States Berlin passenger trains. (B) Soviet seizure of Russian
                translations of travel orders on any of the passengers they consider objectionable.
                (C) Soviet insistence that a “Certificate of Status” stamp entry be in the passports
                of personnel traveling on United States orders by either train or autobahn to and
                from Berlin. (D) Soviet failure to clear a United States military convoy unless
                Soviet inspection of truck interiors was permitted. This Soviet position was
                withdrawn after the fact the convoy had been turned back was publicized. (E) Soviet
                refusal to clear United States military vehicle convoys without inspections of
                identity cards of enlisted personnel. (F) Soviet failure to clear a special command
                diesel train for 3 February unless the terminology of the letter conveying the
                request was to read “request permission.” (G) Soviet imposition of a thirty-minute
                stop in the Allied passenger train schedules at Marienborn in place of the former
                five-minute scheduled stop. (H) Soviet confiscation of temporary <gloss
                  target="#t_AGO1">AGO</gloss> card of United States train passenger. (I) Soviet
                failure to clear Embassy employees for autobahn travel to Berlin because of lack of
                “Certificate of Status” stamp and military orders. Soviets later withdrew from this
                position. (J) Failure to intercede in the case of detention and fining of two United
                States soldiers by the East German Volkspolizei for allegedly speeding on the
                Berlin–Helmstedt Autobahn.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>In addition to the above, the following unacceptable Soviet statements or
                threats have been made: A. Soviet officers would occasionally enter Allied passenger
                trains at Marienborn to check travelers against nominal rolls. B. Non-entitled
                persons are being carried on Allied passenger trains. C. Interpretation of the 10
                September 1945 Four-Power agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">For text of this
                  agreement, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1970,</hi> pp.
                  42–44.</note> and Zorin–Bolz letters of 20 September 1955<note n="4"
                  xml:id="d187fn4">See <ref target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> to give the
                Soviets the unilateral right to introduce such control measures as they see fit over
                train and autobahn travel. D. Objectionable Allied train passengers passports will
                be subject to confiscation. E. Right of control over the traffic between Federal
                Republic of Germany and West Berlin of military personnel and freight of the
                garrisons of the United States, England and France quartered in West Berlin is
                exclusively within the competence of Soviet military authorities. F. Wording in
                letters requesting travel of special command diesel trains must be changed to
                include phrase “permission for passage.”</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>The actions and threats described above are considered as cumulatively
                threatening free Allied access to Berlin. It is, therefore, <pb n="447"
                  xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>considered that both a straightening of the record
                and a course of positive action which accepts the possibility of partial self
                imposed Berlin blockade must be undertaken if threat and further Soviet restrictions
                are not to be accepted.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>It is, therefore, proposed that: A. The American Ambassador for Germany during
                his farewell call on Mr. <persName>Pushkin</persName> set the record straight on the
                above emphasizing that the appropriate United States authorities will determine who
                shall travel through our rightful corridors to Berlin; that no agreement exists
                which properly permits the Soviet authorities to supervise or control this traffic;
                that a Russian translated travel order issued by appropriate United States
                diplomatic or military authority is sufficient documentation for this travel. In the
                future this translation is the only individual documentation which will be shown for
                passengers traveling on United States trains. In the case of military convoys the
                Russian translations will indicate all officers by name and will specify only the
                number of enlisted personnel traveling in the convoy. The existing procedures will
                continue to be followed for several days to permit the Soviets only sufficient time
                to disseminate appropriate instructions to their subordinate authorities. B. A
                tripartite agreement to return to the Allied positions prior to the onset of the
                Soviet restrictions last November be reached if possible. C. In event a tripartite
                agreement to the above cannot be obtained, a coordinated United States unilateral
                action to accomplish our objectives be undertaken.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>It is again pointed out that should the proposal in “C” above be adopted, much
                less risk would be involved in testing Soviet firmness and intention by initially
                trying to break their insistence on inspection of identity cards of enlisted
                personnel traveling in military convoys. If a favorable solution can be reached on
                this matter, it should be a short step from there to a favorable resolution of the
                train problem; on the other hand, should failure result at this step, the loss would
                be small since the convoys have little purpose except to determine freedom of access
                to the autobahn and the entire matter could be re-evaluated prior to
                continuing.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>I, therefore, recommend execution of the plan proposed in <gloss target="#t_SX1"

              <item>I had also given some consideration to desirability of sending communication to
                Pushkin on access matters and especially in regard to recent incident involving two
                Embassy staff members who were at first turned back from Autobahn on basis that
                their travel orders, issued by Embassy, were not valid. Have been inclined, however,
                to keep written communications at a minimum out of concern as <gloss
                  target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> has suggested, that Soviets might thereby be
                stimulated to confirm in writing a firm clarification of their present position from
                which it might be the more difficult to withdraw. If by any chance this is a
                temporary phase of tightened security precautions which has been caused by events in
                satellites and which may eventually pass, feel it wiser in most cases to deal orally
                with Soviet authorities and try to avoid pressing them into taking rigid positions.
                I had therefore decided to take advantage of farewell calls in Berlin Feb 14 to see
                Pushkin and bring up again recent access difficulties. In addition to points made in
                paragraph eight of Deptel, will also endeavor to remove any doubt from Pushkin’s
                mind about my status as successor to Military Governor and High Commissioner in
                Germany and my consequent authority to issue travel orders to Berlin. This approach

              <item><p>While we have been willing to try to work out some acceptable form of
                  passport stamp indicating traveler is entitled to entry into and exit from Berlin,
                  have always had reservations as to how far this would really meet our problem.
                  Basis of Soviet position appears to be, as nearly as we can understand
                  inconsistent Soviet statements this subject, that only members of forces have
                  right of access and consequently that only military authorities have right to
                  issue orders. Forces stamp is only superficial evidence of status Soviets are
                  looking for, and I doubt that we would solve this basic problem for long, if at
                  all, by providing Embassy personnel with stamps similar in appearance <pb n="449"
                    xml:id="pg_449" facs="0477"/>and wording to forces stamp. Nevertheless, I am
                  willing to try again to reach tripartite agreement on passport stamp but would
                  suggest that this be delayed until after forthcoming discussion with Pushkin to
                  see if any further clarification is made at that time.</p>
                <p>In this connection and regarding Berlin’s suggestion that British and French
                  documentation may be more efficacious in averting difficulties, should be pointed
                  out that British have imposed a kind of self-blockade since beginning of access
                  difficulties and are not permitting any personnel who do not possess forces stamp
                  to travel to Berlin either by military train or Autobahn (ourtel 2521)<note n="4"
                    xml:id="d188fn4">Telegram 2521 from Bonn reported that the three Western Allies
                    had met on January 31 to work out the form for a stamp on travel orders issued

                  traveling. Believe it is this fact, in case of British at least, which has
                  minimized difficulties for them rather than difference in
                documentation.</p></item>

              <item>I have something of same misgivings about utility of amending Embassy’s travel
                orders, since no change in formulation really affects basic principle of
                Ambassador’s right to determine who may travel to and from Berlin. Fundamental point
                made by Soviets in recent refusal to acknowledge validity of Embassy’s travel orders
                on Autobahn was that they were not issued by military authorities, and I suspect
                their later reference to signing official as “tourist” agent was merely diversionary
                device. There certainly appears no objection, however, to changing formula of
                signature on travel orders and we intend to modify it along lines of Berlin’s
                suggestion. For time being, remain opposed to use of formula linking traveler to
                Berlin occupation, but this question can be reviewed again in light of discussion
                with Pushkin.</item>

              <item>Department’s attention is drawn to fact that three Embassies here have divergent
                policies at present for dealing with any attempt by Soviet authorities to confiscate
                passports from passengers on military trains. Continue believe we should turn back
                trains in such instance and, although believe possibility of confiscation is remote,
                consider it desirable to have uniform tripartite instruction on access procedures.

            <p>915. From Trimble.</p>

              <label>1.</label>
              <item>My call on Pushkin this morning at Soviet Embassy in East Berlin took place in
                reasonably friendly atmosphere.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Following Pushkin’s
                  failure to meet Conant, the Embassy in Bonn tried to arrange a meeting between
                  Trimble and Pushkin. On March 12, Trimble reported that the meeting had been set
                  for March 14 and that the British and French had concurred in his approach. (<hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 762.0221/3–1257)</note> Although definitely not a
                jovial type, he appeared relaxed and well-briefed on general line to follow.
                However, he was weak in certain details and on occasion resorted to vague and even
                contradictory language.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>After initial exchange of pleasantries, I opened discussion by welcoming
                Pushkin’s affirmation of January 11 to Conant that the Ambassador and our military
                commanders have arthority to determine who shall be documented with travel
                  orders.<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3">See <ref target="#d184">Document
                  184</ref>.</note> I recalled Conant’s letter to Pushkin of May 5, 1955<note n="4"
                  xml:id="d189fn4">A copy of this letter was transmitted in telegram 3441 from Bonn,
                  May 7. (Department of State, Central Files, 121.62A/5–755)</note> stating that
                when designated as Ambassador former had been entrusted by the President with
                authority exercised in capacity of High Commissioner as successor to Military
                Governor. There could therefore be no doubt of American Ambassador’s right to
                determine whom he shall document for travel either by military train or Autobahn. I
                noted that, despite assurances given by Pushkin, there have recently been Soviet
                efforts to interfere with right of access of personnel with travel orders issued by
                Ambassador or military commanders. Since there accordingly appeared to have been
                some misunderstanding, I would be grateful if Pushkin could see to it that
                instructions were issued to avert such interference in the future.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>I continued that, in conversation with Conant, Pushkin had referred to
                procedures of 1952-53 stating Soviets were merely reverting to practices of that
                period. We had made study and could not find any evidence that during 1952-53 any
                other practices were in effect than those being observed prior to Soviet changes of
                last November. Legally significant date is actually March 1, 1948, date cited in
                1949 agreements. Conceivably possible source of misunderstanding was old form of
                Embassy travel orders. This form was now changed and samples of new form had been
                supplied to Soviet Deputy Commandant in Berlin. I concluded opening remarks be
                giving Pushkin <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"/>sample of new form and
                expressing hope this would end questioning of travel orders issued under authority
                of Ambassador.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>In response Pushkin stated that he recalled letter received in May 1955 from
                Ambassador Conant after abolition of High Commission. He had not intention of
                questioning duties and functions of American Ambassador in Bonn. As far as he was
                concerned, he (Pushkin) had no responsibility for travel of persons to and from West
                Berlin. WHen Soviet High Commission was abolished all such matters were referred to
                military authorities. This procedure was agreed upon in Bolz–Zorin exchange of
                letters. If his memory was correct, he continued, he had written Ambassador Conant
                regarding this change of functions.<note n="5" xml:id="d189fn5">Pushkin informed
                  Conant on September 24, 1955, that the Soviet High Commission for Germany had been
                  abolished. (Telegram 250 from Berlin, September 24, 1955; <hi rend="italic"
                    >ibid.,</hi> 762.0221/9–2455)</note></item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Although strictly speaking, therefore, Berlin travel questions were within
                competence of Soviet military authorities, he was prepared to discuss subject and
                would inform Soviet military authorities regarding our conversation. Position of
                Soviets was that agreements should be respected and they expected friends from other
                countries to abide by same principle. If one did not violate agreements all would go
                well. Question was not by whom travel orders were issued, since right of Ambassador
                to issue orders not questioned, but to whom they were issued. In accordance with
                Soviet-American agreements, he continued, not every American national has right to
                travel to West Berlin. Only persons who belong to American administration in Germany
                had such right. This was quite clear and Soviet military authorities would cause no
                difficulty if principle were observed.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item><p>Regarding his conversation with Ambassador Conant on control of American
                  trains, Pushkin claimed that reference to 1952 date was based on misunderstanding.
                  He had merely explained to Dr. <persName>Conant</persName> and British Ambassador
                  Hoyer Millar that new circumstances had arisen since then in connection with
                  trains (presumably alleged Allied violations which had come to attention of
                  Soviets). Ambassadors Conant and Hoyer Millar had seemed to think that the Soviets
                  were instituting a new procedure. Actually they were merely carrying out Four
                  Power agreements which gave to Soviets right to control travel to and from Berlin.
                  Within framework of this right to control, they could give up all controls if they
                  wished or strengthen tnem if necessary. Under all circumstances, assurance of
                  normal movement of trains remained. Pushkin emphasized that, as he had told
                  Conant, there was a form of control prior to 1952 carried out by Soviet military
                  authorities. They had entered trains and checked passenger and freight documents.
                  In 1952—though he was not certain of timing—</p>
                <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0480"/>
                <p>Soviets had reduced their controls to a minimum, not as a result of negotiations
                  with US but by unilateral action. He was not sure now what basis of this decision
                  was; perhaps it was confidence that Americans were fulfilling their obligations
                  conscientiously under agreements. He had been informed by Soviet military
                  authorities that these obligations had been and were being violated by movement of
                  improper persons on trains. This involved violation both of agreements with
                  Soviets and also of Soviet agreement with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                  which could not be disregarded. Actually controls which military had reestablished
                  were not so severe as those prior 1952. Although controls had aroused protest on
                  part of Americans, there was really no basis for such objections. This was
                  essentially what he had told Ambassador Conant and Hoyer Millar. Soviet
                  authorities had no intention of violating any agreement. Soviet military
                  authorities had explained situation to him in this way and he had no reason for
                  doubting them.</p></item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>In response I stated that I had come to Pushkin on the assumption that, as in
                the analogous case of our Ambassador in Bonn, he represented the highest Soviet
                authority in Soviet Zone. Pushkin interjected this was not quite the case; the
                Soviet system was somewhat different. Moreover, I continued, as he knew, we do not
                recognize the German authorities in the Soviet Zone (his only reaction to this was a
                wry expression). US also repects agreements; I could not accept his contention that
                we violated them. However, Ambasadors and military commanders have right to
                determine to whom travel orders are to be issued. We recognize Soviet Government can
                control train traffic in Soviet Zone but this does not include determination of who
                should receive travel orders. I welcomed Pushkin’s statement that there was no
                desire on part of Soviet authorities to interfere with normal movement of
                trains.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>I denied that physical checking of passengers was ever carried out in past by
                Soviet officials; at most, train commanders gave train manifests to Soviet officer.
                Pushkin interjected that “that” is what he meant by control (presumably he was
                referring to presentation manifest). He then corrected himself by adding that it was
                difficult for him to state precisely what form “other controls” and assumed in past
                but they had been carried out. I commented that we had checked the records and could
                find no evidence of this.</item>
              <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0481"/>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>Moreover, I added, we could not agree that there had been violations on our part
                in view of the undoubted authority of the military commanders and the Ambassador to
                determine who should receive travel orders. I would hope that in raising subject
                with appropriate military authorities Pushkin would do all he could to avoid future
                interferences of kind we have suffered in last few months.</item>
              <label>10.</label>
              <item>Pushkin then conceded that we were quite correct in claiming that American
                authorities have right to determine who gets travel orders but with one
                qualification. Only those persons who belong to “American administration in Germany”
                were entitled to them. This was consistent with agreements, and was purpose of
                entire train, Autobahn and plane connection of Berlin to Western Germany provided at
                end of war.</item>
              <label>11.</label>
              <item>To this I responded that right of Ambassador and military commanders to document
                travelers included right to document anyone they considered necessary and important
                for our occupation of Berlin. Pushkin replied that this concept did not correspond
                to agreements or their “spirit.” I stated that was our interpretation of them, and
                that, as he knew, our right to be in Berlin derived from conquest. He did not
                challenge latter remark and merely repeated that we should interpret agreements in
                accordance with their spirit. He recommended their study and said this would
                convince us. I said we had studied them and had come to the conclusions already
                stated. After some 40 minutes, I broke off discussion at this point by welcoming
                chance to make call and exchange views and by expressing hope he would give
                attention to our views and thus avert future difficulties.</item>
              <label>12.</label>
              <item>In our opinion most significant features of foregiong discussion were: (a)
                Pushkin’s statement, repeated on several occasions, that Soviets considered
                legitimate travelers to Berlin to be those connected with American administration in
                Germany. At no point did he take extreme position, which we had thought he might,
                that only those associated with Berlin garrison fell within theis category, (b) He
                made no attempt to challenge right of the Ambassador or military commanders to issue
                travel orders, (c) He made no reference to any specific conpilation of alleged
                abuses in use of military trains and Autobahn, perhaps because this would have been
                inconsistent with his denial of direct competence to deal with subject of Berlin
                travel, (d) He affirmed that Soviets have no intention of interfering with movement
                of military trains.</item>

              <item>Hillenbrand, who accompanied me, shares my impression, as does Gufler, that
                Soviets do not wish to precipitate crisis at this time over Berlin access. They seem
                convinced they have a point but are apparently not sure how hard and how far they
                wish to press it. We believe that discussion with Pushkin has served useful purpose
                and <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0482"/>laid groundwork for possible later
                airing of subject by Ambassador Bruce in light of factual situation at that
                  time.<note n="6" xml:id="d189fn6">On March 25, Gufler reported that the French had
                  had a similar conversation with Kotsiuba concerning French travelers to Berlin.
                  The meeting was friendly, and, after reviewing several cases of Soviet denials,
                  the French had proceeded along lines similar to those of Trimble. Kotsiuba’s
                  replies were similar to Pushkin’s, but the French had the definite feeling that
                  the Soviets were rethinking their position perhaps as a result of the
                  Trimble–Pushkin meeting. (Telegram 940 from Berlin, March 25; <hi rend="italic"

              <item>Berlin is legally an area under quadripartite military occupation by U.S.,
                British, French and USSR troops. The U.S. maintains a broad range of
                responsibilities for the city, including the maintenance of West Berlin’s status as
                a part of the “free world” and the security of the West Berlin populace and the
                allied garrisons and dependents therein.</item>

                  Berlin as long as their responsibilities require it. They, therefore, reaffirm
                  that they will treat any attack against Berlin from any quarter as an attack upon
                  their forces and themselves”. (Annex to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

              <item>Berlin remains as it has been since 1945 a critical area where the U.S. and
                Soviets are in direct contact and in which a determined maintenance of U.S. power
                and prestige is necessary. Although Berlin’s position makes it vulnerable to
                Communist pressures both direct and subtle, it also provides the Western world with
                opportunities, non-existent elsewhere in the Soviet bloc, to maintain direct
                contacts with the captive population of a satellite state and to bolster popular
                resistance to Communist measures. The dual position of Berlin has been illustrated
                during recent months by the fact that Soviet–<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                harassment of Allied travel through the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to and
                from Berlin has taken place concurrently with our continued full and effective
                exploitation of the Western position in the city.</item>

              <item>U.S. policy toward Berlin is inextricably related to policy toward the Federal
                Republic and toward East Germany. There is no ultimate solution to the complex
                problems posed by Berlin’s geographic position and special status other than
                reunification of Germany in freedom, with Berlin restored to its historic role of
                capital. Consequently, U.S. programs for Berlin must serve both the interim
                objective of maintaining the security and welfare of the City so long as Germany
                remains divided and the ultimate objective of achieving German reunification. The
                condition and morale of Berliners in the Western Sectors and the accessibility of
                the City, and all that it can offer, to refugees and visitors from East Germany have
                a direct bearing on progress toward achievement of these aims.</item>

              <item>After usual amenities, during which Kotsiuba indicated he had returned from

                “confusion, misunderstanding, and difficulties” regarding Allied travel to Berlin
                had arisen as result of faulty procedure for documenting travelers. Kotsiuba
                complained travel orders are issued by number of different US headquarters (he cited
                seven), that contents of orders differ, that not all travel orders are complete
                (some, he said, are not “properly stamped”), that orders are signed by many
                different persons, that orders do not contain necessary data to establish that
                traveler is authorized to proceed to Berlin, and that orders have been issued to
                “tourist”, including businessmen <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0496"/>and
                persons having no official business in Berlin. Recent change in Embassy travel order

              <item>Kotsiuba then defined types of persons who, in Soviet view, were authorized to

                  <item>Staff of US Commandant in Berlin,</item>
                  <label>b.</label>

              <label>6.</label>
              <item>These persons, said Kotsiuba, should produce at Soviet checkpoints in addition
                to travel orders as described above, some form of documentation establishing
                traveler is employed by US Commandant, is member of Berlin garrison, or is member of
                family of one of these two. Documentation, said Kotsiuba, could take form of (1)
                special passport stamp “such as British use” (he may have been referring to status
                of forces certificate stamp in passports) or “special certificate”.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>With respect to travelers from West Germany to Berlin, Kotsiuba stated only
                persons who came to Berlin on duty are legitimate travelers. These, he said, should
                carry, in addition to travel orders, documentation establishing they are coming to
                Berlin on permanent change of station or temporary duty.</item>
              <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0497"/>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>Above procedures, said Kotsiuba, would apply to both Autobahn and train, and, if
                they were followed, no trouble should result.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>After Kotsiuba finished describing Soviet requirements mentioned above, I
                reminded him that I represented only US and asked whether he planned to speak to
                British and French. He did not seem to have anticipated this question, but replied
                he would have similar meeting with French and British political advisers as soon as
                possible.</item>
              <label>10.</label>
              <item>Referring to conversations of Ambassador Conant and Chargé Trimble with Soviet
                Ambassador Pushkin and our own earlier conversation, I reminded Kotsiuba that US had
                already made its position clear; that there had been no difficulties prior to
                November 1956, when Soviets introduced new procedures; and that Ambassador and
                military commanders have right to determine who should be documented to travel to
                Berlin. I informed Kotsiuba I would, however, bring his comments to attention of my
                British and French colleagues and of the Embassy. While making it clear I could give
                no commitments regarding any of his suggestions, I pointed out it would in any case
                be technically impossible to take decision on these matters by May 1.</item>
              <label>11.</label>
              <item>Although Kotsiuba had just returned from Moscow, I am not certain whether he
                spoke with full authority or whether he was primarily repeating line concocted
                locally by his staff. Certain arguments and turns of phrase seemed reminiscent of
                those previously heard from Kotsiuba or his assistant Shilob. It seems likely,
                however, that Soviets have decided time has come to make effort to end present
                situation of mutual protest on trains of presence certain passengers and occasional
                refusal of clearance on Autobahn to certain travelers followed by Allied protest.
                While in some respects their present proposals mark retreat from previous position,
                they presumably fall considerably short of what we could accept and represent
                attempt to eliminate large miscellaneous category of travelers to Berlin
                particularly alleged tourists and other persons with no obvious official reasons for
                travel to Berlin. We have impression that Soviets feel that they are under pressure
                from <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials and wish to throw them some
                concessions in way of control over certain travelers to Berlin previously processed
                by Soviet control officers.</item>
              <label>12.</label>
              <item>At meeting later today of political advisers, British and French were informed
                of foregoing. They indicated that they had within last hour received call from
                Soviets requesting meeting with Kotsiuba on Monday.</item>

                <label>1.</label>
                <item>Kotsiuba’s manner was pleasant and conciliatory, and he put on good initial
                  act to show Soviets motivated mainly by desire to eliminate needless
                  misunderstandings at checkpoints and confusions about Allied documentation
                  procedures. However, content of his statement was dogmatically phrased, and there
                  was always undercurrent of implication that “misunderstandings” could be
                  eliminated only on terms he was proposing. As he proceeded with his long opening
                  statement it seemed to become clearer that these were scarcely proposals intended

                    and military commanders who would determine who would be documented for travel

                <item>What Soviets appear to be attempting is to achieve their current objectives
                  regarding Allied travel to Berlin by obtaining acceptance of documentation
                  procedures which in effect embody those objectives. While that objective seems
                  considerably mitigated in some respects from extreme statement of Soviet position
                  last November and has taken account of protests by Allies (for example in
                  broadening categories of “permissible” travelers and accepting issuance of travel
                  orders by Ambassador), they appear to go far beyond what we are prepared to accept
                  in way of narrowing down issuance of travel orders. Primary target of Soviets
                  appears to be large miscellaneous category of travelers whom they label as
                  “tourists” and “businessmen”. They seem to have in mind largely travelers
                  originating in <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0499"/>West and proceeding to
                  Berlin, since practically all persons stationed in Berlin now given travel orders
                  would seem to fall within “permissible” categories.</item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>Although Soviet motive for individual rather than collective approach to three
                  political advisers might be hope of bringing Allied unity, seems more probable
                  they requested meeting with US first because they may feel, from such statistical
                  analysis as they may have made, that movement of leave travelers to Berlin is
                  primarily an American interest. Moreover, diversity of authorities issuing travel
                  orders is limited to United States.</item>
                <label>4.</label>
                <item>Only reason which occurs to us for Soviet demand that new travel orders
                  contain German as well as Russian translation is that this connected with some
                  gesture towards <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, perhaps desire to be able to
                  show that Soviets are narrowly interpreting categories of travelers they will
                  continue to process apart from <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> controls at
                  check points.</item>
                <label>5.</label>
                <item>If in rather unlikely event it should develop that Soviets really wish to
                  negotiate rather than dictate terms under which to end present unsatisfactory
                  situation at border check points, essential issue posed is whether (a) some
                  accommodations in form can be envisaged (e.g., restriction of travel order issuing
                  authorities) without concession of any essential principle to enable Allies to
                  make counterproposals or (b) Soviet statement must be rejected in total as
                  intolerable effort, by proposing basic changes in documentation procedures, to
                  achieve objectives they have failed to obtain by less clear-cut actions in past

              by Kotsiuba démarche.</p>
            <p>While a few of Kotsiuba’s demands could probably be met (e.g., greater uniformity of
              travel orders), question arises whether Three Powers would wish comply with even these
              demands under pressure of what is tantamount to Soviet ultimatum, at least as regards
              effective <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>date. More difficult problem is
              extent, if any, to which we would be prepared to meet other demands, such as those
              concerning only two signatories each for agencies issuing travel orders, “nature of
              duties” of traveller, purpose of travel, etc., some of which obviously infringe basic
              position that it is right of three Ambassadors and military commanders, and not of
              Soviets, to determine who shall be authorized for travel to Berlin. We would
              presumably be prepared, in order to keep military trains running and Autobahn open for
              travel, to continue some limitations on categories of personnel authorized to travel;
              but presumably we would not be prepared to let Soviets know we were imposing such
              limitations nor to agree to all their demands regarding documentation and data to be
              contained therein.</p>
            <p>Given ultimatum date of May 1, early action by Three Powers obviously necessary. On
              assumption Kotsiuba makes démarche to British and French similar to that made to
              Hillenbrand, several possibilities occur to us: <list>
                <label>1.</label>
                <item>Three political advisers Berlin might inform Kotsiuba in writing that position
                  of Three Powers already made clear, i.e., that Ambassadors and military commanders
                  have right to determine who shall be authorized for travel to Berlin; that this
                  procedure worked satisfactorily until Soviets instituted new procedures last
                  November; and that we cannot accept Soviet attempts to impose restrictions on our
                  right of access to Berlin which was established by Quadripartite Agreement and
                  reaffirmed by New York and Paris Agreements 1949.</item>
                <label>2.</label>
                <item>Similar communication might be sent instead from three Ambassadors to Pushkin
                  with reference, in British and US letters, to Hoyer Millar’s and Trimble’s talks
                  with Pushkin in January and March, respectively.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">See

                    >189</ref>.</note></item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>Either of above communications might include additional statement to effect
                  that we would be willing to study possibility of clarifying and making more
                  uniform our travel orders and other travel documentation, but that for obvious
                  technical reasons this cannot be done by May 1 and would, in fact, require at
                  least several months.</item>
                <label>4.</label>
                <item>Three political advisers Berlin might see Kotsiuba together this week and
                  communicate orally substance of 1 through 3 above.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>Alternative 4 has perhaps several advantages in that it seems preferable at this
              stage to keep discussion on oral basis and not evoke written statement of Soviet
              demands; also because further talk with Kotsiuba might afford (a) indication whether,
              as suggested paragraph 5 Berlin’s 908, there any flexibility in Soviet position and
              (b) some clarification of their motive in specifying May 1 as cut-off date.</p>
            <p>Regarding this date and Kotsiuba’s “proposal” that German as well as Russian
              translations of travel orders be presented, we agree <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
                facs="0501"/>suggestion contained paragraph 4 Berlin’s 908, but also believe there
              good possibility that Soviets intend in near future to turn over control of
              checkpoints on Autobahn and rail routes to East Germans, and that revised procedures
              they demanding by May 1 is preparatory to such move.</p>
            <p>We hope discuss situation with British and French here tomorrow if they have by then
              reports of their Berlin representatives’ talks with Kotsiuba.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d193fn4">On April 23, Gufler reported that Kotsiuba had repeated almost
                verbatim the statement he had made to Hillenbrand on April 20. The three Western
                political advisers then agreed on the following three recommendations in formulating
                the Allied position: 1) an entirely negative reply should be avoided if possible; 2)
                it would be undesirable to become involved in a discussion of the categories of
                travelers; and 3) perhaps a new tripartite stamp could be used as an Allied
                counterproposal to test whether the Soviets were interested in a reasonable
                settlement or wanted complete acceptance of their demands. (Telegram 1028 from

              <item>The position of the Soviets with reference to access to Berlin, if correctly

              <item>While some of Kotsiuba’s points are merely refinements of restrictions which we
                have had to bear since November 1956 the underlying <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474"
                  facs="0502"/>concept appears to be that the Soviet military will permit only those
                whom they consider to be pure members of the occupation of West Berlin to travel
                under Soviet supervision and documentation. This would mean that members of forces
                and their dependents stationed in Berlin, and those officials (military for sure and
                diplomatic perhaps) who actually have bona fide business connected with the
                occupation will be passed by the Soviet military. All others will travel, or not
                travel, as determined by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. By inference today
                and actuality tomorrow, the Soviets will determine appropriateness of any official

            <p>I called today on Soviet Ambassador Pushkin.</p>
            <p>After somewhat lengthy preliminary exchange of courteous conversation and
              ingurgitation of Armenian brandy I said I felt I would have to talk frankly about
              difficulties caused by Soviet personnel at checkpoint Helmstedt regarding travel
              orders to Berlin, citing particularly the case of Mr. and Mrs. <persName>Robert
                Evans</persName>, who have been held <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0504"/>up for
              several days. I requested my interpreter to read in Russian following prepared
              statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“I represent the U.S. Government here not only as Ambassador, but with the
                  authority and responsibility in Berlin of the High Commissioner as successor to
                  the US Military Governor in Germany.</p>
                <p>“There can be no doubt of my right to determine whom I shall document for travel
                  either by military train or Autobahn. The present situation is most
                  unsatisfactory.</p>
                <p>“As far as I am concerned you are the highest Soviet authority in these affairs.
                  I am calling this to your attention in the expectation and hope that you will
                  issue appropriate orders to bring to an end these unnecessary, vexatious and
                  irritating petty incidents.</p>
                <p>“At a time when your government pronounces itself in favor of relaxing
                  international tensions some of its representatives seem to be engaging in tactics
                  calculated for the annoyance and delay of legitimate travel.”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>Pushkin replied along following lines:</p>
            <p>His position in this matter was different from mine as in addition to his duties as
              Chief of Embassy his concern was with all-German problems only. Soviet Government had
              delegated matters of checkpoints and travel to its military authorities in Germany. He
              was, however, familiar with question, had been in close contact with Soviet military
              authorities during recent developments and wished to assure me that Soviet military
              authorities did not wish to provoke incidents or cause difficulties. Reason for their
              action was lack of proper order and agreed procedure in such matters and their recent
              proposals were aimed at establishing this needed order. If only three sources issue
              travel orders for American personnel in Germany, namely the U.S. Commander in Berlin,
              the U.S. Commander in Chief in Germany, and the U.S. Ambassador in Bonn, and if it is
              agreed only certain designated persons are allowed to sign these travel orders, and an
              agreed stamp is used, that would serve to eliminate possible incidents rather than to
              cause them.</p>
            <p>I commented that powers of the U.S. Ambassador, in his position as successor to the
              military government and to the High Commissioner, were according to his statement
              different from those of the Soviet Ambassador. I could not concern myself with
              internal Soviet procedure and had no intention whatever of discussing such problems
              with Soviet Commandant. Mr. <persName>Pushkin</persName> replied he did not think it
              was as complicated as that, adding that after all he belonged to the same government
              as his military authorities and therefore could very well act as an intermediary. He
              quoted the categories of American nationals who, in his opinion, could be issued
              orders for travel to Berlin, naming occupation personnel in Berlin and persons sent to
              Berlin on official duty travel, such as personnel of the Embassy in Bonn, U.S.
              military personnel in West Germany and others <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0505"
              />who are sent to Berlin on official business as the only acceptable categories. He
              stated emphatically that no existing agreements provided for leave travel to Berlin
              and that when such travel occurs it should be processed through entirely different
              channels. He stated in his opinion it was improper for U.S. Embassy to delegate its
              travel issuing authority to an American tourist office. At this point Mr.
                <persName>Gufler</persName> said it might be a difficulty of translation, since the
              Soviets chose to translate “travel and transportation office” as tourist office.</p>
            <p>I cited the case of Mr. <persName>Evans</persName> as an example of a person
              belonging to one of the categories mentioned by Mr. <persName>Pushkin</persName>. I
              stated that if I issued travel orders the Soviet personnel at the checkpoint had no
              business stopping the holder and that this endless quibbling seemed to me ridiculous.
              Also I termed the time limit for the introduction of new travel orders set by Col.
              Kotsiuba as entirely unworkable. Mr. <persName>Pushkin</persName> stated that his
              understanding was that the time limit was merely a proposal of Col. Kotsiuba’s and was
              not in the nature of an ultimatum.</p>
            <p>In conclusion I added that I was not prepared to enter into a debate on details but
              wished him to understand exactly how we felt on the principles involved.</p>
            <p>Pushkin was unfailingly polite throughout interview.</p>
            <p>An hour after my return to office following message received by telephone from
              Colonel Kotsiuba for Hillenbrand: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“Instructions have been issued to allow the married couple Evans to pass.</p>
                <p>“I am calling your attention again to the causes which lead to the
                  above-mentioned incident, the repetition of which may lead to similar
                  difficulties.”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>I am instructing Evans to proceed by car tonight or tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Pushkin paying return call on me tomorrow morning at 1100.<note n="4"

                <item><p>(a) They should present Kotsiuba with rough copies of travel orders and
                    stamps, and of new passport stamps.</p>

                    of date of introduction.</p>
                  <p>(c) If he says he will give Soviet comments later, he should be told that the

                    necessary, he should be told that it is for the issuing agencies to decide to
                    whom travel orders should be issued, and that new documentation clearly shows
                    that travelers have authority of these issuing agencies.</p>
                  <p>(d) If Kotsiuba insists that documentation must have Soviet approval before
                    being introduced, political advisers should state that they can only report his
                    attitude to their governments, since it is in direct contravention of basic
                    right, repeatedly reaffirmed by himself as well as by Pushkin, of Ambassadors
                    and military commanders to determine authorization for travel to

                <item>Without giving Kotsiuba samples of the new documentation, political advisers
                  should inform him that: <list>
                    <label>(a)</label>
                    <item>They agree it would be useful to revise travel order forms and stamps

                      there may be some difficulty because Army, Navy and Air Force Commands are
                      separate. (Comment: If it is possible to resolve this difficulty prior to

                      of Berlin’, thus fulfilling Kotsiuba’s request regarding ‘purpose of travel’

                  introduction of new passport stamp should obviate difficulties experienced at
                  Soviet checkpoints by travelers authorized by Ambassadors. Reaction to any
                  comments by Kotsiuba should be as in I and II above.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Object of course I is to avoid risk that new
              documentation would be rejected by Soviets on grounds that they had not cleared it,
              while at same time avoiding giving impression that we are seeking Soviet approval. It
              would also avoid labor and expense of actually producing new documentation which
              Soviets might reject when it was put into use. Objection to course I is that it would
              take at least several weeks to work out new travel order forms to show Kotsiuba, and
              might, however much we argue to contrary, be interpreted as submitting new
              documentation for Soviet approval.</p>
            <p>Object of course II is to attempt to clarify points of principle before undertaking
              work of producing new documentation which Soviets might reject when it is introduced.
              It also has advantage that it could be carried out at once. Risks are that it might
              make Soviets harden their attitude and would not necessarily prevent them from
              refusing to accept documentation eventually produced on grounds that they had not
              given their prior approval.</p>
            <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0508"/>
            <p>Course III has advantage that it could be carried out without delay as form of new
              passport stamp has already been tripartitely agreed. Object would be to overcome
              present difficulties whereby travelers are rejected by Soviets because they have no
              status stamp and allow US to continue using old travel order forms until satisfactory
              new ones have been worked out. (This argument may not apply on US side as Soviets have
              raised objections to their current form as issued by the Embassy.) Disadvantage of
              course III is that it is two-stage operation and, if Soviets make difficulties over
              clearing passport stamp, we would then have additional difficulties in second stage in
              clearing both passport stamps and new travel order forms.”</p>
            <p>Of courses suggested therein, British Embassy prefers I but would apparently also
              settle for II. We have some preference for II but believe I also acceptable. French
              presently inclined favor III although British, who suggested it, do not like it nor do
              we because in view our own difficulties not only over lack of passport stamp but also
              over our current travel order forms, we do not believe it would solve our present
              problems even on temporary basis.</p>
            <p>Would appreciate comments soonest.<note n="6" xml:id="d196fn6">0n May 9, Gufler
                cabled his general agreement with the proposals advanced in this telegram, but
                stressed that the Soviets were unlikely to wait indefinitely for a Western response.
                He advised that if tripartite agreement could not be reached on course I, then
                consideration might be given to combining courses II and III to the extent of giving
                Kotsiuba a sample of the new passport stamp. (Telegram 1085 from Berlin; <hi

              whatever the outcome, on maintaining the principles underlying our right of access to
              Berlin or whether in last analysis, if Soviets continue to press their current
              demands, we would be prepared to yield to them in order to keep open limited access to
              Berlin.</p>
            <p>Soviet position as expounded by Kotsiuba and Pushkin seems clear. Although they
              recognize right of Ambassadors, military commanders and Commandants to authorize
              travel to Berlin, they have stated that only certain categories of persons should be
              authorized and that, of these, some should be authorized for duty travel only.
              Kotsiuba has furthermore demanded that new documentation be introduced specifying,
              inter alia, traveler’s status and purpose of his travel. Pushkin, in less precise
              terms, indicated same requirements. This, plus fact that Kotsiuba’s original démarche
              to three political advisers<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">See <ref target="#d191"
                  >Document 191</ref>.</note> was made on heels his return from Moscow, strengthens
              our belief that his demands were based on specific instructions from Moscow.
              Instructions were perhaps motivated by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> insistence
              that Bolz–Zorin letters of September 1955<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4">See <ref
                  target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> finally be implemented rather than by
              Soviet desire to create difficulties over Berlin access as such.</p>
            <p>Whatever the motivation, first question is what if any flexibility is there apt to be
              in Soviet position, i.e., is there possibility they may be satisfied with
              documentation we are now prepared to provide? In our view, chances are at best slight
              that they will be, but answer should emerge more clearly from political advisers’ next
              round with Kotsiuba. If he rejects documentation as inadequate or indicates he must
              study it before approving it, next move could be stiff letters from three Ambassadors
              to Pushkin, followed if necessary by tripartite démarche at Moscow.</p>
            <p>Before taking matter to Moscow, however, and perhaps even before approaching Pushkin,
              it would seem advisable to determine ourselves and then to seek tripartite agreement
              on how far we are <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0510"/>prepared to go in
              maintaining our basic position. British, for example, have indicated that in end they
              would impose severe limitations on their travel to Berlin if it was necessary in order
              to keep travel open for personnel stationed in Berlin. Thus they seem not too strongly
              opposed to including in travel orders statement regarding traveler’s occupation and
              purpose of travel, and giving German as well as Russian translation of orders. French
              tend to stronger position, perhaps because in any case they have only minimum of
              travellers, with little or no leave travel involved.</p>
            <p>Our situation is somewhat more difficult in view of amount of US travel, particularly
              by military train. It is our understanding that trains carry about four thousand
              passengers a month, with weekend travel sometimes as high as four hundred per night.
              While we have no breakdown of this, it seems probable that large proportion is leave
              travel, with at least some of it undertaken not by regular military or civilian
              personnel but by members of “voluntary agencies” such as Brethren Service Committee,
              American Friends of Russian Freedom, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">FOSTER</persName>
              Parents’ Plan for War Children, etc., who are still entitled to use military trains.
              Obviously a good deal of this travel could be eliminated including, if necessary,
              leave travel for personnel not stationed in Berlin, but this is question for
              determination by Washington in light various factors involved.</p>
            <p>Question remains, however, of position to be taken vis-à-vis Soviets. It seems to us
              there two broad alternatives: (1) to maintain, by démarche at Moscow, if necessary,
              that it is we and not Soviets who have right to determine authorization for travel to
              Berlin, including purpose for which travel authorized, and that we are not prepared to
              go further in question of new documentation than uniform travel order forms, passport
              stamps, etc., which should be adequate assurance that we are appropriately supervising
              travel (this would not prelude our eliminating some of present travel, as suggested in
              foregoing paragraph, but we would not inform Soviets we were so doing nor would we
              agree to include “purpose of travel” in travel orders); or (2) to try at Kotsiuba
              level to win out on basis principles set forth in (1) but be prepared, if Soviets
              remain adamant, to yield to their documentation requirements.</p>
            <p>Alternative (1), if démarche at Moscow were unavailing, could lead to open showdown
              with trains being turned back and attendant publicity. In this event, it seems
              probable we would have full support of public opinion since issue would not merely be
              one of type of documentation and legitimacy of leave travel, but more basic one of
              whether it is Soviets or Three Powers who determine latter’s rights. It is also not
              impossible that if strong tripartite position were maintained up to Moscow level, if
              necessary, Soviets would yield <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0511"/>sufficiently
              in their demands to enable us to arrive at some tolerable modus vivendi.</p>
            <p>Alternative (2) would involve inevitable loss of prestige but loss might be somewhat
              less if we had not taken issue to Moscow. Possible danger inherent this alternative is
              that Soviets would be encouraged by our yielding on these demands to make new ones in
              near future.</p>
            <p>As stated earlier in this message, we believe it important determine this basic
              question on our own side and, if possible, tripartitely before proceeding beyond
              contemplated next step with Kotsiuba. Would therefore appreciate views soonest so that
              we may discuss with British and French.</p>

                <item>We agree with Embassy re disadvantages course III and would favor eliminating
                  it from consideration.</item>
                <label>2.</label>
                <item>Only substantial difference between courses I and II appears that in former we
                  would present to Kotsiuba at time initial approach “rough” copies of tripartitely
                  agreed travel orders and new passport stamps whereas in latter we would merely
                  describe these orally in general terms. Possible disadvantage latter course is
                  likelihood that Kotsiuba, in absence any specific document on which he could
                  focus, would be unwilling take any position which would be meaningful and that he
                  would merely state he could not comment until he had seen actual documents. This
                  would leave us just where we were before approach made. Furthermore, while we
                  agree we should avoid any indication we are submitting documents for Soviet
                  approval <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0512"/>rather than purely for
                  information, it is at least conceivable, bearing in mind difficulties Soviets have
                  had in past with certain aspects our Russian translations of travel orders, that
                  Kotsiuba might make some suggestions of technical character re form or wording of
                  documents not affecting substantive issues involved which could actually be
                  helpful.</item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>Department therefore sees some advantage course I, which could be combined
                  with certain specific aspects enumerated under course II such as II–a, II–b
                  (depending on resolution British problem) and II–d.</item>
                <label>4.</label>
                <item>Believe approach to Kotsiuba on above basis should be made soon as possible.
                  Hope it will not take “at least several weeks” to work out in rough form new
                  travel orders to show Kotsiuba, despite problems involved in tripartite
                  coordination Bonn and Berlin as well as with military headquarters.</item>

              <item>Today’s lengthy session of political advisers with Kotsiuba produced few
                surprises and confirmed our previous impression that primary objective of Soviets is
                to eliminate leave travel by Allied personnel stationed in Western Germany and
                documented with <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> orders for travel to
                Berlin. Atmosphere of meeting was amiable, but there was clear underlying
                appreciation that, despite superficial appearance of meeting of minds on many
                points, essential issue remained unsolved.</item>

              <item>As chairman political advisers for June, French political adviser Bressier made

                Kotsiuba were for his information and not clearance. After receiving samples,
                Kotsiuba, who throughout was his usual rambling, seldom crystal clear self, replied
                that he was pleased to note that Western powers had understood that essential
                objective was to achieve certain uniformities in documentation, lack of which has
                caused various difficulties since last November. He indicated that, in principle, he
                agreed with proposals made by Allies, to extent that they seemed to him to derive
                from proposals which he had previously made. Only problems which remained concerned
                certain details.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>After rather cursory examination, Kotsiuba stated that form of travel order
                presented to him seemed adequate to enable satisfactory checking at control points.
                However, he believed that orders should likewise contain German translation for
                reasons which he said he had explained during previous meeting with political
                advisers (actually he had given no reasons).<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">For a

                    191</ref>.</note> He then expatiated that certain Allied travelers had tendency
                to leave main Berlin–Helmstedt Autobahn inadvertently, and that these persons
                inevitably ended up by coming into custody of East German police, who, in order to
                enable them to recover their bearings and to find way out of <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                  >GDR</gloss>, would require German version of travel orders in order to establish
                their identity as legitimate Allied official travelers. He cited in this connection
                recent case of American non-com who started off on Autobahn for Helmstedt <pb
                  n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0515"/>but ended up at Hof checkpoint en route to
                Munich. While he was eventually cleared by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                officials, Kotsiuba pointed out, such clearance could have been more expeditious if
                they could have immediately established from his travel orders that he was American
                non-com officer rather than having to enlist services of interpreter to translate
                orders into German. Kotsiuba gave no other reason for requiring German version of
                travel orders, but stressed that all he was interested in was welfare of Allied
                travelers who might thus stray from regular route. Therefore, he requested that
                Allies study question further to determine whether they could not also provide
                German translation of travel orders along with three languages already provided on
                sample forms presented to him.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba next asked what purposes of having all three issuing authorities on
                same travel order form was. When Bressier explained that intention was to cross out
                inappropriate authorities, leaving designation of issuing authority whose signature
                and seal actually appeared on travel order in question, Kotsiuba said that, while he
                could not object in principle to form as it was, he thought it would be desirable if
                separate form could be used for each issuing authority. Otherwise danger would arise
                that wrong authority would be crossed out or it would be forgotten to cross out any
                of issuing authorities; this could only lead to misunderstandings and
                confusion.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>It was pointed out to Kotsiuba that it would be simpler to print one form rather
                than three kinds of forms for each of three Allies, but that his comments would be
                reported as made.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>In response to query by Kotsiuba as to whether intention of Allies was to have
                no more than two persons sign on behalf of Commandant, Ambassador or Commander in
                Chief, he was told that his understanding was correct.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>At this point Kotsiuba went off on long digression re Allied personnel stationed
                in Berlin. He requested that, in addition to sample copies of travel orders which
                had been given to him, he also be supplied with samples or photostatic reproductions
                of military identification cards used by military personnel and of passport stamps
                used by civilians or members of families of military attached to Berlin military
                government. Kotsiuba also indicated he would like not only sample of Commandant’s
                stamp but also some indication of page in passports on which it would normally be
                placed. He then said wished to make personal suggestion which, he recognized, might
                be administratively expensive and not feasible, but which he wished to make anyway.
                If Allies could put in Russian language stamp on separate sheet of paper to be
                attached to back page of passport containing number of ID document, full name of
                individual traveler, and statement whether such traveler was member of military
                garrison, of civilian employee of military government or member of family or <pb
                  n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0516"/>servants thereof, this would greatly expedite
                processing at checkpoint by Soviet control officers. However, he did not insist upon
                this, but merely offered it as suggestion to expedite clearance procedures.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba then went on to say that, as far as travelers documented by Ambassadors
                or Commanders in Chief in Western Germany were concerned, travel orders could be
                issued only to persons traveling to Berlin on official duty or coming to Berlin to
                be stationed here. Therefore, their temporary duty orders should be attached
                directly to travel orders. Glancing at sample of Embassy stamp, he said that he
                thought such stamp would satisfy this requirement. However, he added, he could not
                at all agree with absence of Russian translation of stamp which would lead to great
                difficulties, and he would therefore have strongly to request that Russian
                translation of this stamp likewise be provided. Without break, he then went on to
                summarize his understanding of procedures which would come into effect on new
                documentation. This would involve first inspection of travel orders by Soviet
                control officer at checkpoint. This officer would then look at number of ID document
                indicated on travel order. He would then check this with ID card or passport of
                traveler to establish if name and number corresponded. If these documents were in
                order, Soviet control officer would then turn to third document which would be
                stamped to indicate whether traveler was moving on basis of duty orders or on
                transfer.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>When it appeared that Kotsiuba thought that stamp, sample of which presented to
                him, was intended to be put on separate sheet of paper, it was made clear to him
                that intention was that this stamp would be placed in passport itself. Kotsiuba then
                said this would not be convenient for travelers since, if such stamp was to be
                placed in their passport every time they made trip to Berlin, passports would
                rapidly be exhausted. He was told that purpose of having expiry date was to enable
                issuance of stamp for a specific period of time to cover any number of trips to
                Berlin by traveler which might be required during period of time in question.</item>
              <label>10.</label>
              <item>After receiving translation into Russian of stamp, Kotsiuba reversed himself and
                stated that it now appeared to him that stamp was not very well worded at all and he
                was therefore forced to propose that format be changed to permit stamp to show
                whether traveler was proceeding to Berlin on official business or on appointment to
                Berlin. Political advisers pointed out that, apart from his remarks on wording of
                stamp which they were not prepared to discuss but could only report to their
                principals, they wished to call his attention to fact that stamp in question was
                intended only to cover travelers documented by Ambassador and not those documented
                by Commanders in Chief in Western Germany. It was stressed that, apart from
                Commandants’ stamp in passports of persons stationed in <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489"
                  facs="0517"/>Berlin, Allied passports might also contain stamp showing that
                traveler was member of Allied forces stationed in Western Germany entitled to travel
                to Berlin, as well as stamp, sample of which had just been given to him.</item>
              <label>12 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</label>
              <item>On this point Kotsiuba commented that, as far as travelers originating in Berlin
                were concerned, position was quite clear. However, Commander in Chief in Western
                Germany could only issue orders to army personnel if they were coming to Berlin
                either on temporary duty or on permanent change of station, and such personnel would
                also have to have a similar separate piece of paper or stamp showing that this was
                the case. Finally, he stated that he hoped that before any new documentation was
                introduced, final versions of the forms would be sent to him so [garble—that he?]
                could study them, and if acceptable in principle, appropriately instruct checkpoint
                control officers.</item>
              <label>13.</label>
              <item>At this point, prior to breaking off discussion, we stated we wished to bring to
                his attention threats made by Soviet control officers to our train commanders on
                last two nights re absence of Soviet translation of <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1"
                  >USAREUR</gloss> seal on travel orders. We said we thought it highly
                inappropriate, while general discussion of changes in documentation was proceeding,
                for Soviets to make new and unreasonable demands re travelers on military train, and
                we requested that Kotsiuba take measures to have control officers instructed to
                cease making such demands. He stated that he was not familiar with cases in
                question, but he was sure that they had involved misunderstanding and he would make
                appropriate inquiries.</item>
            </list>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> While political advisers adhered closely to limits
              set by instructions received, they were obviously unable to restrain Kotsiuba from
              commenting freely on various aspects of problem. No commitments were made and he is
              fully aware that, at most, political advisers will report his views to their
              principals. While he did not object to new travel order forms as such, it is quite
              possible that, upon further and more close scrutiny, he may also find them
              objectionable in that they do not contribute to that control over certain categories
              of Allied travelers at which Soviets are obviously aiming. Kotsiuba indicated his
              understanding that there would be no immediate changes in present documenting
              procedures and did not in any way give impression that during interim period these
              would be questioned. However, it seems clear we are far from having found any basis
              for modus vivendi and that today’s conversation merely marked another round in series
              of difficulties which began last November. However, for what it is worth, it may be
              noted that Russian manner in general was conciliatory and any implied threats were
              always delicately veiled.</p>

              <item>Political Advisers’ June 1 meeting with Kotsiuba has made clearer than ever a)
                that current Soviet objective is to deny use of Autobahn and military trains for

                and b) that solution of various problems relating to form of orders, stamps, etc.

              <item>In reaching decision whether we should continue to insist on maintaining type of
                travel in question we feel following considerations should be taken into account: <list>
                  <label>a)</label>
                  <item>Distinction exists between our basic interests in Allied access to Berlin
                    and those marginal interests which are without significant effect on our basic
                    position. Fundamental function of Berlin access is to enable Western Allies to
                    discharge their responsibilities in connection with occupation of Berlin. This
                    includes supply of Allied personnel stationed in Berlin, leave travel to West
                    for such personnel, and travel to Berlin of Allied officials to perform duties
                    in connection with administration and occupation of Berlin and maintenance of
                    City’s welfare.</item>
                  <label>b)</label>
                  <item>We must continue insist that Ambassadors and Commanders alone have right to
                    decide whose travel to Berlin is necessary. However we would not be on
                    particularly firm ground in insisting that travel to Berlin of large number of
                    leave personnel from West is based on determination by Ambassadors or Commanders
                    that such travel is essential to carry on Allied occupation functions in
                    Berlin.</item>
                  <label>c)</label>
                  <item>General references in original four-power agreements on Berlin access to
                    “free access by air, road and rail from Frankfort and Bremen for US forces” do
                    not in context (previous clause refers to “garrison of Berlin”) provide
                    unassailable legal basis for travel to Berlin for purposes personal pleasure.
                    Value of 1949 New York agreement in providing for restoration situation existing
                    prior March 1, 1948 considered limited in view our understanding that in period
                    1945–1948 leave travel to Berlin as such was discouraged (because of limited
                    facilities in Berlin) and that published military regulations, probably
                    available to Soviets, forbade such travel except in special circumstances.
                    Presumably therefore prior to March 1, 1948 there was little or no Allied leave
                    travel from West to Berlin authorized as such (request Embassy verify this
                    point). In any controversy we would of course seek to make effective use of the

                    authorities) requiring them to pass leave personnel on same basis as duty
                    personnel is not clear.</item>

                  <item>Current difficulties with Soviets have now been going on for over 7 months
                    during which Soviet attack has increasingly centered on documentation failing to
                    establish travel to Berlin is for official purpose. While we probably could live
                    with present situation more or less indefinitely, despite annoyance and
                    inconvenience caused in individual cases, Soviets are likely try to bring matter
                    to a head in not distant future. While difficult to foresee exact means they
                    might use to do so, one possible line would be for Soviets to notify us that
                    unless by certain specified date Allied documentation is changed to meet Soviet
                    requirements Allied travelers will not be permitted to proceed past Soviet
                    checkpoints. Upon arrival specified date, assuming no action has been taken by
                    us to meet Soviet demand, Soviet course might be to challenge arbitrarily one or
                    more travelers on military train as traveling for unacceptable purpose. They
                    would then confront us with alternative of either removing such personnel from
                    train or returning to point of origin. While on first such occasion, and
                    possibly a few times thereafter, we would probably choose latter alternative, we
                    could not long continue this course of action of imposing rail blockade on
                    ourselves solely on behalf of interests of leave personnel.</item>
                  <label>e)</label>
                  <item>There appears no likelihood that our protests at local level against Soviet
                    action, which would presumably be based on express instruction from Moscow,
                    would be any more effective than in recent instance of protest against Soviet
                    action in checking individual identification US military convoy personnel. Any
                    tripartite demarche in Moscow, which would be difficult to make without becoming
                    publicly known, would engage Soviet prestige in manner unlikely produce
                    favorable result unless Three Powers were in position exert effective political
                    or psychological pressure or take further measures in case of rebuff. Previous
                    examinations of feasibility exerting pressure by retaliatory measures have led
                    to conclusion that under existing circumstances results unlikely be productive.
                    Moreover Soviets are aware that public opinion in US and other Western
                    countries, including Federal Republic, unlikely to support strong measures
                    involving risk of serious crisis in situation where Soviets were not interfering
                    with movement of personnel to and from Berlin on legitimate occupation business
                    and where Soviets would be in position to present issue as involving nothing
                    more than inexpensive leave and recreational travel.</item>

                  <item>Certain disadvantages would of course be involved in eliminating or
                    drastically restricting leave travel to Berlin by Autobahn or military train.
                    Since only alternative means of travel would be by more expensive commercial air
                    (travel via other land routes involving acceptance <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                      >GDR</gloss> visas is of course out of question for official personnel) there
                    would be many fewer leave travelers to Berlin. Cheap leave travel to Berlin has
                    contributed to morale of forces, and expenditures <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492"
                      facs="0520"/>of leave personnel in Berlin have helped Berlin economy. These
                    factors are however subsidiary to importance maintaining fundamental aspects our

                prepared “for present” to hold out against Soviet position that personnel stationed
                outside Berlin be authorized for duty travel only. We believe we should follow same
                course. In light considerations advanced above however, question arises whether we
                should not be prepared, if at some future point in negotiations with Soviets such
                action appears necessary, to take steps (but without indicating to Kotsiuba we are
                doing so) to protect our basic interest in Berlin access by internal measures to
                restrict Berlin leave travel via Autobahn or military train by those persons not
                stationed there. Should we do so we would avoid involving our prestige on issue
                where strong public support would probably be lacking and on which it highly
                doubtful we would win out in any event. In addition we could thus prevent issue from
                developing in manner which might compromise vis-à-vis Soviets their recognition, at
                least thus far, of right of Ambassadors and Commanders to determine what travel
                necessary in connection with occupation of Berlin. Such decision would not prevent
                limited issuance temporary duty orders (without per diem) to leave personnel in
                cases issuing authorities believed important. It would on other hand require barring
                advertising by American Express of package tours to Berlin from West for military
                personnel using military trains. It would be preferable, if such decision were made,
                to implement it, so far as possible, gradually and without dramatic impact.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>If this decision were made, we would then be in position if necessary to develop
                some phrase for travel orders under heading “purpose of trip” such as “official
                government business”. Obviously no specific designation of duties or occupation of
                traveler should be given since detail under this heading would open door to
                challenge by Soviets in individual cases and arguments over definition and
                interpretation which could jeopardize position of each person traveling to and from
                Berlin.</item>

              <item>Re mechanical problems of form and language of travel orders, stamps, etc.
                raised by Kotsiuba, we believe these can best be worked out by various interested
                headquarters in Germany. On language point, however, we would see no real objection
                in principle to having both travel orders and stamps prepared in all four
                languages—English, French, Russian and German—if this considered practicable and
                proves necessary. As concerns use of German for travel orders, however, it might be
                preferable have this set out as <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0521"/>fourth
                language on uniform version travel order for use by nationals all three Western
                Powers (allowing for necessary variations from uniformity for different flags each
                national element, designation of issuing authority, signatures, etc.) rather than
                preparing separate complete document in German.</item>

            <p>At American Commandant’s July 4 reception, Kotsiuba went out of his way to reiterate
              point to American political adviser that he would be leaving for Moscow middle of
              month for period of six to eight weeks and that he hoped meeting could be arranged
              before his departure to “settle” travel problems he had been discussing with Allied
              political advisers. He said that there were, after all, only a few minor points to be
              resolved, and gave definite impression that he wanted to have something in his pocket
              on this subject when he arrived in Moscow. Although Kotsiuba has been overflowing with
                <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0522"/>conviviality on recent social occasions in
              West Berlin, it is, of course, impossible to say whether this, plus his statements
              belittling points at issue, means he will actually be more conciliatory in effort to
              reach modus vivendi on Berlin access. Our general impression is that strength of his
              position in Soviet hierarchy Berlin area is partly based upon ability to maintain
              picture of himself as Soviet official who is able to deal with Allies, and it is not
              inconceivable that having “settlement” of current travel problems when he goes to
              Moscow at this period of change in leadership may assume some importance for him
              personally.</p>
            <p>American Director Spandau reports that Kotsiuba went through essentially same act on
              Saturday during lunch at prison. This morning American political adviser received
              telephone message from Kotsiuba requesting that latter be informed when and where
              meeting could be arranged to “complete discussion of travel procedure at checkpoints
              Nowawes and Marienborn.”</p>

              <item>Allied political advisers met with Kotsiuba this afternoon. Despite apparent
                anxiety of Kotsiuba to resolve issues prior to his departure for Moscow (which has
                been postponed until end of next week), basic problem of leave travel remained
                unsolved during lengthy and repetitious discussion. This is preliminary report which
                will be supplemented by fuller tripartitely-agreed account after further discussion
                with British and French tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">Transmitted in

              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Apart from reiterating much of what he said during June 1 meeting, Kotsiuba made
                following new points: (a) Soviets consider travel order as merely document
                establishing right of person to be processed by Soviet control officers at
                checkpoints and not as adequate authority in itself to validate right of individuals
                to travel to Berlin. Soviets apparently are thinking in terms of their own practice
                which involves separate documentation for mode of travel and right <pb n="495"
                  xml:id="pg_495" facs="0523"/>to travel. (b) Except for persons connected with
                occupation of Berlin, Soviets would be willing to have Kommandirovka appear on
                reverse side of travel order if this would simplify procedure from Allied point of
                view.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>After detailed presentation by British chairman political adviser Ledwidge along
                lines of revised tripartite paper in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 08 to
                  <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">See <ref
                    target="#d202fn2">footnote 2, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>
                Kotsiuba noted that not all questions raised by Soviets during June 1 meeting had
                been answered. He then launched into explanation which, for first time, clearly made
                point in para 2(a) above. Travel order merely answered question regarding kind of
                transportation being used and, in case of car, proved that bearer was owner thereof.
                Therefore he could not agree that travel order should be labeled Kommandirovka and
                requested that heading remain as in sample documents given to him during June 1
                meeting.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>As far as personnel stationed in Berlin were concerned he could understand how
                Commandants’ stamp (preferably translated into Russian) would apply to civilian
                personnel. But he queried how Soviets could be expected to know that military
                personnel, bearing military ID documents, were actually members of Berlin garrison.
                This was why at June 1 meeting he had laid emphasis on having separate piece of
                paper identifying bearer as member of occupying forces in Berlin. In response to
                statement by British political adviser that travel orders signed by Commandant
                should be adequate proof that person is stationed in Berlin, Kotsiuba indicated this
                would not be satisfactory for military personnel. He added that small stamp on ID
                documents of military personnel would suffice indicating they were stationed with
                forces in Berlin.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Sample Ambassadors’ stamp which had been given him seemed generally satisfactory
                except that it should be issued only for specific trip and labeled
                Kommandirovka.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>After point had been made that Allies felt that stamp in passport was evidence
                of continuing right to come to Berlin issued under authority of Ambassador, which
                had been recognized by Pushkin, to send official personnel to Berlin as and when he
                wished, Kotsiuba said that such permanent stamp should be issued only to members of
                occupation in Berlin. Ambassador should authorize personnel only for single trip,
                even though period for such single trip not limited in duration.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>As to travel orders issued by Allied Commanders in Chief Western Germany, he
                stressed again that military personnel stationed in Western Germany would
                legitimately come to Berlin for only two purposes: (a) on transfer to Berlin as
                member of Berlin garrison, (b) <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0524"/>on duty
                travel to carry out specific assignments. No limits, however, would be set on
                numbers or ranks of personnel so assigned.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba then proposed that, in interests of simplification, he could agree that
                reverse side of travel orders contain Ambassadors’ stamp. He later said this would
                also apply to Kommandirovka to be issued by Commanders in Chief Western Germany.
                However, stamps issued by Commandants, since they were of permanent nature, should
                appear in passports.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>It was made clear to Kotsiuba that political advisers could only report his
                additional proposals to their superiors. In meantime they assumed no new procedures
                would be introduced, and that present forms would continue in use. Kotsiuba said
                that he hoped entire matter could be settled before end of next week when he left
                for Moscow. Political advisers said they would communicate with his office as soon
                as instructions received.</item>

                    limited progress has been made in the field of tripartite military planning
                    regarding action to be taken in the event of serious interference by the Soviets
                    with access to Berlin. During the period the three Allied Commanders-in-Chief in
                    Germany completed and submitted to the three Ambassadors a study regarding the
                    feasibility of using limited force in the event of such interference for the
                    purposes of (a) determining Soviet intentions and (b) attempting to reopen
                    access to Berlin. This study concluded in essence that the use of limited force
                    would be feasible for the purposes indicated above in the case of serious Soviet
                    interference with Allied access to Berlin by the road and air routes, but not in
                    the case of such interference with access by the rail or water routes. The State
                    and Defense Departments instructed our Embassy in Bonn to seek British and
                    French concurrence in a further request to the three military commanders to
                    initiate tripartite planning with regard to the specific military measures which
                    could be taken in those areas where the use of limited force had been determined
                    to be feasible.</item>

                November, 1956 the Soviets have been creating difficulties for Allied travel to
                Berlin by military train and Autobahn by their action in questioning the
                documentation carried by certain categories of Allied travelers. While these
                difficulties have resulted in no significant interference with Allied travel to
                Berlin, they continued throughout the period despite a number of Allied protests. On
                April 20 the Soviets presented, at the Berlin Commandant level, a list of specific
                requirements regarding the documentation to be carried by Allied travelers to
                  Berlin,<note n="7" xml:id="d204fn7">See <ref target="#d191">Document
                  191</ref>.</note> indicating that unless these requirements were met travelers
                without such documentation would not be permitted to pass Soviet checkpoints. The
                position taken by the Soviets raises the basic issue of whether they have the right
                under Four-Power Agreements to question the determination by the Western Powers as
                to what categories of Allied personnel are entitled to travel to Berlin by military
                train or Autobahn. In his first call on Mr. <persName>Pushkin</persName>, the Soviet

                both Allied and German traffic to Soviet and East German harassment. The threat of

                with occupation of Berlin” adds nothing essential to travel orders now in use, that
                all current travel to Berlin is authorized “in connection with occupation of
                Berlin”, and that documentation changes accepted cannot be taken as representing any

                    <p>In discussing Berlin travel questions with Colonel Kotsiuba, Political
                      Advisers have been concerned solely with question of revising documentation
                      procedures in order facilitate processing of Allied travelers at Soviet
                      checkpoints. Soviet suggestions have been received and studied and certain
                      counter-suggestions have been made, and it is believed that new procedures
                      under consideration will definitely assist in accomplishing that very
                      practical objective. Political Advisers wish emphasize, however, that any
                      suggestions regarding documentation procedure which they may have made or any
                      changes to which they may agree must not be construed as representing
                      departure from long-standing position with respect to right of access to
                      Berlin of which Allies have reminded Soviets on several occasions in past.
                      Should Soviets consider that travel instruction stamp on reverse of travel
                      orders certifying bearer has right to travel to Berlin in connection with
                      occupation of Berlin would contribute to easier and more rapid clearance of
                      Allied travelers, Allies are prepared follow such procedure. If proper Russian
                      translation for “instruction” or “ordre de route” in this sense is
                      “Komandirovka”, Allies have no objection use of that word. However Political
                      Advisers wish reiterate that in view their governments possession of a
                      properly completed travel order should be adequate without additional
                      documentation to establish both that bearer has right proceed to Berlin and
                      that specific voyage described is authorized. Allied Ambassadors,
                      Commanders-in-Chief, and Commandants in Berlin are not at this time
                      authorizing any travel to Berlin which they do not believe essential or
                      desirable in connection with occupation of Berlin, and they have no intention
                      of doing so in future. However they must insist that determination of what
                      travel is to take place in connection with occupation is right which is theirs
                      alone. Allied authorities will continue take full responsibility for all
                      persons traveling to Berlin on basis Allied travel documentation, and they
                      expect Soviet control officers to clear without question or delay any traveler
                      properly documented. Political Advisers would be pleased at any time discuss
                      with Colonel Kotsiuba any practical problems which may arise in connection
                      clearance Allied travelers. They feel discussions to date have been useful in
                      clarifying situation and trust Colonel Kotsiuba shares their view that, with
                      proper show of good will on either side, there should be no need for further
                      difficulties.</p>

                basic rights, in hope this will make possible solution problem palatable to Soviets
                and arrival at modus vivendi re system for processing military train and Autobahn
                travelers, and (b) necessity for making our basic position this problem sufficiently

                of bad faith or subterfuge our part.</item>

              <item>While earlier today Ambassador Bruce agreed that meeting with Kotsiuba might be
                cancelled, as recommended by <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>, he did not
                feel that we would refuse to participate if British or French showed strong desire
                to hold meeting. At discussion later this morning of political advisers, British and
                French both made it quite clear that they considered cancellation of meeting highly
                inadvisable, especially at last minute and urged strongly that it be held as
                scheduled. As a matter of fact, British had wished to use occasion specifically to
                raise question of freight cars with Kotsiuba. In light of instructions from
                Ambassador re necessity of British and French concurrence to cancellation of
                meeting, American political adviser agreed go ahead with meeting. Moreover,
                subsequent message was received from Kotsiuba himself stating that he would not
                reply to protest from Colonel Connor (see para 5 USBER tel 290 to Bonn rptd <gloss

                  Connor had protested the detachment of a mail car which was subsequently moved to

              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba was in extremely assured mood and gave impression of talking with
                complete confidence re his authority to discuss all aspects Berlin access problem.
                At beginning of meeting, he indicated that, after finishing with documentation
                question, he would like to discuss matter of freight cars privately with American
                political adviser. In response to this, he was told that since British and French
                also had interest in subject, and indeed since French had had refrigerator car
                removed from their train previous night, they likewise wished participate in
                discussion.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba began by saying he did not wish today to question right of Americans to
                attach freight cars to military passenger trains. He said that quadripartite
                agreements provided for definite number of military passenger trains and military
                freight trains. He noted that number of freight trains authorized was not being
                fully used by US, but that instead incorrect practice was being followed of
                attaching freight cars to military passenger trains. He reiterated he did not <pb
                  n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0533"/>wish to argue about this practice per se, but
                added that, if necessary, he would raise question at future meeting of political
                advisers. He then announced that trains would tonight be permitted to pass freely
                with freight cars attached, but he could not agree in future with system of
                documentation presently being used for such attached freight cars. He said that on
                regular military freight trains documents were provided stating that cargo carried
                was war material or material needed by army. However, as far as freight cars
                attached to military trains were concerned, documentation seemed to be German which
                had led <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss>s to believe that cargo was being carried
                in interests of certain German firms. He then stated he wished warn Allies that, if
                in future such attached freight cars did not have same documentation as cars on
                regular freight trains they would not be permitted to cross border. Present system,
                he added, would only remain in operation until 1500 hours Sept 21. Kotsiuba then for
                third time made point that for present he was not objecting in principle to idea of
                attaching freight cars to military trains but merely to inadequate
                documentation.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>While wishing to avoid any substantive discussion of question, American
                political adviser felt he could not leave matter simply hanging at this point. He
                stated position outlined <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 146 to Berlin,
                rptd <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> 937,<note n="5" xml:id="d206fn5">Telegram

                  Reichsbahn forbidding attachment of freight cars to passenger trains. (<hi

                  target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss>s seemed to be laboring under number of
                misconceptions. In any event, deadline set seemed completely unreasonable. To this
                Kotsiuba responded that, as generous gesture, he would fix deadline at 2400 hours
                Sept 21. After further protest on part Allied political advisers re unreasonableness
                of setting deadline, Kotsiuba set time limit of 2400 hours Sept 22, and then finally
                2400 hours Sept 23. It was pointed out to Kotsiuba that, as communicated to Shilov
                in his absence (see USBER tel 213 to Bonn),<note n="6" xml:id="d206fn6">Not printed.
                  (Ibid, 762.0221/8–2857)</note> present practices re freight cars had been in
                effect for more than ten years. This, it was stressed, gave Allies certain
                indubitable rights as to present usages.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>British political adviser asked question re baggage cars to which <gloss
                  target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> officers at Marienborn had objected although they
                were always attached British trains. Kotsiuba replied that <gloss target="#t_Sov1"
                  >Sov</gloss>s did not oppose attaching baggage cars to passenger trains, as this
                was normal procedure.</item>

            <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>
            <p>He then once again came back to point which he obviously considered significant that
              military freight trains could not carry goods for German firms. Here discussion of
              freight cars concluded.<note n="7" xml:id="d206fn7">On September 23, the Embassy in
                Bonn reported that it had sent a message to Kotsiuba noting that the documentation
                on the freight cars attached to passenger trains was the same as that for freight
                trains, and that it was made available to Soviet officials at checkpoints. The
                message concluded that Kotsiuba should issue appropriate instructions to allow
                trains to pass unheeded. (Telegram 974 from Bonn; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
                762.0221/9–2357) A followup report on September 24 noted that the British and French
                had sent similar messages and that the trains to and from Berlin that night had been
                routinely passed by Soviet officials. (Telegram 331; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>

              <item>First subject discussed during meeting late yesterday of political advisers with
                Kotsiuba was documentation of Allied travelers. French chairman political adviser
                began by reading agreed statement text of which contained <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                  >Embtel</gloss> to Berlin 96 rptd <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> 691,<note

                  762.0221/9–2157) This statement was virtually the same as that transmitted in
                  telegram 182, <ref target="#d205">Document 205</ref>.</note> after which sample
                forms and stamps handed Kotsiuba. Latter expressed his thanks for statement but said
                he could not agree with everything in it. If he had understood intent of statement,
                however, question under discussion with him for a number of months now seemed ripe
                for settlement. As he had stated before, his aim in raising question was to find new
                and simple procedure to facilitate clearance of Allied nationals on Autobahn and
                railroad and to avoid incidents in future of kind which had been common prior to
                last meeting with him of political advisers July 11.<note n="4" xml:id="d207fn4">See
                    <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note> Kotsiuba added that he could not
                agree with any implication that substantial changes in control system were involved
                or that Soviets were infringing on Allied rights of movement between Berlin and West
                Germany. It was now high time, he <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>went on,
                to bring order into question of control at checkpoints. He considered it superfluous
                on part of political advisers to emphasize that Ambassadors, Commanders in Chief and
                Commandants would determine necessity of travel by their nationals, since this
                question was not raised and this right was not questioned. However, documentation
                procedures must be settled quickly.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>After rather cursory examination of sample documents, Kotsiuba said he had no
                particular remarks to make or objections to raise in principle but that he would
                like to obtain clarification of certain points. He noted that he had previously
                understood that officials under whose authority travel orders being issued would not
                themselves need to sign documents but could delegate this function in each case to
                two other persons. Political advisers replied that sample signatures which would be
                provided would be of officials whose signature would actually appear on documents.
                Kotsiuba then added that travelers would of course also supply identity cards or
                passports to show they were actually persons covered by travel documents.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>French political adviser raised point re possibility in certain cases of
                Commandants also issuing travel orders with Komandirovka stamp on rear. After
                explanation, Kotsiuba agreed no objection to this practice.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba requested that five samples of each of final forms of documentation be
                given to him when they were ready for distribution to control officers, and later
                supplemented this with request that sample signatures appear on single copy of each
                type of movement order.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba made somewhat enigmatic statement, after once again glancing at form of
                stamp to appear on rear of travel order, that he did not accept any responsibility
                for political implications of these documents which had been prepared by Allies. In
                response to subsequent query as to what he meant by this, he stated that his remark
                concealed no ulterior motives and simply meant that while the proposed documents
                seemed satisfactory in principle they would have been somewhat differently drafted
                if he had prepared them. For example, he would not have used the expression “in
                connection with occupation of Berlin” (this was presumably reference to alleged
                restoration of sovereignty to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of which East
                Berlin capital).</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Kotsiuba urged that new documents be introduced as quickly as possible and
                suggested October 5 as date. He was informed that no commitment could be made as to
                any specific date when Allies might be ready to use new forms in view of
                difficulties of coordination and reproduction of forms. After stating that new forms
                did not have to be introduced simultaneously by all three countries, he gave up
                effort to obtain commitment re specific date for their introduction.</item>

                Bundespost Minister Lemmer has been quoted by several people as asking “How can we

                reportedly been advising shippers to send cargo of type being questioned by
                “Schnellpost dringend” (urgent fast mail), which would automatically result in its

            <p>466. Governing Mayor Brandt tonight called Allied Deputy Commandants and liaison
              officers urgently to Rathaus for meeting which began at 2330 hours. Also present were
              Deputy Mayor, members of Senat, Berlin Police Chief, prominent Berlin Party leaders
              and chief representative of Federal Republic in Berlin, Vockel.</p>
            <p>Brandt stated that reports received from German intelligence sources indicated that
              at dawn October 26 East Berlin would be sealed off from West Berlin for period of two
              weeks. While these reports not definite they were considered sufficiently serious to
              warrant his calling meeting and having such preparations taken as were practicable.
              Immediate problem would be presented by some 35,000 border crossers who normally come
              from East to West Berlin to work. He had thought of going on radio to warn them,
              despite lateness of hour, but on balance felt this undesirable at present stage.
              Vockel added that Deutsche Nachrichtendienst (Gehlen Organization) had been receiving
              reports for some eight days about intended sector border closure but today had felt
              information sufficiently confirmed to warrant alarm.</p>
            <p>Brandt continued that reports did not indicate that any stoppage of communications
              between West Berlin and Federal Republic intended. He also said that unconfirmed
              reports of vague nature received reference possible incursions into West Berlin of
              armed <hi rend="italic">Kampfgruppen</hi> (fighting groups) but did not believe these
              need be considered at present.</p>
            <p>Brandt stated that if East Zone authorities took action of kind indicated it would be
              of greatest importance psychologically that Allies react immediately and strongly. He
              felt that action should be by Commandants to which publicity could immediately be
              given. He proposed that same group meet again at 0830 hrs October 26 if sector
              boundary closure enforced. First indication would presumably be failure to resume
              operation of S-Bahn trains from East Berlin into West Berlin on early runs beginning
              about 0400 hrs. He would remain in his office all night to receive reports.</p>
            <p>Meeting ended after some discussion of transportation problems which would result
              from closure during which Senator for Transport expressed view that West Berlin had
              sufficient reserve capacity in <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0539"/>buses and
              U-Bahn cars to meet emergency which stoppage of S-Bahn trains might bring about.</p>
            <p>Thereafter we agreed with British and French that it highly desirable that three
              Commandants make vigorous oral protest in person as soon as possible tomorrow at
              Karlshorst. Also agreed we would alert Embassies and governments re situation.</p>
            <p>Have discussed with General Hamlett who agrees that prompt action by Commandants
              necessary if closure carried out and is prepared to join his two colleagues in making
              protest at Karlshorst.</p>

                situation at the border crossings remained unchanged and the meeting at Brandt’s
                office had been cancelled. Hillenbrand noted that this incident was symptomatic of
                the tension among Berlin officials and their expectation of continuing and perhaps
                increased difficulties with the East Zone. (Telegram 505 from Berlin; <hi

                  controls were aimed at the people of the Soviet Zone and not at West Berliners.

            <p>General Taylor inquired whether in light of current reports from Berlin the
              Department’s feeling about the situation there had changed in any respect. He pointed
              out that the Russians and the East Germans have a continuing capability seriously to
              embarrass us in our access to Berlin.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that we had noted no basic
              change. The Department has not been aware of any indications that the USSR was
              prepared to create a new crisis in Berlin. Although there was an increased
              aggressiveness on the part of East Germans, the general <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512"
                facs="0540"/>policy regarding Berlin is well established and the maintenance of a
              Western position in Berlin represents a sine qua non of that policy. Technically and
              legally we insist upon Soviet responsibility there.</p>
            <p>General Taylor noted that the U.S. Army has had problems with its convoys involving
              the East Germans as well as the Russians and pointed out that the loss of a Western
              position in Berlin to the East Germans would be extremely serious.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that the Department
              submit a paper reflecting our current views on the situation in Berlin for the

              recalled, however, that the de facto incorporation of the Soviet Sector into the

              freedom of circulation between the West and the East. Although the Communists have

            <p>Some intelligence reports have referred to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              intentions to “seal off” West Berlin, but the measures which they describe indicate
              intentions only to intensify existing police and customs controls on the Sector
              borders (See 2 below), to dissuade Soviet Zone and Sector residents from entering West
              Berlin, and to route through traffic from the Soviet Zone to East Berlin around rather

            <p>While there are indications that the Communists are increasing their capability of
              controlling circulation within Berlin, this does not necessarily mean that they intend
              to carry control measures to the point of completely “sealing off” West Berlin. In
              reply to a query by a Western journalist, a spokesman of the Soviet Embassy in East
              Berlin last week characterized as “pure speculation” recent reports <pb n="514"

            <p>The Allies have had ready for some years plans for the reorganization of
              transportation, public utilities, and other essential services in the event of a final
              and complete split of the city so that the residents of West Berlin, including the
              Allies, would not be greatly hampered by the denial of facilities in East Berlin. The
              Allies would vigorously protest the sealing of the inter-Sector border and one could
              expect the Communist actions to be strongly denounced in the German and world

            <p>In connection with the East German currency reform of October 13, 1957, the East
              Berlin authorities interrupted travel between East and West Berlin and between Berlin
              and Western Germany for the better part of one day and subsequently intensified police
              and customs controls on the Sector borders in order to prevent the “smuggling” of
              currency. These controls have been only partially successful. While the controls are
              still severe, they are less stringent than when first imposed. The <gloss

              through West Berlin. (The S-Bahn is an East German operated rapid transit railway
              which serves not only Berlin but also the surrounding Soviet Zone area.) As far as
              West Berlin use is concerned, both S-Bahn and U-Bahn (city subway) service are
              operating as usual, but there have been intensified spot-checks in the East Berlin

            <p>Intelligence reports have been received indicating that the East German authorities
              will discontinue through trains from the Soviet Zone via West Berlin to East Berlin,
              routing them around West Berlin instead. Reports have also been received indicating
              that arrangements are being made to interrupt S-Bahn service at the Sector borders in
              order to facilitate the further control of passengers from East to West Berlin, a
              measure which could affect S–Bahn service in West Berlin. The East Berlin authorities
              and press have also threatened punitive action against some of the 38,500 East Berlin

            <p>The measures mentioned in the foregoing paragraph have been threatened or rumored in
              the past without the East Germans carrying them out. Arrangements for the total
              control of S-Bahn traffic, for example, were made and then abandoned a couple years
              ago. In view of the technical as well as political problems involved in a complete
              check of all passengers, it is doubtful that the East Berlin authorities will actually
              attempt a total control. On the other hand, the re-routing of S-Bahn through trains to
              by-pass West Berlin is more likely. Action may be taken against certain East Berliners
              employed in West Berlin, but a sweeping action against all border-crossers is less
              likely. The severity of controls on the East Berlin side of the Sector border is
              likely to fluctuate as heretofore. At times, for example while the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is still carrying out its currency reissue, during the
              Christmas season, or when large fairs and exhibits are held in West Berlin, these
              controls will be quite intense. At other times they will slacken off. The physical
              problem of controlling the Sector border is such that the East Germans will have to
              continue to rely on spot checks coupled with threats and other psychological
              pressures.</p>

              with the “sealing off” of West Berlin from the Federal Republic or East Berlin, but
              increased restriction of circulation within the city will be met by Allied protests at

              Russian organizations [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
              were apparently being sought specifically by the Soviets. The Soviet Commandant in
              Berlin protested to the Allied Commandants against “illegal” shipments on the

              Soviet protest by protesting in turn against the interference with interzonal postal

              somewhat near present levels for a period of about six months. Tripartite plans, which
              have been coordinated with the German Federal Government, also exist for the operation
              of an airlift if necessary. A tripartite study has been made in Germany to determine

            <p>About a year ago, the Soviets complained that “unentitled” persons were using the

              Berlin-Helmstedt Autobahn <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"/>under Allied orders
              and insisted that all travellers have “proper documentation”. Some time later they
              also requested more detailed documentation for baggage and freight cars on military
              passenger trains. The Soviets have also insisted that not only the officers but also
              the enlisted personnel of American truck convoys show their identity cards at the
              Autobahn checkpoints. (The British and French had always done so.) During the past
              year, the Soviets have frequently resorted to minor harassments and to threats (which

              East German publications have also printed articles regarding “air sovereignty”,
              claiming that existing arrangements for Allied aircraft flying to Berlin are temporary
              and exceptional, and that the Western Powers have violated these arrangements by using
              the corridors for normal civil as well as military flights.</p>

            <p>Under protest, the Allies have shown to Soviet control officers the travel orders and
              identity documents of passengers on military trains. The Allies have also entered into
              a series of discussions with the Soviets regarding the documentation of Allied
              travelers. It is hoped the new procedures will be put into effect shortly and will be
              found satisfactory by both the Allies and the Soviets. Although the advertising of
              military leave tours to Berlin has been discontinued, there has been no significant
              change in the nature or volume of Allied travel. In order to put ourselves in the best
              legal and moral position for meeting effectively any Soviet challenge, we have ceased
              carrying on military trains non-official shipments of printed matter (known as “<gloss

              military authorities have protested to the Soviet military authorities against the

            <p>There is little indication that the Soviets intend any serious interference with
              Allied access per se at the present time. Their willingness to engage in discussions
              regarding Allied documentation suggests that they do not intend entirely to repudiate
              their obligations under Four-Power agreements on access. The Allied right of access,
              the Soviets argue, applies only to persons who are members of the Berlin garrisons (or
              members of the households of such persons), to persons travelling to or from Berlin on
              official duty and to the freight shipments consigned to or from the Berlin garrisons.
              By implication their position is that the clearance of all other travelers and
              shipments is a matter for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It appears from the
              Allied-Soviet documentation talks, however, that the Soviets are probably willing, as
              a face-saving device, to accept a documentary formula which will permit all Allied
              official personnel now travelling to Berlin (including those on leave) to continue to
              do so. While it is quite possible we may have to face continuous annoyance and minor
              harassment of the type experienced in the last year, there is at present no conclusive

            <p>A review of the situation described suggests that, while the Soviets have not
              abandoned their ultimate objective of undermining the Allied position in Berlin and
              eventually absorbing free Berlin into the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, they
              are concentrating on building up the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and appear
              for the moment to be resigned to tolerating most aspects of the Berlin status quo. The
              Soviets are no doubt deterred from taking drastic action against Berlin by their
              realization of the Allies’ (and especially the United States’) determination to
              maintain the status of the city and free access to it, by their awareness of
              preparations (for example the stockpiles) to meet increased harassment of the city, by
              their experience of the Berlin blockade and airlift, and by a realization of the
              impression they would make on German and world opinion. Violations of Berlin’s status
              and harassment of Berlin access will be regular features of Berlin’s life as long as
              the Communists retain control of East Germany, and they may be expected at times to
              create critical situations. The situation described above is not yet, however, one
              with which the Allies and the German authorities cannot cope on the basis of existing
              procedures. The problems which are actual or appear imminent may be said to involve
              the annoyances which are part of the price of maintaining Berlin as an “outpost of
              democracy” in the Soviet Zone rather than a prelude to a Communist attempt to swallow

              to the correctness or adequacy of basic United States policy regarding Berlin.
              Appropriate plans exist or are being developed to meet all present or imminent
              problems. The possibilities of planning in detail for all contingencies are limited.
              There is an infinite variety of forms in which problems may arise reflecting the
              inherent complexity of our position in Berlin. The extent to which general policies
              can be implemented is conditioned by the tripartite nature of our position in Berlin.
                [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] As far as more
              serious problems which might ultimately develop are concerned, present planning or
              that now under way seems to be as adequate as it can be made at this stage. The
              implementation of <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0548"/>plans to meet a grave
              situation would necessarily involve decisions which could only be taken at the highest
              level in the light of all the circumstances obtaining at the time.</p>

            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> greeted Senator Hertz
              cordially recalling their former conversation in Boston.<note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2"
                >The conversation has not been further identified.</note></p>
            <p>Senator Hertz then stated that he wished to speak mainly about the economic condition
              of Berlin, but that he had a word on the political situation as well. He stated that
              their new mayor, Willy Brandt, was a moderate Socialist and represented a position in
              the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> which was little removed from that of the
              majority party. He said that in view of this and the future that lay ahead of Brandt
              as a political figure, it might be useful for him to visit this country. He stated
              that a knowledge in America of his position on foreign policy and his stand in the
              Socialist Party might be reassuring to America in view of the fact that they must
              recognize that the Socialist Party might grow in importance in the coming years.</p>
            <p>Senator Hertz then went on to state that the economic condition of Berlin was
              approaching normal; that unemployment was reduced almost as much as could be hoped in
              the light of the extraordinary situation of Berlin; and that confidence had grown to a
              point where private money was flowing into industry and counterpart could be used for
              marginal needs.</p>
            <p>Senator Hertz stated, however, that it was of great importance that the Berliners and
              others recognize that the United States was continuing to support Berlin. He said that
              this was not always obvious to everyone; that such projects as the Library, the Ford
              Building at the Free University, the Garment Center, and the Congress Hall were all
              examples of American cooperation and support which could be recognized by everyone. In
              this connection, he stated that he had <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0549"/>been
              asked whether the Berliners felt it was appropriate for the American Flag to fly
              outside the Congress Hall. He stated that he thought this was a welcome evidence to
              the Berliners of American support and that they would be reluctant to see any change
              in this situation.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said, “Then you consider
              American aid symbolic of important political realities?” Senator Hertz agreed that
              this was the main and important function which was essential to continuing the present
              favorable trend in Berlin and to maintaining the spirit of the Berliners.</p>

              <item>Under existing treaties and U.S. policies, an attack on Berlin would involve the
                United States in war with the USSR. The Soviet rulers probably would not use Soviet
                forces to drive the Western powers from Berlin unless they had decided on war for
                reasons other than their desire to control the city.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Short of direct military attack, the USSR has the capability of making the
                Western position in Berlin untenable by restricting Western access to the
                city.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>The United States, the U.K. and France demonstrated their determination to stay
                in Berlin when the USSR blockaded the city in 1948. Although the military posture of
                the Allies was too weak at that time to permit the forceful assertion of the Allies’
                right of surface entry into Berlin, counter measures were taken by the Allies,
                especially the Berlin airlift, which caused the Soviet Union to lift the blockade.
                In view of the past and of outstanding commitments, the Allies could not afford to
                permit themselves to be driven from Berlin.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Since the end of the blockade in 1949, there have been several developments
                which affect Western capabilities in Berlin. <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0550"/>

                  <item>The Kremlin leaders have been put on notice that the United States is
                    determined to remain in Berlin and will use the necessary measures to protect

                  <item>The Soviet Foreign Minister in 1949 joined in a “quadripartite gentlemen’s
                    agreement” which was a “moral and political undertaking” not to reimpose
                    restrictions on access to Berlin. Reimposition of a blockade would violate the
                    Soviet Government’s acceptance of this agreement, which was embodied in the
                    modus vivendi for Germany of June 20, 1949.<note n="4" xml:id="d213fn4">For

                  <label>d.</label>
                  <item>Since 1949 the Soviets have taken various measures which would reduce the
                    effect of the counter-blockade measures used by the Allies in 1949.</item>
                  <label>e.</label>
                  <item>A stockpile has been accumulated in Berlin to lessen the vulnerability of
                    the city to a blockade. Emphasis has been placed on commodities difficult to
                    airlift, those of great bulk such as grain and coal and selected industrial
                    materials. The present plan for the composition of the uncompleted portion of
                    the stockpile presupposes that the stockpile will be supplemented by an airlift
                    during a blockade.</item>
                  <label>f.</label>
                  <item>Soviet capabilities of interference with an airlift, particularly in the
                    field of electro-magnetic warfare, have considerably improved since 1949, but
                    now, as then, the possibility of imposing a total blockade depends upon the
                    readiness to force down Allied planes in agreed corridors, with all the
                    implications of such acts. In addition, an airlift would involve high costs in
                    military readiness. A full-scale airlift with the stockpile could sustain Berlin
                    for a considerable period of time; but nonetheless it is doubtful that the
                    institution of an airlift would cause the Soviets to discontinue a blockade
                    which might be imposed now.</item>
                </list></item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Therefore the reimposition by the USSR of a blockade or severe harassing
                measures would be a deliberate challenge to the Western powers’ position in Berlin.
                Moreover, the prestige of the United States as the leader of the free world is
                deeply committed in Berlin. If the Soviets initiate harassing measures to restrict
                access to Berlin, it will be of crucial importance to demonstrate at once the firm
                intent of the United States not to tolerate such action. If Soviet harassment
                nonetheless continues to threaten Western access to Berlin, the security interests
                of the United States and its Allies will require them to take immediate and forceful
                action to counter the Soviet challenge, even though such countermeasures might lead
                to general war.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>At this time, the U.K. and France will not be willing to go to war or to support
                actions likely to lead to war until they are satisfied: <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523"

              <item>In taking actions to maintain the Allied position in Berlin and to avoid war, or

                  <label>b.</label>
                  <item>Most courses of action can be carried out only with the united effort of the
                    Allies. Divergence of views with the U.K. and France or with other <gloss
                      target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers must be reconciled on the basis of a
                    clear understanding that the Soviet aggression is serious and that united
                    Western support of local or general action is essential to a collective security
                    of the free world. Although U.S. actions must seek to retain Allied cooperation,
                    the United States must be prepared to act alone if this will serve its best
                    interests.</item>
                  <label>c.</label>
                  <item>The Soviets may seek by every means to obscure their responsibility for
                    renewed tensions in Berlin, by alleging that they are merely reacting to Western
                    moves or by using East German forces.</item>
                  <label>d.</label>
                  <item>Because the world situation is different from that during the previous
                    blockade, the period between initiation of aggressive actions and the “show
                    down” is likely to be short. During this period, therefore, diplomatic, military
                    and mobilization actions should be speeded up.</item>

              these points again at this time with British and French Embassies here, who are
              committed already by instructions from their governments.</p>
            <p>I was under impression all Berlin access questions were now under high level review
              Washington and there might be opportunity for departures from previously established
              positions. If such departure involved fundamental change from previous tripartite
              understandings, it seemed to me that consultation directly with French and British
              Governments via Washington would result in speedier conclusions being reached. Of
              course, simultaneously we could argue with Ambassadors here.</p>
            <p>There has been a visible tightening up regarding Berlin access, for six months or
              longer, by Soviets and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It now appears probable
              (see Deptel 1672<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">Not printed. (Department of State,
                Central Files, 661.62B/12–1757)</note> amongst others) that <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> will shortly assert pretensions in this connection that could prove
              very troublesome. The Soviets are probing again. More might become involved than
              recognizing authority of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at check
              points, for steps could be taken by Soviets and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              prejudicial to freedom of whole passage, Allied and otherwise, from one sector and
              zone to another.</p>
            <p>One can only surmise what might happen. I would guess the Soviets would probe first
              at one point and then at another. Where they meet firm resistance they might abandon
              an attempt and try elsewhere. Where they succeed initially, it would be logical to
              suppose they would develop their advantage. Furthermore, we have in almost every case
              of harassment during past year had some form of advance warning of threat from Soviet
              officials. Our people in Berlin would be able to respond much more forcefully and
              perhaps thereby create deterrent to prospective Soviet action if Mission had been
              instructed that our policy was to turn trains back.</p>
            <p>It is on such reasoning that I base view of the advisability of turning military
              trains back, rather than capitulating to the first demand (if it is ever made) but to
              admit, even under protest, the right of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials
              to determine our military rail operations.</p>
            <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0556"/>
            <p>I am thoroughly aware that this question is one of speculative judgment. It could be,
              as stated in Deptel 1675, there are no “new developments or arguments which would
              warrant change of decision already taken”, but I think this statement is
              vulnerable.</p>
            <p>My suggestion is that previous decisions should be periodically reviewed in matters
              as important as this one, even in the absence of new developments. In this case, I
              believe there have been some recent changes in the situation. Every evidence, and even
              positive steps already taken in Berlin, points to (a) hardening of control over
              civilian passage between East and West Sectors and East and West Zones; (b) an
              increasing insistence on the part of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> that Soviets
              turn over machinery of controls, and a tendency on part of Soviets, even if they may
              be sometimes reluctant, to accede to such demands.</p>
            <p>Again one can only conjecture whether Soviets would ever relinquish their own
              supervision over Allied military train and aircraft movements. There are many reasons,
              stemming mostly from quadripartite agreements and customs, as well as from distrust of
              fidelity of some <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials, which might cause them
              to retain their domination in these respects. Also, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> communiqué<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">For text of the <gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, December 19, see Department of State
                  <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 6, 1958, pp. 12–15. This communiqué
                reaffirmed the October 23, 1954, declaration “which had in view the establishment on
                a firm basis of the security and freedom of Berlin.”</note> offering prospect of
              Foreign Ministers meeting may influence Soviets against any intermediate aggressive
              activities. But we must be prudently prepared for action to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Another new factor is the augmented fear in Berlin of what new directions might be
              given by the Soviets and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to their previous
              policies there. This has been apparent in public speeches and private conversations,
              and was reflected, for example, at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting
              by the Chancellor’s desire for a reaffirmation of American support for the city.</p>
            <p>Gaston Coblentz of <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> European edition has
              severely, though I think unjustly, criticized the weak reaction of the Allies to
              Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> moves in Berlin. Mayor Brandt, as you
              know, only a few weeks ago was in a state of greatest alarm over the situation. The
              search of mail cars on the ordinary trains alarmed the public. The condemnation of
              currency holdings did not allay anxieties.</p>
            <p>Nothing is easier than to obtain views of Federal Republic or Berlin officials on
              this situation. Their expressions flow unsolicited. Three nights ago at my house,
              Ministers Lemmer (All-German Affairs) and Lindrath (Federal Economic Properties), and
              the State Secretary for All-German Affairs Thedieck, whom we had hoped to interrogate
              on other subjects, talked until midnight about the problems <pb n="529"
                xml:id="pg_529" facs="0557"/>that might arise if the Soviets transferred
              responsibilities in the Berlin area to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
              Thedieck was in favor of military trains going through by force, but entirely
              uncertain as to how that could be accomplished. Another sponsored a temporary airlift
              while the Soviet Government was being approached. But all felt, and Lemmer is a
              Berliner, the loss of face consequent upon immediate yielding to <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> demands would, in its public repercussions, be far
              greater than what would ensue if military trains were turned back, even though we
              eventually acceded to Soviet pressure.</p>
            <p>Nor should we forget the value to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of Federal
              Republic trade. If promptly mobilized, in support of a United States turnback policy,
              the threat by Federal Republic of a diminution of such trade could be formidable.</p>
            <p>I am fully conscious of the difficulty of persuading, in case the United States
              Government should sponsor a turnback, the British and French Governments to this point
              of view. The British, always pragmatic, prefer, certainly in this instance, the easy
              solution. What intermittently motivates French policy in the German context, I do not
              profess to know.</p>
            <p>I realize the necessity of a coordinated Allied approach to Berlin problems, and do
              not advocate a unilateral stand destructive of unity. But if we felt strongly about
              this, would it not be worthwhile to appeal to our associates to review their
              positions? Certainly, they would regard overtures to them to reconsider as urgent this
              hypothetical thesis a Cassandra cry. Despite this, our unique standing in Federal
              Republic imposes an obligation upon us to assert leadership. If a mistake in
              collective judgment is committed, it is not the British and French who will be held
              responsible—the onus will largely fall on United States.</p>
            <p>I trust questions to which I have made reference will never arise. This is quite
              possible. But I do want to take the liberty of repeating that, divided as opinion
              internal and external is on this subject, I feel we should reexamine what we had
              previously decided. If we adhere to current attitudes, and a crisis occurs, we will be
              afterwards declared to have been pusillanimous in having softly accepted the perhaps
              inevitable brutality without having at least first brandished our big stick even in a
              futile manner. It is the first step that counts.</p>

              up to now to review established policies in existing contingency plans. If you feel

              and Berlin that principal objective of measures recently taken in East Zone is to
              consolidate Soviet position by improving standing of regime and establishing greater
              control over population. (Berlin’s 559, 608 and 654 to Bonn, rptd Department 601, 658

              greater recognition as “sovereign state” could well impinge on Allied movements and
              lead to collision involving us.</p>
            <p>We are keenly aware of nervousness which has existed in Berlin in recent months and
              doubts which have been expressed regarding firmness of our intention to defend Berlin.
              It appears to us that these doubts stem from mistaken view that American attitudes
              toward USSR have been affected by Soviet missile capabilities and that US would
              hesitate to react to attack on Berlin or for that matter <gloss target="#t_FedRep1"

            <p>Action to be taken in event of substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              for Soviet personnel at check points on recognized train and Autobahn routes was
              worked out by High Commission in 1954 following announcement by Soviets that they
              would regard <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as sovereign. This planning, which
              was approved by Governments in August 1954, has been under review by three Embassies
              in Bonn (which have been in frequent touch with Three Governments) since Soviet-<gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreements of 1955 and Bolz–Zorin letters.<note n="7"
                xml:id="d216fn7">See <ref target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> As we understand
              it, this review is virtually complete. While it has resulted in alteration of details
              as to some points, it does not change basic approach adopted in 1954 report.</p>
            <p>Agreed tripartite policy is that, if Soviets substitute <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> personnel for their personnel at check points, we will insist on
              exercise of our rights under quadripartite agreements in accordance with existing
              practices. We would at same time make clear to Soviet Government that we continue to
              hold it responsible for implementation of Four Power agreements and for our free
              access to Berlin. This basic position is in line with Foreign Ministers Declaration of
              September 1955 and notes sent by Three Governments to Soviet Government in October
                1955.<note n="8" xml:id="d216fn8">For text of the statement issued on September 28,

                  >ibid.,</hi> October 17, 1955, p. 616.</note> We would in effect treat <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as agents of Soviet authorities. We would
              show them same documents which we now show Soviets as evidence that we are exercising
              our rights. We would not allow <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to
              control our movements, in sense of going behind our documents and making decisions as
              to what personnel could travel on trains or autobahn or what goods could be carried,
              just as we would not permit Soviets to make these decisions. There is therefore no
              question of recognizing “authority” of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials
              at check points.</p>
            <p>Basic theory behind this position is that, if there is to be interference with our
              right of access to Berlin, we would act as far as possible to force on Soviets or
                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> responsibility for actual physical interference
              with our movements in preference to stopping movements ourselves (“self-imposed
              blockade”). Various factors have entered <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0560"/>into
              establishment of this position and perhaps reasoning on part of all who have been
              involved in process is not identical. It does however represent carefully considered
              and agreed tripartite position which has been followed consistently in our planning
              and in our communications with Soviets. As you are aware, there are other possible
              situations where we would favor turning trains back rather than submit to Soviet
              demand. These would include, for example, Soviet demands which would allow them rather
              than us to determine who could travel on trains. In such cases we would not be
              prepared to acquiesce after an initial protest.</p>
            <p>Specific issue which you have put up to us, as we understand it, is whether in event
                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel are substituted for Soviet personnel
              at check points, we should for some limited period refuse to deal with <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel and turn trains back in hope of causing
              Soviets to reverse their position. (Same issue would of course arise on Autobahn.) If
              this action were not effective, we would after 72 hours or possibly somewhat more,
              acquiesce in situation. Whether action would be effective in making Soviets back down
              could not be known unless it were tried. We have some doubts as to whether it would be
              effective if substitution of personnel resulted from announced Soviet-<gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreement or had otherwise become publicly known with
              effect of committing Soviet prestige. Question at issue is whether we should risk loss
              of standing which would be involved in ultimate acquiescence if our initial stand were
              not successful in bringing about change in Soviet position. We think we would be
              better off if we insisted on exercise of our rights, even though this involved dealing
              with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at check points as Soviet agents,
              than if we publicly took position we would not do so and abandoned it in short
              time.</p>
            <p>Believe it would be desirable however to obtain considered view of German government
              on this subject. Request you concert with British and French on approach to Foreign
              Minister to solicit his and Chancellor’s views at earliest feasible date.</p>

                  xml:id="pg_534" facs="0562"/>that Allied troops should conduct normal activities
                insofar as practicable. Necessary security measures should be left to the discretion

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
            <p>Despite the considered opinion of Berlin observers that the probability is slight
              that there will soon be another occurrence of mass revolt in the Soviet Zone, it is
              believed useful for planning purposes to consider what action the United States should
              initiate in the event of a mass uprising at some future date. Events in Austria and
              the Federal Republic of Germany coupled with continued dissatisfaction over internal
              economic and political conditions might eventually lead to such an uprising in East
              Germany.</p>
            <p>It is contrary to US policy for US troops or officials abroad to instigate such an
              uprising or to seek to aid and abet it through participation therein. In brief, this
              rules out incitement to open revolt involving dangerous personal risk and restricts
              psychological warfare activities to the maintenance of the resistance potential of the
              East German population. The purpose of this paper is to suggest supplementary courses
              of action of a positive nature for consideration and development within the <gloss

            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item><p>Action might be planned now here and in the field to dramatize the concern of
                  the Western Powers over the plight of the East Germans and free world recognition
                  of the fact that this plight can be fully ameliorated and East German hardships
                  finally set aside only through the reunification of Germany. For instance a
                  meeting at a high level with the Soviets should be requested and the request
                  publicized. To be effective, the meeting should be called immediately following a
                  general uprising in the Soviet Zone. This should not be a mere propaganda gesture
                  based on the supposition that the Soviets would reject the proposal but should be
                  prepared as fully as practicable in advance so that delay at the time of the
                  outbreak could be kept at a minimum, and should be designed to bring about German
                  settlement on terms acceptable to the West. If the Soviets should refuse to come
                  to such a conference, it could increase East German resistance and might force the
                  Soviets to make greater internal concessions and at the same time would
                  demonstrate to West Germans and the rest of the world the emptiness of Soviet
                  propaganda concerning German reunification. If they did come to such a conference
                  it should be difficult for them to maintain the position that the
                  twice-discredited East German regime should play a prominent part in preparing a
                  German settlement.</p>
                <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0563"/>
                <p>It had originally been thought that such a meeting could be held at Heads of
                  Government level but in view of the recent decision to hold a Heads of Government
                  meeting for broader purposes we believe that were an uprising to take place in
                  Eastern Germany prior to the now planned Four-Power meeting, it would be
                  inappropriate to suggest a meeting at the summit in this connection. A possible
                  meeting of Foreign Ministers was also considered as an alternative to a meeting at
                  the Summit. Whichever approach is made it would require advance approval of the
                  French, British and West German Governments. It would also require preparation of
                  a common Western position concerning a German settlement. Such a position is
                  currently only in the preliminary process of formulation preparatory to the
                  forthcoming talks with the Soviets some time after mid-July. The effectiveness of
                  such a proposal later this year would in part depend on the outcome of the next
                  conference. It would also depend on coincidence of circumstances otherwise
                  favoring such a conference which cannot now be predicted. It is therefore
                  recommended that this proposal be held in abeyance for the time being and reviewed
                  in the light of the results of the forthcoming conference with the Soviets and
                  conditions then existing in the Soviet Zone.</p>
                <p>In the event that mass revolt should meanwhile occur in East Germany, it is
                  recommended that a meeting of the British, the French and the US Ambassadors and
                  the Soviet High Commissioner be called immediately. Furthermore, agreement might
                  be reached on a statement to be issued by the Heads of Government immediately
                  after the outbreak of such a revolt pointing to reunification of Germany in
                  freedom as the only basic and lasting solution to this recurring problem. A brief
                  resume of positive Western effort to achieve reunification over the past ten years
                  and of Soviet intransigence in the matter should be included. Soviet actions which
                  are in direct contradiction to their professed support of German unity such as
                  current Berlin road tolls and past restrictions on East-West freedom of movement
                  and contact should also be highlighted in such a statement. A meeting to dramatize
                  Western concern over the plight of the East German population might in such a
                  situation then be held at the Ambassadors level to utilize one or more of the
                  approaches outlined under the following section.</p></item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Another approach to the problem of a positive US reaction to an East German
                uprising would be to propose ways and means of removing the lesser causes of
                discontent without implying that such measures could ever be a substitute for
                reunification and freedom. For example if it is common knowledge at the time of a
                mass demonstration that certain food items are in seriously short supply the US
                might unilaterally direct a campaign toward suggesting technical and organizational
                improvements in the agricultural system of the <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536"
                  facs="0564"/>Soviet Zone. Under this we might insist on greater freedom and
                benefits for the farmers, adoption of machinery and modern processes which would
                improve both production and distribution of agricultural products and greater
                emphasis on the needs of the consumer as compared to heavy industry. Appropriate US
                agencies might explore now the possibility of making some limited offer at the time
                of the uprising of technical assistance with the proviso that repressive quotas and
                other coercive methods by which Soviet Zone authorities extract produce from the
                farmers be dropped. The US might also insist that special food rations for the
                privileged officials of party and government also be abandoned in the interest of
                equal distribution for all. Propaganda and other maneuvers in this field will be
                most effective if they offer realizable alternatives as challenges to the existing
                regime.</item>

              <item>Following an uprising, a similar campaign might be directed against work norm
                increases by suggesting in some detail the advantages of creating worker incentive
                through higher wages and better working conditions. The line should be that pressure
                on workers was misplaced and should instead be brought to bear on the management of
                the plant to adopt efficient production techniques and machinery. It could be
                pointed out that in addition to doing away with inhumane demands upon the individual
                worker this combination of factors would lead to better quality production at a
                higher rate. Again emphasis should be placed on the advisability of satisfying
                consumer demand in preference to forced concentration on heavy industry. The
                financial and technical organization of a typical Western consumer goods factory
                might be outlined as a sample of what Soviet Zone authorities could do for the
                workers and for the consumers if they so desire. Plans should be drawn up now for
                technical assistance, if considered desirable and on condition that Soviets agree to
                reduce working hours, raise pay and expand production of consumer goods.</item>

            <p>On September 17, a German Democratic Republic delegation, headed by Otto Grotewohl,
              Walter Ulbricht, and Lothar Bolz, arrived in Moscow for a State visit. On September
              20, the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union signed a treaty restoring
              sovereignty to the former. At the same time Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin and Foreign
              Minister Bolz exchanged letters clarifying the control functions in the Soviet Zone of
              occupation. For texts of these documents, see <hi rend="italic">Otnosheniia,</hi>

            <p>In reaction to these events, the United States consulted with the British, French,
              and West Germans concerning possible responses. One step was consultations in New York
              by the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the
              Federal Republic which resulted in a statement on September 28 reiterating the
              responsibility which the Soviet Union had in Germany and repeating that only the
              Federal Republic of Germany constituted a freely-elected government capable of
              speaking for the German people. A second step was the drafting at Bonn of identic
              tripartite notes reaffirming these same principles. The notes were delivered to the
              Soviet Foreign Ministry on October 3.</p>

            <p>[Here follows discussion of European security.]</p>
            <p>Brentano said that he would like to mention a second question of some concern to the
              Germans, namely, their fear that the transfer of quadripartite rights and obligations
              from the Soviets to the Pankow regime, which appeared to be the effect of the recent
                Soviet–<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreement,<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2"
                >See the editorial note, <ref target="#d218"><hi rend="italic"
                >supra</hi></ref>.</note> would cause difficulties with regard to Berlin. This would
              not necessarily amount to a reimposition of the blockade, but all the world knew how
              easy it was to impose harassments and impede traffic to Berlin. Brentano was most
              grateful for the declaration made in New York on Wednesday and a note which he
              understood would be delivered to Moscow. He hoped the United States would follow this
              situation very carefully, especially with regard to any possible violations of the
              1949 agreements of the Foreign Ministers.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">Presumably a
                reference to the communiqué, dated June 20, 1949, printed in <ref

                  III, p. 1062</ref>.</note> There was much concern in Berlin, which could develop
              in a way that would be politically harmful. He had spoken with Governing Mayor Suhr
              just before leaving Germany, and he would be grateful if he might report to Suhr that
              the Secretary was following this situation carefully. Suhr was apprehensive of a
              crisis in Berlin.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we shared the concern expressed by Brentano, particularly
              with regard to the ostensibly greater authority given to the Soviet Zone regime. That
              group (the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) was in a position to turn on and off
              economic pressures on Berlin in a way that could be very disturbing and that could
              shake the confidence of business people in their ability to do business on a reliable
              basis with Berlin. It had occurred to us that the Federal Republic could organize
              itself more effectively to exert economic countermeasures. The Federal Republic had
              the greater part of the trade with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and
              perhaps with resourcefulness and better organization of procedures for taking
              countermeasures, steps might be taken which could tend to deter the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from further acts regarding Berlin. The United States
              would be willing to cooperate with and back up the Federal Republic, but it seemed to
              us that the primary responsibility lay with the Federal Republic, because it was the
              most immediately concerned and had the most economic relationships with the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Brentano said that this was self-understood, and that the Federal Republic would
              certainly have recourse to certain economic counter-measures if or when something was
              started by the East Zone regime. On the other hand, it had to be recognized that when
              difficulties were created, this was usually upon instructions from Moscow rather <pb
                n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0568"/>than anything representing the will of Pankow.
              Therefore, he was not quite sure whether the Federal Republic’s countermeasures would
              be decisive and sufficient.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that it seemed to him to be useful not only to take
              countermeasures, but to make plans in advance for counter-measures, so that the very
              existence of these plans might operate as a deterrent. The point was not to have to
              take countermeasures but to possess plans which constituted a threat. He agreed that
              if instructions were received from Moscow, perhaps nothing would deter the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. On the other hand, one could never know for certain to
              what extent these harassments represented basic Soviet policy, or to what extent they
              represented merely a test probe to see how we would react. One could not be certain
              that countermeasures would have an effect, nor certain that they would not have an
              effect.</p>

            <p>The Soviet-DDR Treaty of September 20, 1955, and accompanying documents in many
              respects follow the pattern of the Paris Treaties and incorporate an effort to
              “legalize” in the treaty form exercise of sovereignty by the DDR. They also formalize
              and in some respects refine the Soviet proclamation of DDR sovereignty in March
                1954.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">For text of this proclamation, dated March 25,
                1954, see <hi rend="italic">Otnosheniia,</hi> pp. 377–378.</note></p>
            <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"/>
            <p>The facade of DDR sovereignty and in fact the whole Soviet position on Germany are
              basically unchanged but are now presented in ways which are or could be negotiable
              against the Paris Treaties.</p>
            <p>The Soviet Union has clearly not relinquished control over the ultimate solution of
              the German problem, but the documents provide a framework for further complicating and
              shifting bases of discussion of the problem. The framework is strong enough to support
              both efforts to transfer discussion to an East German-West German forum, as well as
              efforts to bring the DDR into any four-power discussions of it. The documents do not
              reflect Soviet intention to facilitate solution of the German problem but rather an
              intention to crystallize the status quo while keeping alive sources of discord between
              East and West Germans, among West Germans, and between the latter and the Western
              Allies, using clever appeals to German national sentiment in support of these
              efforts.</p>
            <p>The documents appear to confirm that the Soviets have no immediate interest in German
              reunification; and the pretense of accepting the principle of free elections as the
              basis therefor is omitted. While the lure of German-to-German negotiations is held out
              as a road to reunification, it is evident that the results of any such negotiation
              must be satisfactory to the Soviet Union, and it is apparent from accompanying
              propaganda that in the Communist view this is most likely to transpire if the West
              German negotiators are “peace-loving democrats” not now represented in the Federal
              Government.</p>
            <p>The documents and accompanying propaganda also include provision for entrenching and
              securing the Communist position in the Soviet Zone and its government.</p>
            <p>An effort appears to be made to preserve unimpaired Soviet commitments to the US, UK
              and France regarding Berlin and Germany as a whole, although as regards access to
              Berlin, the formulation in the Bolz–Zorin letters<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">See <ref
                  target="#d218">Document 218</ref>.</note> suggests that Allied rights may be
              considered as limited to their forces actually stationed in Berlin. It seems unlikely,
              however, that the Soviets will in the near future consider it advantageous to restrict
              existing official Allied access to Berlin, lest in doing so they weaken their ability
              to rebut Allied intervention in behalf of other matters, including non-Allied access,
              which the Soviets wish to throw into the German-to-German forum.</p>
            <p>In total context, the manner in which access to Berlin is dealt with in the documents
              suggests this matter is considered by the Soviets to be ancillary to achievement of
              other major objectives. It appears the exercise of control over, and harassments of,
              non-Allied access to Berlin may in the future be designed to supplement Communist
              efforts to force German-to-German negotiations as well as to <pb n="542"
                xml:id="pg_542" facs="0570"/>force cessation of West German and West Berlin
              activities which the Communists consider threaten the security of the Soviet Zone.
              Since, however, any or all of these Soviet objectives can also be advanced by other
              means than harassment of access to Berlin, and since the latter would be patently
              inconsistent with professed dedication to the “spirit of Geneva”, it seems likely that
              large-scale harassment will be resorted to, if at all, only when progress toward
              Soviet objectives in a larger framework has been arrested and/or the “spirit of
              Geneva” ended.</p>
            <p>Gradually increasing exercise by the DDR of control over surface access will,
              however, entail for the Federal Republic and the three Western Powers the alternatives
              of accepting the situation or reacting in ways which could place on the West the onus
              for interference with “normal” communication with Berlin.</p>
            <p>A key factor in Soviet calculations and in application of the whole range of matters
              covered in the documents will be the attitude and conduct of the Government of the
              Federal Republic. This is the subject of a separate analysis.<note n="5"

                xml:id="d221fn3">This October 18 note affirmed German Democratic Republic
                jurisdiction over its territory pursuant to the September treaty, but that Soviet
                forces would “temporarily” monitor traffic of the Western garrisons to and from
                Berlin. For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November

              sounded opinion here today in Berlin. Based on Brentano’s report on Berlin and my own
              observations, it is clear that the situation is calm here now, but unless a strong
              answer to this <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0571"/>note is forthcoming, there
              would be uneasiness in Berlin. Indeed the Berlin climate of opinion will be greatly
              influenced by the strength of the Western Powers’ answer to this note.</p>
            <p>I venture to recommend that in this answer, which I assume will be made before the
              Geneva Conference, the inconsistency will be pointed out between the two sentences
              “Parties proceeded from premise that German Democratic Republic exercises its
              jurisdiction on territory under its sovereignty, which, of course, also applies to
              communications on that territory”, and the sentence “It is self-understood that, in
              concluding above-mentioned treaty Governments Soviet Union and German Democratic
              Republic took into consideration obligations which both have under existing
              international agreements relating to Germany as whole.” I further recommend that there
              be a clear warning to the effect that the three Western Powers will hold the Soviet
              Union responsible for any interference with normal traffic to Berlin and a categoric
              rejection of the limitations contained in the Soviet statement regarding control over
              “movement between German <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and West Berlin of
              military personnel and freight of garrisons of USA, Great Britain, and France
              quartered in West Berlin.” As we have previously stated in our notes, Allied rights of
              access have not and cannot be limited to military personnel and freight of West Berlin
              garrisons and it seems of importance that this be strongly repeated at this time. In
              addition, I would recommend that the Government of the West German Federal Republic be
              committed to making definite plans in conjunction with other interested governments
              for a complete embargo on shipment to the Soviet Zone in case of any interference with
              traffic to Berlin. Furthermore, that arrangements be made so that these plans after
              formulation would become known unofficially to Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> officials. I have reason to believe that Brentano personally would not
              be adverse to this general line of procedure.<note n="4" xml:id="d221fn4">Following

                  >GDR</gloss></item>
            </list>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LFJ1">Leishman</persName> said that he had recently seen a
              letter from the British Ambassador in Bonn (apparently addressed to the Foreign
              Office) raising the question as to whether the Federal Republic is likely to be too
              rigid in its approach to the question of dealings with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> and whether we should take some attitude on this subject. He asked Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Reinstein</persName> whether he had any views on this
              matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Reinstein</persName> said that the question did not
              make entirely clear how it was envisaged that the problem would arise. He felt that it
              was a difficult one on which to generalize. He remarked that as a general proposition,
              the Federal Republic had not solicited our views on the subject of relations with the
                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Reinstein</persName> said that, speaking personally,
              it seemed to him that the question fell more or less into two different fields. One
              was the subject of contacts in the political field or contacts which had essentially a
              political motivation. This would include contacts concerning reunification or contacts
              in fields such as culture, either directly or through all-German organizations. In the
              past, the West Germans had been very much opposed to contacts of this character,
              although their attitude might conceivably change. It was contacts of such a character
              which the Soviet government had for a long time been seeking to promote, and any
              development of contacts along these lines clearly fitted into the general Soviet
              political objectives of promoting the two-Germany thesis and the illusion that German
              reunification could be achieved by direct negotiations between the Federal Republic
              and the German Democratic Republic. It did not appear to him that it would be in our
              interest for such contacts to develop, which could only result in promoting policies
              aimed at detaching Germany from the West. If the West Germans were rigid in excluding
              contacts of such a character, this appeared to our advantage.</p>
            <p>The other general area in which the problem arose is the one in which there are now
              contacts between the Federal Government and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.
              This is essentially in the field of interzonal trade, transport and communications. In
              this field, the matter is partly one in which <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0573"
              />the basic responsibility is Germany and partly one (insofar as it relates to Berlin)
              in which the basic responsibility is that of the Three Powers. Here again, he felt
              that it was difficult to generalize. However, in the case of Berlin, there are
              distinct dangers. If these contacts took a form which could be construed as
              recognition of the position of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Allied
              position with respect to Four-Power agreements which had been reasserted in the note
              which we just sent the Soviets would be undermined.</p>
            <p>In general, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Reinstein</persName> said that he felt
              that the problem was one in which it was necessary to examine the position in relation
              to specific situations. He said that a too rigid to difficulty. For example, there had
              been some feeling in the Department that the Germans had been somewhat too rigid in
              their handling of the question of relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> in the case of the road toll situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2"
                >Regarding the problem of road tolls, see <ref target="#d141">Documents 141</ref>
                ff.</note> The Department had thought that the West Germans might have been a little
              bit more forthcoming. However, he pointed out that the particular manner in which the
              problem presents itself is of some importance. In the road toll case, the discussions
              had finally broken down when the East Germans had demanded that the West German
              representative present a letter evidencing his authority over the signature of West
              German Minister of Transport. This was not the only issue involved in the breakdown.
              However, the case illustrated the manner in which the problem presents itself. The
              West Germans apparently feel very strongly that any meeting between Ministers would be
              politically out of question. The question then arises as to what degree of contact
              between Ministers of the Federal Republic and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              can be envisaged without giving rise to a political problem. This can only be
              determined in the particular case.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJJ1">Reinstein</persName> said he thought that, if the
              problem were to be looked at in a general way, we should direct our attention to the
              East in the first instance. It was not the Federal Republic which was creating
              problems in this field. They were being created deliberately by the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for political purposes, and we could expect this would
              be the position in the future.</p>

            <p>400. Heidelberg for <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>. General Dasher
              called on General Dibrova, Soviet Commandant, this afternoon at 1600 hours to protest
              regarding incident involving Congressman and Mrs. Ostertag and Congressman Boland in
              Soviet sector 27 November. Besides United States and Soviet Commandants and United
              States interpreters, only other participant in meeting was Colonel Kotsiuba, Soviet
              Deputy Commandant. Meeting lasted approximately 1½ hours and Soviet Commandant’s
              demeanor was courteous and affable at all times.</p>
            <p>General Dasher opened by reading from text of note which, we understand, has already
              been transmitted to Department by Embassy Bonn.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">The text
                of the note was transmitted in telegram 1747 from Bonn, November 28. (<hi
                  rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 762.0221/11–2855) It is printed in Department of State
                  <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 19, 1955, pp. 1012–1013.</note> Although
              General Dibrova stated that he rejected protest General Dasher nevertheless handed
              note to him and it was not returned.</p>
            <p>Dibrova stated that <gloss target="#t_Vopo1">Vopo</gloss>s had monitored staff car’s
              radio prior to incident and had established that frequent transmissions in German and
              English had been made. He stated that transcripts of transmissions had been
              accomplished. When General Dasher asked for transcripts Dibrova stated that it would
              take a few days. General Dasher denied that transmissions had taken place as alleged
              by <gloss target="#t_Vopo1">Vopo</gloss>s.</p>
            <p>Dibrova then charged that occupants of vehicle had been hostile. General Dasher also
              denied this.</p>
            <p>Dibrova stated that a law of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> required
              registration of radio transmitters. This law, he said, applied to vehicle in question.
              (He added, however, that it was unlikely that we would run into trouble in future if
              transmitters were not actually used in Soviet sector.)</p>
            <p>General Dasher stated that he looked to Soviet Commandant for authority in such
              matters and not to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Dibrova replied that East
              Berlin was capital of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, that it was part of <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was
              sovereign authority in that area; Soviet Commandant’s function in such occurrences was
              limited to liaison between <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other affected
              parties.</p>
            <p>Text of note has been released to press here in coordination with Embassy press
              officers. General Dasher proceeded immediately upon return to headquarters to hold

                xml:id="d225fn2">This telegram transmitted the text of a draft letter to Pushkin
                protesting both the detention of the Congressmen and Dibrova’s interpretation of the
                rights of the German Democratic Republic. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                762.0221/11–3055)</note> Department has not yet received full report of General
              Dasher’s conversation with Dibrova. However, on basis of information available, we
              have serious doubt as to desirability addressing question regarding status of East
              Sector to Dibrova and requesting Soviet Government’s views. Appears to us this most
              likely to result in affirmation of position that East Zone status has been changed,
              and that, once this position formally taken by Soviet Government, further measures in
              direction of incorporation Soviet Sector into Soviet Zone may follow. It is not in
              Western interest to have any change made in existing factual situation re Soviet
              Sector which would prejudice its present role in providing main point of contact
              between East Zone population and Western world. Obviously if Soviets consider it in
              their interest to do so, they will change it. However we see no point in forcing them
              into public position which would commit them to follow that course.</p>
            <p>In view of heavy publicity which has been given to Dibrova statement to General
              Dasher, we must of course make clear that our position re <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> and continued validity of Four-Power Agreements on status Berlin as
              previously stated remains unchanged. However, <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"
              />primary emphasis in further communication Soviets should in Department’s view be
              placed on wholly unwarranted treatment of American nationals involved in original
              incident. It appears to us that this should be opening and principal theme of any
              communication to Pushkin. Letter to him could refer to alleged violation of <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regulations and reject this explanation. It could refer
              to fact that our position regarding <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Four-Power
              Agreements has been made clear to Soviet Government and conclude by stating that we
              will continue to hold Soviet authorities responsible for treatment of American
              nationals in Soviet Sector of Berlin. It appears to Department that this line would
              satisfy needs for strong statement on incident without engaging in legalistic argument
              with Soviet authorities which could lead to no useful result and without in effect
              asking for confirmation from Soviet Government of statement which is unacceptable to
              us.</p>

            <p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 23. Following is summary Secretary’s
              conversation with Brentano and Hallstein December 17.</p>
            <p>Brentano said that he was most grateful for inclusion of reference to German
              reunification in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Communiqué.<note n="2"
                xml:id="d226fn2">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                December 26, 1955, pp. 1047–1048.</note> As result of Geneva, question had now
              dropped to second rank. He wondered whether Secretary envisaged making fresh approach
              to Soviets. Secretary said did not think it would be useful to do so for next few <pb
                n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0578"/>months at least, in view of strong Soviet
              position at Geneva. Perhaps question should be reviewed in spring of next year.</p>
            <p>Brentano said Zorin would arrive in Bonn Monday or Tuesday. He was convinced that
              Zorin would begin discussion of reunification at early date. He assured Secretary we
              would be kept informed. In response to question by Secretary, Brentano said he thought
              Zorin might perhaps make new proposals. Hallstein thought Soviets would take
              initiative, but perhaps not so immediately. He thought Zorin would begin by
              exploration of situation, perhaps then make economic offers, and eventually raise
              reunification question. Secretary said he supposed Soviets would try to convey
              impression that there would be advantages to Germany in entering negotiations with
              USSR, but thought that Soviet position on maintenance of division of Germany was quite
              firm at this time. Brentano agreed, but pointed out that some sections of German
              opinion would probably eventually exert pressures on government at least to listen to
              Soviet proposals. Secretary commented that if it became known in East Germany that
              Soviets were preparing to sell out <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, East German
              regime might demand assurances which might tend to off-set such pressures.</p>
            <p>Brentano expressed concern over Berlin. He thought Soviets would use pressure on city
              as means of obtaining recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He thought
                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would place increasing obstacles on traffic and
              transport to Berlin. He suggested Soviets would attempt to influence German opinion by
              taking position that if Berlin were to be maintained, Federal Republic would have to
              deal with Pankow, but this would be impossible to do. He welcomed inclusion in <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Communiqué of statement regarding joint consultation
              on Berlin problem and remarked that it might be necessary to think in near future of
              joint reaction by three powers and Federal Republic.</p>
            <p>Secretary said he understood some study was being made of economic relations between
              East Zone and Federal Republic and perhaps other Western states. He thought this very
              important line to follow. Federal Republic was strong while East Zone was weak and
              there should be areas in which Federal Republic could exert counter-measures against
              Eastern regime. Emphasized value of being prepared to take such measures and to
              letting this be known as deterrent. Said would probably require cooperation from other
              Western European countries. Hallstein said Federal Republic dependent to some degree
              on East Zone, particularly as regards brown coal. Question of counter-measures had
              been studied in connection with Autobahn toll problem. Economists had reported that
              Soviet Zone brown coal could not be replaced. He said that steel exports to Soviet
              Zone so small they cannot be used as means of pressure, and that stopping trade with
              East Zone would do more harm to Federal Republic than East Zone. He therefore
              emphasized need for concerted action. Secretary <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551"
                facs="0579"/>emphasized importance of study of possibility economic
              counter-measures. He said that if East Germans thought that Federal Republic depended
              on them, they would be encouraged take greater and greater liberties and suggested
              that Federal Republic should seek to find ways of becoming independent.</p>
            <p>Hallstein said <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> campaign for obtaining
              recognition, which has been going on for several years, is now reaching climax after
                Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreement. While resistance heretofore
              had been successful, weak points were emerging. He noted that in vote on <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> admission to <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>,
              India, Egypt and Yugoslavia had voted with USSR and Czechoslovakia for <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> admission. He also mentioned granting of consular
              functions to East German trade mission by Egypt. He said that Federal Republic had
              threatened to break relations and appeared optimistic regarding Egyptian situation. He
              said that Federal Republic would be adamant in refusing to have relations with any
              government which recognized <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, remarking there was
              no room for compromise on this issue. He said that in this field too Germans would
              need advice and welcomed consultation in committee recently established in Bonn.
              Secretary agreed that only by taking strong and clear position on this matter could
              recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> be prevented. He pointed out that
              Federal Republic is stronger than <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and that if
              other countries have to choose between two, they will choose Federal Republic.</p>

            <p>On May 29, the Soviet Foreign Ministry transmitted a note to the U.S. Embassy
              protesting the building of a tunnel from the U.S. Sector in Berlin into the Soviet
              Zone of Germany for the purpose of tapping into major Soviet communication lines. This
              followed the discovery of the tunnel on April 22 and protests by the Soviet Commandant
              in Berlin and the Commander of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany. The United
              States did not reply to these protests and took the position that it had not

                    Conferences on practical steps toward achievement of German reunification, the
                    pressure of world opinion was brought to bear on the Soviet position in Germany
                    with renewed force. By advancing a reasonable proposal combining German
                    reunification through free elections with a plan for European security, the
                    Western Powers deprived the Soviet Union of the argument that a reunified

                    position of openly rejecting free elections because they would operate against
                    the “achievements” of the East German regime. Subsequent soundings of German
                    opinion indicate that a majority of Germans throughout the country were
                    convinced by this Conference that only Soviet intransigence stands in the way of

                        elements of the population. The fact that this effect has not been universal
                        is evident in the continuous stream of refugees of all age groups from East
                        Germany which in recent months has been twice as great as during the same

                  >GDR</gloss> actions outlined under Section A indicate a major effort to reenforce

                  target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> among Western powers and uncommitted nations. We must
                anticipate continuing efforts to increase the prestige and recognition of the <gloss
                  target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and to equate this with the security and welfare of
                Europe. Berlin (see Progress Report on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5404/1)
                is an obstruction to completion of such a development and at the same time a
                vulnerable Western position likely to be exploited by the Soviet Government in
                furthering its program. Artificial though it is, the Soviet declaration of <gloss
                  target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> “sovereignty” constitutes a tactical device which the
                USSR seems prepared to use in a variety of ways over a long period with the purpose
                of seeking to divide the Western powers among themselves and from the Federal
                Republic on the German issue and eventually to cause the Western Powers to withdraw
                from a disaffected and more neutral and nationalist Germany. The Soviets, having
                purposely killed German hopes for reunification in the near future, appear to be
                content with a slow pace calculated to erode rather than frontally attack the
                Western position in Germany. They have openly stated that recognition of the <gloss

                new phase into which we have entered in competition for influence in Germany is less
                likely to be characterized by drastic actions such as a full blockade than by
                harassments similar to the road toll. Emerging from this background are the
                following major problems and difficulties.</item>

                Western Powers were no longer seriously pressing for a solution to the division of
                Germany. A basic hope that reunification will somehow eventually be accomplished

                sharply negative Soviet position on reunification, it is essential that Western

                basis. Failure to keep world opinion attuned to the injustices of a divided Germany
                would in time assist the Soviet Union in its persistent efforts to sever all

              <item><hi rend="italic">Making the Soviet Zone a liability to the USSR.</hi> Given the
                remoteness of present prospects for German reunification, the problem of making the
                Soviet Zone a liability rather than an asset to the Soviet bloc becomes increasingly
                significant. The United States Mission, Berlin, has recently recommended the
                development of a program designed to cause defection to the West of key <gloss
                  target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> technicians in industry, science, administration and
                the professions. Shortages of such skills are already sufficiently great in many
                fields to make the loss through defection of a few thousand key people a severely
                damaging blow to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> economy. Such a program
                should be carefully devised in cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany
                where appropriate arrangements to attract and place such defectors would have to be
                made. It would have to be executed in such a way as to minimize the risk of
                inspiring mass exodus or serious reduction of potential resistance leadership. It is
                proposed to initiate a review by Embassy Bonn of the possibilities of setting such a

            <p>Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> said that in view of the shortness of time and of
              the apparently non-controversial character of the proposed policy statement on East
              Germany, he would omit the usual summary statement as to the contents of this policy.
              He confined himself, therefore, to explaining to the National Security Council that,
              as in the case of the policy with respect to the Soviet satellites (<gloss
                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5608/1), the paragraph on East German policy dealing
              with the attitude of the United States toward spontaneous manifestations of opposition
              to the Communist regime and in general to active resistance to the Communist regime,
              would not appear in the policy statement which received normal distribution, but would
              be placed in a special limited distribution annex. Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName>
              reminded the Council of the reasons why, in its earlier action on the satellites
              paper, it had been deemed prudent to handle this sensitive matter in this fashion. The
              same considerations applied in the case of East Germany. (A copy of Mr.

              strike was to be considered passive resistance. He said he was particularly concerned
              that we not endorse a policy of encouraging the East German population to run risks
              and incur reprisals when we are not actually in a position to help them. This
              paragraph should be handled with great care, and the President said he would prefer to
              rewrite it to say that we should encourage passive resistance of a sort which would
              not involve reprisals against the East German population.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> made several efforts to indicate that paragraph 14
              was concerned only with passive resistance, and that the attitude of the United States
              toward resistance which involved the possibility of violence was being handled in this
              paper, as in the satellite paper, by being confined to an annex with special limited
              distribution.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName>’s explanations apparently did not reassure Secretary
                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, who still expressed the fear that if
              the contents of paragraph 14 should ever become public the Communists would be in a
              position to say that U.S. policy had actually encouraged such uprisings as had lately
              occurred in Posnan.</p>
            <p>After further discussion, it appeared to be the consensus of the Council that
              paragraph 14 should likewise be placed in the special limited distribution annex to
              the statement of policy on East Germany.</p>

            <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>Soviet control over East Germany has added to the power disequilibrium in Europe
                and thus to the threat to the security of the United States. Moreover, the continued
                division of Germany creates a serious element of instability in Europe which must be
                eliminated before a reliable and enduring basis for European security can be
                established.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>At the present time all evidence points to the conclusion that the Soviet Union
                has no intention of abandoning its position in East Germany, or of seriously
                negotiating on the subject of German reunification. It continues to maintain
                substantial military forces in the area, while representing minor withdrawals as a
                significant reduction.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>East Germany poses special and difficult problems of control for the USSR. While
                the East German regime has made limited progress in furthering its program, the East
                Germans are unlikely to accept of their own free will the Communist system which has
                been imposed upon them. A basic hope that reunification will somehow eventually be
                accomplished continues to be the main psychological support for the majority of East
                Germans in their disaffection with the Communist regime. The fact that the main body
                of the German nation in the Federal Republic has made remarkable advances in
                political freedom and economic well-being, together with the role played by West
                Berlin in providing a means of contact with the Free World, also serves to keep
                alive in East Germany the hope for an ultimate escape from Soviet domination. The
                situation in East Germany provides a showcase example of Soviet colonialism and
                furnishes opportunities for the West to exploit strong popular anti-Communist
                sentiments. Recently there have been numerous indications of unrest and uncertainty
                in the lower echelons of the East German Socialist Unity Party as a result of the
                repudiation of Stalin.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>However, as long as Germany remains divided, various factors at work in East
                Germany will operate to weaken the resistance of the <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564"
                  facs="0592"/>population to the regime. These factors include the wholesale
                Communist indoctrination of youth, the weakening under unrelenting police-state
                pressure of resistance groups now in existence, and the continuing flight to the
                West of anti-regime refugees.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>It is in the national security interests of the United States to oppose Soviet
                control of East Germany and to seek the elimination of that control by means of the
                reunification of Germany in freedom. However, the United States is not prepared to
                resort to war to eliminate Soviet domination of East Germany, nor does attainment of
                this goal through internal revolutionary means appear likely so long as substantial
                Soviet forces are deployed in the area. Thus a basic change in Soviet policy toward
                Germany will be required before a German unification compatible with U.S. security
                interests can be attained. Until this change occurs, the possibilities for U.S.
                action vis-à-vis East Germany will remain limited.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>The process by which a change in Soviet policy toward Germany may occur may be a
                very complicated one since it is closely related to many other elements in the total
                relationship between the Soviet Union and the West. However, in respect to Germany
                one essential line of action is the continued focusing of world opinion on the
                injustice of a Germany forcibly divided by the imposition of a Soviet-dominated
                puppet regime. Another essential line of action is the attempt to make more
                difficult Soviet control in East Germany, and to encourage the development of forces
                there tending to strengthen the resistance to the Communist regime. Moreover, there
                may be developments, such as the riots of 1953, which offer opportunities for
                exploitation. Such pressures upon the Soviet Union may lead it ultimately to accept
                the reunification of Germany in freedom as one of the prerequisites for the
                relaxation of international tension and as indispensable to the creation of stable
                and permanent European security.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>It is essential to this end that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                countries and, to the extent possible, non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                countries, demonstrate their support for reunification on a continuing basis. The
                United States will have to contend against the possible interest of certain
                uncommitted nations in trade connections with East Germany and combat the tendency
                of some Western European elements to favor political arrangements with the USSR
                based on a divided Germany.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>The maintenance by the free world of contact with East Germans is an important
                element in the stimulation of their resistance to Communism, confidence in the West,
                and hope for a reunified democratic and independent Germany. Imaginative and
                flexible programs will be required, permitting quick adjustment to possible changes
                in Communist restrictions on the access of the East German population to Berlin and
                West Germany.</item>

                      exploiting the Western position in the Federal Republic and Berlin.</hi>
                    Although the Soviets have relaxed some part of their overt control and have
                    permitted certain East European satellites the assumption of some attributes of
                    national independence, the Kremlin has not relaxed its grip on the German
                    Democratic Republic. The Soviet representatives in East Berlin continue to rule
                    the country through their German agents with the backing of the 400,000-man
                    occupation army. Against this overwhelming armed might the East German populace
                    is disinclined to oppose the regime openly. Steadily improving conditions in
                    West Germany and West Berlin continue to give contrast to the differences
                    between East and West Germany. <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> (Radio
                    Station in the American Sector Berlin) broadcasts and other U.S. programs for
                    keeping in touch with the East German population have served to point out these
                    contrasts. The continued flow of refugees from East Germany indicates the
                    attractive force of the West to elements in the East German population. Berlin
                    has been maintained as a show window of Western accomplishments and the city has
                    continued as the base for most programs designed to maintain contact with the
                    East Germans by means of radio (<gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>), visits
                    and various forms of aid. (See paragraphs 2–e and 2–f–(3) below.)</item>

                    constantly reminded members of the East German armed and paramilitary forces
                    that these forces are mere instruments of the Kremlin designed to further the
                    maintenance of Soviet control over East Germany. Continued disaffection in the
                    East German military establishment is reflected by the continued and steady
                    defection to the West (over 200 a month) of members and former members of the
                    East German armed forces. The East German defense establishment has not overcome
                    its inherent weaknesses of <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0597"/>poor morale
                    and low political reliability. These forces, totalling 118,000 men, cannot be
                    counted on either to engage in military action in behalf of the Kremlin or to
                    maintain internal order without substantial direct Soviet control. Reliable
                    armed forces which would be large enough to maintain internal order alone can
                    probably not be formed in the foreseeable future. The Soviet experience with the
                    Hungarian army, which prior to the Budapest uprising was regarded as
                    sufficiently dependable to maintain internal order, probably has compelled the
                    Kremlin to approach the problem of reliability of the East German armed forces
                    with even greater caution than heretofore.</item>

                      power.</hi> East Germany’s economy continues to be of great value to the
                    Soviet Union. The economic advantages accruing to the Soviet Union include the
                    normal gains from trade as well as discriminatory pricing to the advantage of
                    the USSR. In addition, the Soviet Union receives payment for its alleged
                    investment in its former corporations in East Germany, support for its troops,
                    and probably subsidies to the jointly-owned uranium mining company. (East
                    Germany supplies the USSR an estimated 45 percent of uranium available to the
                    Soviet atomic energy program.) In order to emphasize this exploitation, <gloss
                      target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> and other United States programs have been
                    designed to nourish the spirit of East German resistance to Communism and to
                    hamper Soviet exploitation of East Germany by maximum publication, both in East
                    Germany and in the free world, of the facts of such exploitation. <gloss
                      target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> and other East-West contact programs have
                    exploited the Stalin denigration campaign and publicized developments in
                    Hungary, thereby adding to the confusion and uncertainty in the lower echelons
                    of the Socialist Unity Party. The possibilities of weakening East Germany
                    through a limited program of defection of scientists and technicians are
                    currently under study.</item>

                      Germany which may contribute to U.S. interests.</hi> The East German public
                    has become noticeably disillusioned because of the failure of the West and the
                    United Nations to act in support of the Hungarians against the Soviet Union’s
                    ruthless suppression of the revolt in Hungary. In addition, resentment and
                    bitterness against the USSR is mounting and, according to some observers, is
                    evident to an even greater extent than after the riots of June 17, 1953. Against
                    this background of disillusionment the East Germans remain an essentially
                    pro-Western people who are basically anti-Communist and who will continue to
                    oppose, at least passively, the Soviet-supported dictatorship in their country.
                    U.S. programs and broadcasts designed to keep in touch with the East German
                    population have made an important contribution in maintaining the moral and

                        continued its support of special programs designed to maintain Western
                        contact with the people of the Soviet Zone and to keep alive resistance to
                        the Communist regime. There is evidence of the general effectiveness of this
                        type of program as a whole. For example, the participation of nearly 50,000
                        Soviet Zone residents at Catholic and Protestant lay conventions was made
                        possible under this program. These meetings provided one of the most
                        effective means of reaching and fortifying anti-Communists in East Germany.
                        Support continues for church activities in the East Zone, for welfare
                        programs which supply food, clothing and medicines, for visits of youth to
                        the Federal Republic, and sending of books. The Embassy at Bonn is studying
                        the impact of the individual Soviet Zone projects making up the overall

                build up the regime at home and abroad. We are still faced with the difficulty of
                maintaining the basic hope of the East German population that reunification will
                somehow eventually be accomplished—a hope which remains as the main psychological
                barrier to acceptance of the East German regime by a majority of East Germans. The

                over a 4-year period. Of this amount, however, about four-fifths is to be in the

                actually to have been made. These reductions have principally involved Soviet

                action which would yield a net loss in terms of U.S. objectives is particularly
                applicable to the present situation in East Germany. A mass revolt along Hungarian
                lines is not anticipated, and U.S. policy in Germany would not be served by
                encouraging a similar East German revolt because harsh Soviet military measures to
                repress it would be certain to follow. In addition, the situation could develop in
                such a way as to threaten involvement of the U.S. in a general war with the Soviet

                Meeting of Foreign Ministers in 1955 and the openly negative position which it has

                continued division of Germany. The United States should also continue to bring the
                pressure of public opinion and diplomatic action to bear with a view to convincing
                the Soviets that German reunification in freedom is in the Soviet interest as well
                as the general European interest. In pursuing these aims it will be necessary as in
                the past to work in close harmony with the governments of the U.K., France and the
                Federal Republic of Germany. It is in the general interest to be as aggressive and
                flexible in the promotion of German reunification as the maintenance and development
                of vital Western security requirements in Europe will permit.</item>

            <p>In seeking to undermine Soviet control over East Germany, to diminish the reliability
              of the East Germany armed forces and to minimize the East German contribution to
              Soviet power, the United States must be guided by the following considerations: the
              East German regime continues to be essentially a tool for Soviet domination of the
              area and is generally regarded as such by the whole German people; there is no
              significant popular demand in favor of Titoist evolution in East Germany nor is there
              any potentially effective national Communist leadership; and because of the strong and
              continuing German demand for reunification and the equally strong rejection of the
              East German regime, the U.S. could not, without risk of alienating all of Germany,
              adopt a course of encouraging national Communism in East Germany as a first step
              toward disengaging Soviet control. For these reasons the United States must continue
              to treat East Germany differently from other East European satellite areas and to
              resist all attempts of the Soviet government and the East German regime to gain
              international recognition for the regime outside the Soviet Bloc.</p>
            <p>To conserve and strengthen those assets in East Germany which may contribute to U.S.
              interests, the United States should continue its encouragement of democratic elements
              in East Germany by stressing the religious, cultural and social aspects of the common
              German heritage and by undertaking special projects which will maintain in East
              Germans a sense of identification with the West and which will manifest our concern
              for their hardships.</p>

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi></p>
            <p>This study, which has been prepared in accordance with paragraph 25 of <gloss
                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5616/2, is based on the hypothesis that widespread
              revolt has broken out in the Soviet Zone of Germany involving acts of violence on the
              part of the population against the Communist regime and that the regime is employing
              force to repress the insurrection. It discusses the problem of what action the United
              States should take under these circumstances. While the paper touches on the
              possibility of simultaneous uprisings in Poland, it discusses possible courses of U.S.
              action only in the event of a revolt in Eastern Germany and makes no recommendations
              for overall American policy in the event of general revolt throughout Eastern
              Europe.</p>
            <p rend="center">I. Summary Analysis</p>
            <p>1. The most significant difference between the revolt in Hungary and a possible
              revolt in Eastern Germany is that in the German situation Soviet and <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, including U.S. troops, are face to face with
              each other in Berlin as well as along the Zonal border and vital strategic interests
              of both major powers would be directly affected in a revolt. This fact simultaneously
              increases the dangers arising from a revolt and confronts the United States with a
              greater challenge than in the Hungarian situation, for in Germany we have a direct,
              recognized interest and an acknowledged legal responsibility for the country.</p>
            <p>2. It can be assumed that the East Zone regime, with the help of the massive Soviet
              forces which are at hand, would put down isolated instances of revolt, should they
              occur, with dispatch and brutality. If such short-lived isolated revolts should occur,
              the U.S. could consider <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0612"/>the courses of action
              listed in para. 24, supplemented, if considered appropriate and practicable, by UN
              action. Should, however, these incidents expand to the scale of a general
              insurrection, as in Hungary, it can be assumed—given the fact that the population will
              have risen up in spite of (a) their vivid memory of the repression of the June 17,
              1953 insurrection, (b) their knowledge of the presence of large Soviet forces in the
              Zone, (c) their awareness of the circumstances of the brutal repression in Hungary,
              and (d) their realization that the West had failed to give military aid to either the
              June 1953 or the Hungarian insurgents—that the uprising would be marked by
              considerable reckless determination. Consequently, it is possible that if the revolt
              became widespread it would continue for some time even in the face of massive Soviet
              repression. The factor of duration is of considerable importance, for the longer a
              revolt continued the higher emotional feeling would run in Western Germany and the
              greater would be the risk of serious incidents involving Soviet and <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in Berlin and along the Zonal border.</p>
            <p>3. In spite of the probable tenacity of the insurgents and the possibility that there
              might be some unauthorized flow of arms to them from the Federal Republic, there seems
              little doubt that the Soviet forces would in the end be able to repress the revolt in
              the absence of considerable assistance from the outside, either of a political or
              military nature.</p>
            <p>4. It is clear that, if a revolt in the Soviet Zone were to take place and were to be
              repressed by the Soviets, the principal loser would be the Soviet Union. This
              development would be a renewed demonstration that in Eastern Germany, as elsewhere in
              Eastern Europe, the Soviet system is maintained only by naked force and that this
              system is repudiated by the population. It would cause serious economic and political
              problems for the USSR. At the same time, emotional disappointment in Germany over the
              failure of the revolt would lead to a strong feeling of resentment against the Western
              Powers if it were felt that they had failed to act energetically during the crisis. In
              particular there would be considerable bitterness in the Federal Republic directed
              against the United States, as the leader of the Western coalition. In consequence, not
              only would German relations with the United States be adversely affected but one of
              the fundamental aspects of United States policy toward Germany—the binding of Germany
              into close alliance with the Western community—could be placed in jeopardy. Finally,
              the hopes of the Zonal population for the future reunification of Germany and the will
              to resist Soviet imperialism throughout the satellites would be gravely reduced by the
              repetition of the Hungarian situation, which in this case would have taken place on
              the doorstep of Western Europe.</p>
            <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0613"/>
            <p rend="center">II. Estimate of the Situation</p>
            <p>5. Though the basic assumption of this study is that a revolt has actually broken out
              in the Zone, this assumption is a theoretical one and it may be helpful to give a
              short analysis of the present chances that such a development will actually take
              place.</p>
            <p>6. The great majority of the population of the Zone is dissatisfied with its economic
              conditions and disaffected from the regime. While there has been a gradual improvement
              in the standard of living over the past few years, the ordinary necessities of life
              are scarce and expensive to an extent which allows the statement that there is general
              poverty in the Zone. The regime is having great difficulty with its program of
              expanding the industrial base and there is little prospect of rapid economic
              improvement. The regime has slavishly followed the Soviet line on Hungary, has
              declared that there will be no basic revisions of the Communist system in the Zone,
              and has demonstrated its nervousness about the course of events in Poland by attacking
              Polish Communist writers and journalists who have written in favor of “national
              Communism” and by arresting a number of East German intellectuals known as supporters
              of “national Communism.” There have been numerous indications that the students and
              intellectuals have been getting a clear picture of the events in Hungary and Poland
              from Western sources, mainly radio, that they have been quite excited over the
              developments in those two countries and are fully aware of the important role played
              by student groups there, and that they have objected to the line taken by the
              Government.</p>
            <p>7. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors which would appear to make a
              widespread East German revolt unlikely at the present time. Chief among these are: <list>
                <label>a.</label>
                <item>The experience of the abortive rebellion of June 17, which was put down by the
                  Soviet troops without any attempt at intervention by the Western Powers.</item>

                <label>d.</label>
                <item>The presence of massive numbers of Soviet troops in Eastern Germany who are

                  to crush any revolt.</item>
                <label>e.</label>
                <item>The constant flow of refugees to Western Germany with relatively little
                  hindrance, which drains the Zone of potential opposition leaders and at the same
                  time, owing to the knowledge that a possibility of flight exists, acts as a safety
                  valve to reduce the build-up of pressures which could lead to revolt.</item>
                <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0614"/>
                <label>f.</label>
                <item>The frequent warnings against rash or violent action which have emanated from
                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and from all responsible groups in the
                  Federal Republic.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>8. This evaluation does not exclude the possibility of isolated outbreaks. In spite
              of the factors working against widespread resistance to the regime, the situation in
              the Zone is a potentially explosive one and general rebellion could conceivably be
              touched off by a local uprising, by further developments in Hungary and Poland
              indicating a diminution of Soviet control in those countries, by outbreaks of
              wide-scale rebellion in other satellites, by indications of internal weaknesses within
              the USSR, or by a change in the present attitude of the Federal Republic to one of
              actively encouraging and instigating such an uprising.</p>
            <p rend="center">III. Political and Military Considerations</p>
            <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Attitude of the Zonal Population.</hi> The population of the
              Soviet Zone has not been won over to support of Communism. The vast majority of the
              people in the Zone are anti-Russian and bitterly opposed to the puppet regime now in
              power. Only a very small percentage of the population could be expected actively to
              support the regime in the event of an uprising. The principal targets of the Communist
              efforts to gain acceptance of their ideology—young people, the students, the
              industrial workers—are as in Hungary the most disaffected groups among the population
              and would presumably form the nucleus of any revolt.</p>
            <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Attitude and Resources of the Communist Regime.</hi> Although
              some elements of the Communist party are influenced by Titoist sentiment, the leaders
              and policy makers of the Soviet Zone regime are hardbitten Communist veterans who are
              fully committed to the Soviet cause. There is no evidence that there are organized
              groups of Titoist Communists in the Zone, and the present leaders there, who are hated
              and distrusted by the population and under great political and ideological pressure
              from the Federal Republic and more recently from Poland, know that their only hope for
              the future is to remain as closely tied to the Soviets as possible. Not only their
              political position, but their very lives would be at stake in the event of rebellion.
              The regime could, therefore, be expected to react immediately and in the most drastic
              manner to indications of widespread rebellion. In view of the unreliability of the
              East German police forces, the East Zone Government would almost certainly immediately
              request the Soviets to use their armed forces in Germany without delay in the unlikely
              event that the Soviets had not already acted independently.</p>
            <p>11. It is uncertain whether the combined police and military forces available to the
              East German regime are adequate in number <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0615"/>and
              armament to quell a general revolt throughout the country. However, the police and
              military forces could not be trusted to support the regime actively and large numbers
              would either refuse to act against the rebels or actually join them. It is possible
              that organized subordinate commands of the Peoples Army and the police would join the
              rebels and add to their military capacity. The current armament and weapons depots of
              the Peoples Armies and police forces would be a logical source of weapons for the
              rebels insofar as this possibility is not eliminated by Soviet military action.</p>
            <p>12. The East German civil police comprise approximately 80,000 men, plus about
              100,000 or more auxiliaries and armed workers that fall under its jurisdiction. The
              police generally are unreliable, as indicated by the high rate of desertions to the
              West (an average of 75 men have deserted to the West each week during the past several
              years). While the police are adequate for the normal tasks of law enforcement, they
              could scarcely be relied upon in an emergency.</p>
            <p>13. East Germany has about 30,000 frontier troops, including those used to maintain
              border controls around Berlin. They are not adequate for a complete sealing off of the
              frontier with West Germany. In an emergency they would probably not be reliable
              supporters of the Communist regime.</p>
            <p>14. The East German army is currently estimated to have a personnel strength of
              100,000. The Navy has a personnel strength of 11,000. These forces could not be relied
              upon by the Soviets for major military operations or for maintaining internal security
              in East Germany.</p>
            <p>15. The East German interior troops number about 15,000. The interior force is
              probably the most reliable of Ulbricht’s security arms, but because of its relatively
              small size has limited capabilities.</p>

              <item>The Soviet Union would probably take an even graver view of a revolt in East
                Germany than that in Hungary and in consequence would hesitate even less before
                committing its forces (numbering about 400,000 men organized in 22 divisions, which
                could be reinforced if necessary by sizeable forces drawn from the more than 50 line
                divisions in the Western part of the USSR) to repress the revolt without mercy. For
                the Soviets, a successful “counter-revolution” in the Zone would mean the sweeping
                away of their puppet regime and the addition of that area to the increasingly
                powerful Federal Republic and thus to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                area, since it would be clear from the outset that the aim of the insurgents was
                total liberation from the Soviet grip and that there was little, if any, chance of
                establishing even a Gomulka-type regime in the Zone. With the loss of the Zone as a
                military base, the political control of the Soviets over the remaining satellites,
                especially Poland and Czechoslovakia, would be <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588"
                  facs="0616"/>greatly weakened, while the success of the rebellion would most
                probably inspire further anti-Communist uprisings in the satellites. Ultimately, the
                loss of the Zone under these circumstances would probably mean the loss of Eastern
                Europe to the Soviets and the withdrawal of their forces back to their own frontiers
                without any compensating withdrawal of Western forces. While it is conceivable that
                the Soviets may in time themselves conclude that the only method by which they can
                retain a minimum amount of control over Eastern Europe is to grant further
                concessions to their satellites, successful revolt in the Zone would mean its
                abandonment to the Western sphere of influence without any opportunity for the
                Soviets to insist on conditions which would militarily protect the security of the
                USSR itself.</item>
              <label>b.</label>
              <item>The development of a situation posing the risk of losing their control over the
                Zone would therefore probably be regarded by the Soviets, under present conditions
                at least, as a major and direct threat to Soviet security. The Soviets would
                probably suspect from the outset, regardless of justification, that a revolt in the
                Zone was at least partially instigated by the United States. If their suspicion
                should be hardened by evidence, whether imagined or real, that the United States was
                actively assisting the rebellion or if there were clashes between American and
                Soviet troops, the Soviet leaders, who might already be close to panic, could take
                steps which might lead to general war. The opposite possibility also exists in
                theory. Important as the continued retention of the Zone is to them, Soviet leaders
                might themselves be so concerned over the possibility of general war that they might
                accept loss of control over the Zone if pushed hard enough by the West rather than
                risking war by using their own forces to repel all forms of Western
                intervention.</item>

              <item>With regard to the Communist countries bordering on Eastern Germany—Poland and
                Czechoslovakia—it could be assumed that their governments would probably officially
                oppose a rebellion from the outset, though for different reasons. The present Polish
                government, though its attitude might be moderated by fear of adverse reaction from
                the Polish population if it adopted too hostile an attitude to what essentially
                would be an anti-Russian revolt, would see in the rebellion a threat to its own
                policy of “gradualism” and to its Western frontiers. The Czech government would
                probably be opposed to the revolt in the light of their extreme subservience to the
                USSR and their fear of Germany. However, the time factor is of great importance in
                many respects in estimating side effects of a rebellion in Eastern Germany. If a
                rebellion in Eastern Germany continued as long as that in Hungary, there might be
                anti-Soviet demonstrations, at least in Poland.</item>

              <item>In the opposite direction, it would appear that signs of serious popular
                opposition to the government in Poland or Czechoslovakia could trigger a rebellion
                in the Zone. A situation in which the Polish government, supported by the
                population, was showing even greater independence of the Soviet Union and having new
                and severe difficulties with the Russians as a result could have similar effects in
                either triggering a revolt in the Soviet Zone of Germany or encouraging the rebels
                to continue their opposition if a rebellion had already started. A situation in
                which Polish troops were actually engaged in fighting with Soviet forces would
                clearly have a great effect in encouraging the continuation and intensification of
                rebellion in the Zone, while it could also conceivably make the military prospects
                of such rebellion somewhat brighter by draining off a certain number of Soviet
                forces into Western Poland to deal with the situation there.</item>

              <item>It is believed that the present Federal German Government, which has clearly
                shown its understanding of the risks arising from a revolt, would at the outset of
                rebellion in the Zone refrain from official action in direct support of the rebels
                and do its best (1) to prevent involvement of Federal military forces, (2) to
                channelize popular feeling in the Federal Republic into constructive relief
                projects, and (3) to discourage demands for armed assistance for the rebels as well
                as participation of individual residents of Western Germany in the rebellion. It
                would undoubtedly appeal to the United States, United Nations, and the <gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council for help and intercession, and would
                probably make a direct appeal to the Soviet Union in an effort to stop the bloodshed
                and persuade the Soviets to withdraw from the Zone.</item>
              <label>b.</label>
              <item>The Government could use radio transmitters in the Federal Republic, for which
                there is generally good reception in Eastern Germany, to beam messages to the Zone.
                The Government would also have at its disposal the remaining units of the Federal
                Border Police, which now number approximately 7,000 men, and could count on the
                cooperation of the Border Police and State Police units of the Laender to control
                the Zonal border. The armed forces of the Federal Republic, now numbering about
                70,000, are a further potential resource in times of emergency. Though the present
                government would probably be most cautious about placing its armed forces in
                situations where a clash between them and Soviet forces could ensue, about 10,000 of
                them are former Border Police personnel still stationed on the Zonal Border and
                these men might be reassigned to the Border Police. If a revolt should occur after
                the German forces have increased in size and become battleworthy, and were to last
                for some time, there might be some public pressure to use them in some way <pb
                  n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0618"/>to give direct aid to the rebels even though
                there is little prospect in the near future that the German forces would be strong
                enough to take on the Soviet forces in East Germany if the uprising were an isolated
                one to which the Soviets were able to give full attention. Even before this point
                had been reached, there would be a possibility of rash action on the part of
                subordinate unit commanders of the armed forces or the Border Police.</item>

              <item>The population of the Federal Republic has profound fellow-feeling with the
                population of the Zone which, of course, is considered an integral part of Germany.
                The West German public would react to a rebellion in the Zone and the attempts of
                Soviet troops to repress it with a mixture of fear and outrage. There would probably
                be a certain amount of panic in Western Germany arising from the fear that Soviet
                military action could spread to the Federal Republic. The public would therefore
                probably support the Government in a course of moderation at the outset, but if the
                rebellion should last for some time and fear of Soviet attack subsided, public
                opinion is sure to become more extreme and to press the government to take some more
                radical action to aid the revolt, while there may be individual or group actions to
                help the rebels directly. The longer the conflict continued, the greater would be
                the difficulty of the government in maintaining a moderate line. In the event that
                the Soviet forces could not master the situation and the revolt continued at white
                heat for over two or three weeks, there is some risk that even the most responsible
                government would begin to yield to this popular pressure and start considering more
                hazardous measures in addition to intensifying its appeal for Western help or
                military intervention.</item>

              <item>One of the most important differences between the East German and the Hungarian
                situations is the fact that the Soviet Zone has a long common border with a member
                of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance, the Federal Republic, on
                whose territory are stationed a large number of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss> forces including numerous U.S. and U.K. forces. In the case of
                Germany, this border also separates a population of the same nationality. Although
                efforts would almost surely be made to seal off the border from the East by the use
                of Soviet forces rather than by less dependable East Zone police or military units,
                it would probably be impossible to seal it along its whole length at all times and
                it may be possible to cross it both ways at various points from time to time. On the
                Federal Republic’s side of the border, agreements have been <pb n="591"
                  xml:id="pg_591" facs="0619"/>concluded between the U.S. and the Federal Border

                military forces from the Zone which are too numerous for the Border Police to handle

              <item>To illustrate the problems with which the United States may be faced in the
                event of revolt, the following list attempts to show some of the types of movements
                across the border which could occur in case of revolt in the Zone: refugees from the
                Zone, organized units of the “Peoples Army” and police seeking refuge, and “loyal”
                Peoples Army units or Soviet forces in pursuit of refugees. There may be firing
                across the border from both sides. Volunteers from Western Germany may cross over to
                the Zone, and it is possible that local units of Federal police may penetrate a
                short distance into the Soviet Zone to assist refugees in escaping. The possibility
                cannot be excluded of clashes on a localized basis between the Federal German armed
                forces and Soviet forces, as well as between U.K. or U.S. and Soviet forces along
                the border.</item>

              <item>The situation of Berlin in the event of rebellion in the Zone would be most
                critical. The city is located in the middle of the Soviet Zone. There might be
                difficulty in maintaining continuous land access to the city if Soviet forces seal
                off the Zonal border. Difficulties in connection with access to Berlin by air are
                also a possibility. The city itself can be penetrated with ease from all sides and
                it would be most difficult to have full control over its limits to control the
                movement of persons. The West Berlin police force, under the control of the three
                Western Commandants, has a total of 16,000 men who might have difficulty in coping
                with border control in the event of large numbers of refugees or of West Berliners
                going to the assistance of the rebels. However, the U.S., the U.K., and France have
                garrisons in the city totalling about 15,000 men, and legal responsibility for
                maintaining order and security in the Western Sectors of the city, and they could
                probably deal with all but the most chaotic situations. It may be presumed that the
                Soviets will exert themselves to prevent clashes between Western forces and police
                or military units loyal to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime or with
                Soviet forces. Nevertheless, the possibility of such clashes cannot be excluded in
                the confusion of revolt. As in the Federal Republic, there may be efforts to seize
                police or allied weapon stocks, in this case by the rebels as well as their West

              of developments which could lead to general war. The major justification for the

              that the revolt was not of indigenous origin, but had been instigated and supported by

            <p>23. There follows a discussion of various courses of action open to the United States
              in the event of a revolt in East Germany. In addition to certain minimum and immediate
              steps which should be taken in any case, there would seem to be three possible broad
              alternative courses of action which could be followed, which are not entirely mutually
              exclusive: (1) to attempt to negotiate, preferably in concert with the British and
              French, directly with the Soviets to obtain a definitive settlement of the German
              problem on terms acceptable to us, (2) to pursue the same objective by placing primary
              reliance on the procedures and machinery of the United Nations, and (3) to exert
              direct American pressure against the Soviets aimed at compelling the disengagement of
              their forces from the military operations to suppress the revolt and the eventual
              total withdrawal of these forces from East Germany. (The UN machinery could, of
              course, be used where practicable to give support to U.S. action taken under the
              general heading of (1) or (3) above.) All of these courses of action would have as
              their ultimate objective the establishment of a reunified German state free to

                  assistance through the UN.</item>

              </list></p>
            <p>25. If U.S. action were to be limited to the above steps it would be likely to be
              interpreted to signify the voluntary abandonment by the United States of efforts to
              control the course of developments despite the fact that they involve the risk of
              general war, and could lead to severe losses of U.S. prestige and authority through
              the free world.</p>

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Direct Negotiations with the Soviets.</hi></p>
            <p>26. The U.S. could, after consultation with the U.K., France, and the Federal
              Republic, approach the Soviet Union on the highest level either in concert or, if
              necessary, unilaterally, declaring our belief that the forces the Soviets were
              attempting to repress were uncontrollable in the long run and that it was to their own
              advantage and that of world peace to agree without delay on a reasonable solution of
              the German problem. We could state that the situation posed such a threat to world
              peace that the United States regarded it with the utmost gravity. We could then
              present a general plan for a definitive settlement of the German question, giving
              sufficient detail to demonstrate the seriousness of our intentions. Our plan should of
              course make provision not only for German reunification but also for a workable system
              of European security. This would include the problem of eventual disposition of
              foreign military forces in Germany. Our approach should be calculated to impress on
              the Soviets the depth of our concern and our anxiety to negotiate a reasonable
              solution which would take into account the legitimate interests of all parties
              concerned.</p>
            <p>27. The United States would naturally wish to avoid a situation in which it had
              offered to negotiate with the Soviets and the Soviets accepted, using the negotiations
              as a cover for continued brutal repression of the revolt only to break them off when
              their repressive measures had been successful. In order to prevent this we could
              inform the Soviets, after presenting the outline Western plan for settlement of the
              German question, that their forces would have to be withdrawn to their bases within
              Eastern Germany as a prerequisite to the commencement of further negotiations. We
              could at the same time assure the Soviets that if this condition were met, we would
              bring our influence to bear to cause the insurgents to cease measures of violence. If
              the Soviets refused to disengage their forces we could: <list>
                <label>a.</label>
                <item>Commence negotiations, publicly stating we were doing so to show Western
                  sincerity and willingness to come to an agreement. Break off the negotiations and
                  resort to other tactics if the course of the negotiations shows that the Soviets
                  are not serious in their intention to negotiate and are using the negotiations as
                  a cover for continued repression.</item>
                <label>b.</label>
                <item>Commence negotiations, setting a public time limit, either for reaching full
                  agreement in principle or for Soviet withdrawal to their bases in Germany.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>28. It is possible that categorical Western refusal to open formal negotiations prior
              to Soviet military disengagement, accompanied by wide publicity for the initial
              Western approach for settlement and the utilization of various other forms of Western
              pressure, some of which are described below, could possibly bring about Soviet
              disengagement. <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0623"/>This might also be true for a
              tactic in which the West actually commenced formal negotiations while simultaneously
              bringing to bear all available pressure from the outset of the negotiations. However,
              the equally likely result of these courses would be a Soviet conclusion that the
              original Western offer to negotiate was not intended seriously but rather as an
              attempt to profit from the unfavorable position in which the Soviets found
              themselves.</p>
            <p>29. In negotiations with the Soviets which might ensue as a result of a Western
              approach to them, our objectives should in any case be the following: <list>
                <label>a.</label>
                <item>To implement, if possible, the long-term primary objective of bringing about
                  the eventual complete withdrawal of Soviet forces from East Germany and the
                  reunification of Germany in freedom.</item>
                <label>b.</label>
                <item>To stop the further shedding of blood and bring about cessation of
                  violence.</item>
                <label>c.</label>
                <item>To secure the disengagement of the Soviet forces from the fighting and their
                  return to their barracks areas.</item>
                <label>d.</label>
                <item>To ensure against Communist reprisals against those individuals who had
                  participated in the uprising.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>30. Our initial approach to the Soviets would probably best be made quietly and
              without publicity. Should the Soviets show any disposition to enter into serious
              negotiations it would be wise to continue to avoid publicity with regard to the
              content of the Western proposal, so long as this content remains confidential and
              public speculation at the time is not injurious to U.S. interests. If, on the other
              hand, they were to respond negatively to our confidential approach, we should take
              steps at that point to publicize fully in the United Nations and elsewhere our
              willingness to negotiate and the general character of the proposals we have made to
              the Soviets. Our objective at this time should be to obtain the widest possible
              support throughout the world for our proposals and for the course of action we are
              following and to bring maximum pressure of public opinion to bear against the
              Soviets.</p>
            <p>31. As to the character of our specific proposals to be made to the Soviets, it is
              important that they should be designed to create the clear impression that we are
              prepared to negotiate with the Soviets on a basis which would leave open to them some
              course of action other than bloody repression of the East German revolt and which
              would also take their legitimate security interests into account. In other words, it
              is essential that we leave no doubt that a real and genuine alternative has been
              offered to the Soviets.</p>
            <p>32. In the interest of reinforcing this impression we could take certain additional
              actions such as the following: <list>
                <label>a.</label>
                <item>Use our own troops, after consultation with the British and French and the
                  Federal Republic, to seal off the Zonal Border to eastbound <pb n="596"
                    xml:id="pg_596" facs="0624"/>traffic (except for legitimately authorized traffic
                  to Berlin). This measure would emphasize our desire to prevent any flow into the
                  Zone from the West of arms for the insurgents or of individuals seeking to join in
                  the fighting on their side. On the other hand, such a measure, unless accompanied
                  with more positive actions, could well arouse resentment among Germans on both
                  sides of the Zonal Border for our actions in preventing offered assistance from
                  reaching the insurgents. In any event, it would be politically unthinkable to try
                  to seal the Border to westbound refugee traffic from the Zone into the Federal
                  Republic.</item>
                <label>b.</label>
                <item>After ascertaining whether there is adequate backing for such steps, initiate
                  immediate consultations to determine whether it would be feasible to seek action
                  in the General Assembly calling for the stationing of UN observers along the Zonal
                  Border, and possibly also along recognized land access routes to Berlin.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">C. UN Action.</hi></p>
            <p>33. Probably the most effective utilization which could be made of the United Nations
              would be to secure its authority and prestige in support of the position adopted by
              the three Western Powers and the Federal Republic. Though the UN Secretary General
              might conceivably play a useful role as an intermediary, the UN would offer
              disadvantages as a device for actually negotiating with the Soviets because of the
              diminution of U.S. and Western control over the course of the negotiations. Presuming
              that action in the Security Council would be blocked by the Soviet veto, it should be
              possible to secure General Assembly passage of a resolution calling on the USSR and
              the three Western Powers to negotiate on the German question. If a Western initiative
              to the Soviets for such negotiations had already been undertaken in confidence the
              resolution could call on the Soviets to withdraw their forces to their bases in the
              Zone within a short, fixed period—two or three days—in order to permit the
              commencement of negotiations at the end of that period.</p>
            <p>34. In the event the Soviets refused to negotiate or negotiations failed, the U.S.
              could then take steps to secure adoption of a General Assembly resolution endorsing
              the Western negotiating position, and thus place added pressure on the Soviets to
              accept it in the course of time.</p>
            <p>35. In the event of Soviet refusal to negotiate, or the breakdown of negotiations if
              held, or in the alternative event that the U.S. itself decided to apply measures of
              direct pressure on the Soviets (these are described in d. below) rather than to
              attempt to negotiate, the UN General Assembly could also be called on for other types
              of support. Among the possibilities open in this case are the following measures,
              intended as illustrative suggestions, which could be taken by the UN:</p>
            <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0625"/>
            <list>
              <label>a.</label>
              <item>Station UN observers in Berlin with or without Soviet permission (if there were
                still access by air to the city) and along the Zonal Border.</item>
              <label>b.</label>
              <item>Pass resolutions of censure, adopt sanctions against the USSR and support
                embargoes or boycotts against it.</item>
              <label>c.</label>
              <item>Call on all non-Communist countries which had Soviet Zone consular, trade, or
                other missions to expel them, thus giving a concrete expression to worldwide
                repudiation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime as
                “unrecognizable.”</item>
              <label>d.</label>
              <item>Establish a special UN Police Force to intervene in East Germany against Soviet
                repression of the revolt. It would be impossible to get the necessary two-thirds
                majority for this proposal in the face of Soviet opposition for this would amount to
                a UN declaration of war if not against the Soviet Union at least against Soviet
                forces in Germany. The proposal would have value only if the USSR agreed to the
                stationing of UN forces in the Zone either during negotiations or in order to
                implement any agreement reached in negotiations. However, it could also be
                considered as a possible course if there were a general revolt in the satellites
                including Eastern Germany, particularly if the Soviets were having a hard time
                repressing the revolt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>36. Be prepared to meet and deal with Soviet efforts to block UN action of any kind
              on the ground that Article 107 of the UN Charter gives the USSR authority to take
              whatever action it sees fit with regard to Germany as a former enemy nation. Past
              experience in the UN with questions involving both Germany and Austria (UN
              consideration of the Berlin Blockade in 1948; establishment of a UN commission on the
              question of free elections in both parts of Germany in 1951; and UN consideration in
              1952 of the failure of the Four Powers to agree on an Austrian Peace Treaty—in all
              three cases action was taken in the face of Soviet opposition based on Article 107)
              indicates that the UN could probably cope with this difficulty.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">D. Use of Direct American Pressure on the
                Soviets.</hi></p>
            <p>37. The U.S. could decide, on the basis of the situation at the time, that direct
              pressure was preferable to negotiation as a method of inducing the Soviets to withdraw
              from the Zone, or a useful supplement to negotiations. However, the use of the type of
              direct American pressure described below simultaneously with the commencement of
              negotiations might, given the strain the Soviet leaders would be under if a revolt
              occurred, increase Soviet suspicions of the American negotiating approach. This of
              course does not preclude the use of pressure as a negotiating tactic if the subsequent
              course of negotiations should justify it, nor does it preclude the use of indirect
              pressure through the UN at any stage. It is possible that heavy American pressure
              prior to a diplomatic approach of the type described above would assist in inducing
              Soviet willingness to negotiate seriously, particularly if the Soviets were having
              considerable difficulty <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0626"/>in maintaining
              control in the Zone, since they would scarcely evacuate the Zone in any case without
              asking for face-saving negotiations. The defect of a tactic of applying pressure as a
              preparatory measure for an offer to negotiate is that it increases the risk that
              Soviet leaders might be driven to desperate actions.</p>

                    instrumental in setting up in the very center of the Soviet Zone a visible and

              kept in mind. The presence of large numbers of Soviet troops (22 ground force

              uprising in East Germany and the 1956 revolt in Hungary, the increased security
              measures taken by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime, and the repeated
              admonitions of the West German Government and all major organizations in the Federal
              Republic to the East Zone population to remain quiet and refrain from violence combine
              to make unlikely under present circumstances any open revolt in East Germany, although

            <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Impact of Developments in Hungary and Poland.</hi> As a result
              of events in Poland and Hungary in late 1956 the Soviets and their puppet East German
              regime took steps to tighten their military control over the Soviet Zone of Germany
              and to eradicate, so far as possible, opposition among the population. Soviet forces
              were put on an alert basis, and efforts were made to increase the effectiveness of the
              East German armed forces and the armed workers’ militia (<hi rend="italic"
                >Kampfgruppen</hi>) established for the suppression of civil disturbances. The
              Soviet and East German leaders proclaimed their intention of putting down any popular
              uprising in Eastern Germany with armed force. The East German Communist regime further
              discredited itself in the eyes of the population by its slavish support of the
              upside-down Soviet version of the events in Hungary. Existing unrest and evidences of
              satisfaction [<hi rend="italic">dissatisfaction</hi>] among the students and
              intellectuals of the Zone were greatly intensified by events in Hungary and Poland.
              There was continued evidence of dissatisfaction with the regime among German workers
              because of long hours, low wages, high prices, continued rationing and shortage of
              consumer goods. The East German regime has reacted sharply in its efforts to keep the
              situation under control. For example, it expelled a number of “heretical” students and
              professors from East Zone universities, and in early March of this year gave a 10-year
              prison sentence to Wolfgang Harich, a young East German professor known to have
              written in favor of “national communism”.</p>

                Youth to West.</hi> In an effort to reduce the “contaminating” effect of Western
              influences on the youth of the Soviet Zone, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
              regime has recently imposed a series of restrictions designed to prevent East German
              university and high-school students from traveling to the Federal Republic and West
                Berlin.<note n="6" xml:id="d235fn6">Documentation on the ban on student travel is in
                Department of State, Central File 762.0221.</note> In recent years travel of these
              groups to the West for recreational purposes has become increasingly heavy,
              particularly during summer months. While the effectiveness of these new restrictions
              has not yet been fully tested, reports from Germany estimate that the driving force
              behind the young peoples’ desire to visit the West is so strong that they will
              probably display considerable ingenuity in finding means to circumvent the travel
              ban.</p>
            <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Economic Difficulties in the Zone.</hi> The East Zone regime has
              had to announce the abandonment of its economic goals for 1957 and the downward
              revision of the goals in its current five-year plan, which was adopted only in 1956.
              The regime’s chronic shortages of coal, <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0631"/>coke,
              iron ore, and non-ferrous metals, large supplies of which must be imported from
              undependable Soviet Bloc sources, have caused power shortages and shut-downs in many
              areas. Agricultural production continues to lag owing to labor shortages and
              inefficient organization. These various deficiencies have tended to make the East Zone
              more dependent on the Federal Republic and thereby increase its vulnerability to any
              Western economic countermeasures which it might be possible to put into effect.</p>
            <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Difficulties for the German Evangelical Church.</hi> The East
              Zone regime has stepped up its attack on the Evangelical Church. The formal pretext
              was the approval in March, 1957 by the governing body of the Church, which has
              authority in religious matters in both East and West Germany, of an agreement with the
              West German Defense Ministry concerning the provision and status of chaplains in the
              West German armed forces. Among the results of the present anti-Church campaign, which
              has extended to the Catholic Church as well, have been steps to make West German
              financial support of church activities in the Soviet Zone more difficult by insisting
              on the official exchange rate for transfers of funds, creation of a State Secretariat
              of Church Affairs in the East Zone Government to supervise religious activities in
              Eastern Germany, and the recommencement of the drive to substitute a formal pledge of
              allegiance to the principles of Communism for religious confirmation of the young.
              There have been indications that the regime may be contemplating the establishment of
              a separate, centrally controlled East German church in order to destroy the last
              important institutional link between East and West Germany. These developments
              indicate a realization on the part of the Soviet Zone regime that the Church is the
              principal organized center of intellectual resistance and opposition to Communist
              doctrine.</p>

            <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>Soviet control over East Germany has added to the power disequilibrium in Europe
                and thus to the threat to the security of the United States. Moreover, the continued
                division of Germany creates a serious element of instability in Europe which must be
                eliminated before a reliable and enduring basis for European security can be
                established.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>At the present time all evidence points to the conclusion that the Soviet Union
                has no intention of abandoning its position in East Germany, or of seriously
                negotiating on the subject of German reunification. It continues to maintain
                substantial military forces in the area, while representing minor withdrawals as a
                significant reduction.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>East Germany poses special and difficult problems of control for the USSR. While
                the East German regime has made limited progress in furthering its program, the East
                Germans are unlikely to accept of their own free will the Communist system which has
                been imposed upon them. A basic hope that reunification will somehow <pb n="607"
                  xml:id="pg_607" facs="0635"/>eventually be accomplished continues to be the main
                psychological support for the majority of East Germans in their disaffection with
                the Communist regime. The fact that the main body of the German nation in the
                Federal Republic has made remarkable advances in political freedom and economic
                well-being, together with the role played by West Berlin in providing a means of
                contact with the Free World, also serves to keep alive in East Germany the hope for
                an ultimate escape from Soviet domination. The situation in East Germany provides a
                showcase example of Soviet colonialism and furnishes opportunities for the West to
                exploit strong popular anti-Communist sentiments. Recently there have been numerous
                indications of unrest and uncertainty in the lower echelons of the East German
                Socialist Unity Party as a result of the repudiation of Stalin.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>However, as long as Germany remains divided, various factors at work in East
                Germany will operate to weaken the resistance of the population to the regime. These
                factors include the wholesale Communist indoctrination of youth, the weakening under
                unrelenting police-state pressure of resistance groups now in existence, and the
                continuing flight to the West of anti-regime refugees.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>It is in the national security interests of the United States to oppose Soviet
                control of East Germany and to seek the elimination of that control by means of the
                reunification of Germany in freedom. However, the United States is not prepared to
                resort to war to eliminate Soviet domination of East Germany, nor does attainment of
                this goal through internal revolutionary means appear likely so long as substantial
                Soviet forces are deployed in the area. Thus a basic change in Soviet policy toward
                Germany will be required before a German unification compatible with U.S. security
                interests can be attained. Until this change occurs, the possibilities for U.S.
                action vis-à-vis East Germany will remain limited.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>The process by which a change in Soviet policy toward Germany may occur may be a
                very complicated one since it is closely related to many other elements in the total
                relationship between the Soviet Union and the West. However, in respect to Germany
                one essential line of action is the continued focusing of world opinion on the
                injustice of a Germany forcibly divided by the imposition of a Soviet-dominated
                puppet regime. Another essential line of action is the attempt to make more
                difficult Soviet control in East Germany, and to encourage the development of forces
                there tending to strengthen resistance to the Communist regime. Moreover, there may
                be developments, such as the riots of 1953, which offer opportunities for
                exploitation. Such pressures upon the Soviet Union may lead it ultimately to accept
                the reunification of Germany in freedom as one of the prerequisites for the
                relaxation of international tension and as <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0636"
                />indispensable to the creation of stable and permanent European security.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>It is essential to this end that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                countries and, to the extent possible, non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                countries, demonstrate their support for reunification on a continuing basis. The
                United States will have to contend against the possible interest of certain
                uncommitted nations in trade connections with East Germany and combat the tendency
                of some Western European elements to favor political arrangements with the USSR
                based on a divided Germany.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>The maintenance by the free world of contact with East Germans is an important
                element in the stimulation of their resistance to Communism, confidence in the West,
                and hope for a reunified democratic and independent Germany. Imaginative and
                flexible programs will be required, permitting quick adjustment to possible changes
                in Communist restrictions on the access of the East German population to Berlin and
                West Germany.</item>

              positive asset to the United States and its Allies. It should be pursued, however,
              slowly and carefully, in order to insure that Yugoslavia’s forces will not be allowed
              to become a liability through growing neutralist tendencies. The coordination of
              Yugoslav and Western defense planning cannot be delayed pending an Italo-Yugoslav
              rapprochement.</p>
            <p>You may recall that representatives of the Departments of State and Defense reached
              general agreement on the advisability of a low-level approach to the question of
              improvement in Italo-Yugoslav relations at the informal meeting held on 21 October
              1954 in which Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName> and Ambassador
                <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> participated.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d238fn4">The record of this meeting is not printed.</note> Paragraph 7 of
              the attached <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum is to be read in the light
              of this general understanding. The specific steps envisaged for <gloss
                target="#t_CINCSOUTH1">CINCSOUTH</gloss> constitute an approach on the military
              level which would support, in time, diplomatic or political moves to further
              Italo-Yugoslav military cooperation.</p>
            <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0640"/>
            <p>Italian officers in the integrated international staff of Commander in Chief, Allied
              Forces Southern Europe, are representatives of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
              and not of the Italian national military establishment. In view of this relationship,
              you will appreciate that it is within the role of <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1"
                >CINCSOUTH</gloss>, once he is authorized by appropriate <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> agencies to conduct planning discussions with the Yugoslavs, to foster
              good will, informally at first, between Italian officers on his staff and Yugoslav
              military officers; and then to judge the timing of the follow-up for encouraging
              cooperation through bringing them together in military planning discussions.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense is convinced that all future discussions on U.S. Mutual
              Defense Assistance for Yugoslavia should be undertaken on a bilateral U.S.-Yugoslav
              basis. The resumption of the Tripartite-Yugoslav military talks of 1953<note n="5"
                xml:id="d238fn5">The talks were held in Washington August 24–28, 1953.</note> would
              be pointed inevitably toward increasing <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> for
              Yugoslavia. In the light of the unfavorable balance between world-wide military
              assistance commitments and budgetary limitations, it would be unwise to give the
              impression at this time that an increase in <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> for
              Yugoslavia is possible.</p>
            <p>As you know, the extent of military assistance to non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> countries in other strategic areas is determined on various criteria,
              including an assessment of how much initiative the respective countries show in
              military cooperation with their neighbors in the general interest of regional defense.
              The general objective of military assistance for Yugoslavia is to serve the security
              interests both of the U.S. and of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> member
              nations (a) by assisting Yugoslavia to remain free of Soviet domination, and (b) by
              militarily orienting Yugoslavia to the West.</p>
            <p>The purpose of any further military assistance discussion with Yugoslavia would be to
              reorient the present <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> to meet such Yugoslav
              requirements for regional defense as can be realistically determined from the prior
              coordination of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Yugoslav defense plans.
              Consequently, such coordination will not lead necessarily to increasing military aid
              to Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>You will agree, I am sure, that the steps which the Department of State and Defense
              have taken jointly during recent weeks to promote informal liaison between <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Yugoslav military authorities are in consonance
              with the above. The Department of Defense will continue to cooperate with the
              Department of State in this program in any way that we can be of effective
              assistance.</p>

                  of Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit
                  herein their comments and recommendations concerning the programs proposed by the
                  Department of State to strengthen Yugoslav military ties to the West.</item>
                <label>3.</label>
                <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that early and effective action should be
                  taken to strengthen Yugoslav military ties to the West in order to insure that
                  Yugoslavia’s considerable military potential will be a positive asset to the
                  United States and its Allies. The recent Trieste settlement should facilitate such
                  action by the West. The immediate needs in this respect are to coordinate <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Yugoslav defense plans and to determine the
                  type and magnitude of operational support which Western military forces will
                  furnish in event of an attack against Yugoslavia.</item>
                <label>4.</label>
                <item>In view of recent Yugoslav declarations to the effect that Yugoslavia does not
                  currently desire a formal military relationship with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                    >NATO</gloss>, the development of such a relationship should await a more
                  favorable political climate. In the meantime, the most desirable arrangement for
                  the purpose of coordinating <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Yugoslav
                  defense plans and discussing operational support for Yugoslavia is for <gloss

                  appropriate Yugoslav military authorities through <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1"
                    >CINCSOUTH</gloss>. The political actions as proposed by the Department of
                  State, including the provision of the <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0642"
                  />necessary authority for <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> should precede

                <item><gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1">CINCSOUTH</gloss> is considered to be the
                  appropriate commander to coordinate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                  Yugoslav defense plans inasmuch as he is responsible for planning <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military operations in areas adjacent to
                  Yugoslavia and is likely to command the bulk of Western military forces available
                  to assist Yugoslavia. Further, <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1">CINCSOUTH</gloss> is
                  likely to have a key role in any formal <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss>-Yugoslav military relationship which may eventuate.</item>
                <label>6.</label>
                <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that a <gloss

                  Italy and the Balkan Pact Powers, as proposed by the Department of State would be
                  less desirable than a <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1">CINCSOUTH</gloss> approach
                  directly to the Yugoslavs. <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1">CINCSOUTH</gloss> has
                  already been delegated the responsibility of insuring that <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Balkan Pact planning are in consonance and
                  the current problem is one of coordinating <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                  and Yugoslav defense plans, the need for which the Yugoslavs agreed to, in
                  principle, during the Tripartite-Yugoslav military conversations in August
                  1953.</item>
                <label>7.</label>
                <item>Although improvement of Italo-Yugoslav relations is an important aspect of the
                  over-all problem of strengthening Yugoslav military ties to the West, the
                  coordination of defense plans should not be unnecessarily delayed until such
                  improvement is achieved. If necessary, <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1"
                    >CINCSOUTH</gloss>, in his capacity as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                  commander, should conduct the early phases of the planning discussions without
                  bringing the Italians and Yugoslavs together. In the meantime, he should proceed
                  with the necessary steps to bring about improved relations between the two in
                  order that the Italians on his staff might participate directly when it becomes
                  necessary for them to do so. The views of <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1"
                    >CINCSOUTH</gloss> and the Department of State in this respect appear to be
                  sound. However, the specific steps required to further Italo-Yugoslav military
                  cooperation and the timing thereof should be left to the judgment of <gloss
                    target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCSOUTH1"
                    >CINCSOUTH</gloss> insofar as possible.</item>
                <label>8.</label>
                <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that further Tripartite-Yugoslav
                  military assistance discussions are no longer necessary from the U.S. military
                  viewpoint. The United States should undertake military assistance discussions with
                  the Yugoslavs on a bilateral basis as soon as possible after <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Yugoslav defense plans have been coordinated
                  sufficiently to determine realistic Yugoslav military force requirements. The
                  purpose of further military assistance discussions should be to develop a
                  U.S.-Yugoslav understanding as to the general order of magnitude and time-phasing
                  of future U.S. military assistance.</item>

                <label>9.</label>
                <item>It is the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the initial bilateral
                  military assistance discussions with the Yugoslavs following defense planning
                  talks should be the responsibility of <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1"
                    >USCINCEUR</gloss>. Although it is desirable for the Yugoslavs to take up all
                  military assistance matters through the American Military Assistance Staff,
                  Yugoslavia (<gloss target="#t_AMAY1">AMAY</gloss>), it is considered that <gloss

                  discussions relative to the general magnitude and time-phasing of future U.S.
                  military assistance. An understanding should be reached with the Yugoslavs,
                  however, that subsequent to these initial high-level discussions, they will have

              <item>To avoid repetition as to what I said in my recent conversations, in every case
                I described in plain terms U.S. reaction to a number of recent developments in
                Yugoslavia utilizing to the full the four points A to D inclusive of paragraph 5 of
                the briefing paper. I was particularly sharp respecting the Yugoslav accusations
                against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, was more than a little sarcastic on
                the subject of the timing of the re-establishment of Yugoslav relations with Red
                China (particularly as Yugoslav officials never fail to demand our understanding on
                matters which have a deep emotional appeal) and underlined our special and untiring
                efforts to help surmount what could have been a disastrous wheat deficit. Nor did I
                fail to remind the Yugoslavs how much their cherished independence was buttressed by
                U.S. assistance, the growing strength of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the
                recovery of Western Europe following the Marshall Plan and the sacrifices which the
                U.S. had made to re-establish its military power. All these efforts were the true
                support of Yugoslavia’s policy of independence, and the Soviet pressure on
                Yugoslavia had been eased when it was perfectly plain that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss> was gaining strength. In these circumstances, I found it somewhat
                contradictory that Yugoslav leaders should accuse <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss> of being purely anti-communist when its only purpose was <pb n="617"
                  xml:id="pg_617" facs="0645"/>to resist Soviet aggression. I also ticked off rather
                tartly the vague accusations about foreign interference in internal Yugoslav
                affairs, contrasting such innuendoes with the facts on aid. In conclusion, I
                indicated that a greater Yugoslav understanding of U.S. attitudes would be welcome,
                and it should not be forgotten that in the end it was the public sentiment in the
                U.S. that enabled our government to effect such rescue operations as we had done
                this fiscal year on the wheat crisis.</item>

              <item>In the reply I received from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VDJ1">Vilfan</persName>,
                he took the offensive respecting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, although not
                contesting the other points. As he is so close to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName>, I repeat his argumentation in some detail. When I criticized the
                anti-bloc utterances that now seem to be a commonplace of Yugoslav foreign policy
                statements, he defended the Yugoslav attitude by contending that unfortunately in
                the U.S. a strong anti-communist coloration had been given to <gloss
                  target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said this was evident from many speeches, both
                by governmental leaders and influential private persons. He said that in certain
                segments of the Republican Party everything was condemned if it was even related to
                Communist creed, and in this general condemnation Yugoslavia seemed to be included.
                Yugoslavia, he said, was a Communist country, but it was not a satellite and was
                determined to maintain its independence and had made great sacrifices to that end.
                He would be the first to recognize how much assistance the U.S. had given
                Yugoslavia, but nonetheless there was a growing impression that in U.S. opinion
                  <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was primarily an anti-communist instrument.
                I replied that perhaps in the public use of the word “communism” this expression had
                been loosely used to denote Soviet policy, but certainly the U.S. Government had
                drawn a distinction between Soviet aggressive communism and the Yugoslav
                interpretation. And the U.S. public had certainly accepted the principle of support
                for Yugoslavia, whatever its feelings might be about some aspects of the Yugoslav
                system. There could be no better illustration that non-interference in the internal
                affairs of other countries is integral to our policy, because it is integral to the
                way we construe our self-interest, which requires that other countries be free of
                any foreign domination, including our own. I said it was palpably unfair to lump
                  <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> together with the Soviet bloc as equally
                guilty of causing tensions. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VDJ1">Vilfan</persName> did
                not argue it further and turned to other matters.</item>

              <item><p>My conversation with the Vice President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                    >Kardelj</persName>, was more extensive. When I had finished my observations,
                    <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> immediately said that
                  U.S.-Yugoslav cooperation was on a sound basis and was developing well. He
                  specifically said that the Yugoslav Government had no complaint whatsoever against
                  the U.S. Government in the <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> affair. He had been most careful in his
                  speeches and press conferences to avoid giving any implication that he <pb n="618"
                    xml:id="pg_618" facs="0646"/>thought U.S. Government was involved. If <persName
                    corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> had so implied, it had not been as a result of
                  a governmental decision. What <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> had
                  meant was that certain press circles and other circles outside of Yugoslavia had
                  taken advantage of the <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> affair to interfere in internal Yugoslav
                  matters and this interference could be called an organized campaign by certain
                  circles to give support to <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName>. However <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                    >Kardelj</persName> had been most careful not to imply that any Western country
                  had given governmental support to <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                    >Dedijer</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName>. In fact, what
                  had happened was that <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> had offered their services and this had been
                  taken up by various circles abroad.</p>
                <p>In assessing the whole <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> affair, <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                    >Kardelj</persName> continued, it must not be forgotten that for some years
                  Yugoslavia lived under great Soviet pressure. It was the positive policy of the
                  Soviet Union to interfere in internal Yugoslav matters and violent propaganda
                  efforts had been undertaken to this end. Socialism is not yet well enough
                  established in Yugoslavia for the government to regard such campaigns with
                  equanimity. On top of this, there is the hope in many circles abroad that
                  Yugoslavia will abandon its present course and revert to what we could both call a
                  Western democracy type of government. Because of the economic situation in the
                  country this was not feasible until more socialist gains were consolidated. Any
                  other policy would throw Yugoslavia into confusion and internal convulsions.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> said that his impression had been
                  that the Governments of the US, UK and France had a good understanding of the
                  fundamental postulates of Yugoslav foreign policy. Unfortunately, some other
                  governments had read into “normalization” an interpretation which was not
                  warranted by the facts. Normalization had been an asset and a benefit to
                  Yugoslavia in relieving the political pressure so long applied by the Soviet
                  Union. But normalization had not affected the basic tenets of Yugoslav foreign
                  policy. Unfortunately, the <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName> affair had been so treated in the press as
                  to create the impression that these two personalities were champions of a
                  pro-Western policy and while the Yugoslav Government was veering towards a
                  pro-Soviet policy. What amounted to a newspaper campaign to this effect had gotten
                  underway and nothing could be more contrary to the truth. In fact, commented
                    <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>, the only beneficiary from the
                  press campaign on <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> had been the Soviet Union. <persName
                    corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName> was a figure of no political importance
                  while <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> had occupied high positions in
                  the government. But the whole experience which he and his colleagues had had in
                  dealing with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> was that of a confused
                  and vacillating character. <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> recalled
                  that during the difficult Trieste negotiations he and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                    >Tito</persName> had frequently had to edit <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                    >Djilas</persName>’ speeches because their tone was so extreme that they could
                  have seriously compromised the objective we were all <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619"
                    facs="0647"/>seeking of a reasonable Trieste settlement. <persName
                    corresp="#p_DM1">Djilas</persName> had always been a vacillating character
                  swinging from extreme to extreme and his attempts to represent himself as the
                  champion of a pro-Western policy had in effect tended to misrepresent the real
                  aims of Yugoslav foreign policy.</p>
                <p>We also had occasion to discuss briefly the recent developments in the USSR.
                    <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> thought that the ouster of
                    <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d239fn6"
                      ><persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Georgiy M. Malenkov</persName>, Chairman of the

                  was evidence that the Yugoslav Government’s interpretation of the flow of events
                  in the Soviet Union had been the correct one. There were great stresses and
                  strains in the USSR and enormous problems to be solved. The Western world must
                  expect a number of ups and downs in Soviet developments and should not be thrown
                  off balance by tough talk and increased bellicosity. He thought the Western world
                  must do what it could to support the moderate elements in the Soviet government.
                  When I remarked that it was difficult to find out who they were even if any
                  support were advisable, <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> laughed and
                  admitted that the secrets of the Kremlin were not easy to penetrate and no one
                  could be sure who was supporting what. His own estimate was, in spite of the
                    <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                    >Bulganin</persName> speeches, that Soviet foreign policy would not undergo much
                  change although we would probably hear some more threatening words, particularly
                  with reference to China. In response to my question, he admitted that the
                    <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                    >Khrushchev</persName> affair was a setback but said we should not be
                  discouraged and that we must wait and see what the deeds of the USSR would be.
                  When I pointed out that the French Government had already made an attempt to test
                  the temperature as far as positive action was concerned, using the Austrian Treaty
                  as the instrument, <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> admitted that the
                  Soviet reaction had been entirely negative. He thought however that this was
                  probably influenced by the developments in China.</p>
                <p>When I pointed out the danger of relaxing our efforts to obtain ratification of
                  the Paris agreements,<note n="7" xml:id="d239fn7">Reference is to the Nine-Power
                    and Four-Power Agreements, signed October 23, 1954, which provided for the

                      >NATO</gloss>.</note><persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> immediately
                  said that he fully agreed. He said not to ratify the conventions would be a great
                  mistake as it would merely encourage those Soviet elements who argued for a tough
                  policy. At the same time, the West should be careful to keep the door open for
                  negotiations and if possible should make it plain that it was willing to negotiate
                  whenever there seemed to be some prospect of success. He was most firm, however,
                  in his insistence that the Paris Pacts should be ratified, a point of view that is
                  certainly not reflected in the Yugoslav press.</p></item>

              <item><p>With Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDA1">Bebler</persName>, I have had a number
                  of conversations since the turn of the year. He tends to stick closely to whatever
                  the official line may be at the moment, although on occasions he can be
                  surprisingly frank. One night at dinner, he sharply attacked the U.S. press in the
                    <persName corresp="#p_DV1">Dedijer</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                    >Djilas</persName> affair and after having told him that he, from his experience

                  a free press is like, how it operates, what is news, why it’s news and how silly
                  in general were some of the interpretations advanced. This conversation closed the
                  subject.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#p_BDA1">Bebler</persName>, however, is intensely interested
                  in the developments in the USSR and in our China policy. On the first, he misses
                  no opportunity to ask our estimate, which I have given him on the basis of our
                  information directives. While he follows the official line, particularly that the
                  Yugoslavs were originally right, I have the impression that he now harbors some
                  doubts respecting the reality of changes in the Soviet system. But this is only an
                  impression, and not substantiated by any specific remarks. On China, he is
                  constantly seeking an interpretation of the President’s and the Secretary’s
                  statements, probing to see if there is any hope of the U.S. accepting a cease-fire
                  on the basis of a withdrawal from all the offshore islands. I am not drawn, but he
                  does not abandon it. He repeats the standard expression that Formosa is part of
                  China, but takes prompt evasive action when I ask him if he would surrender
                  Formosa to Red China, with everything that such a surrender would
                imply.</p></item>

              <item>As the Foreign Secretary was extremely occupied after his return from the Far

                immediately said he thought our points were well taken and he had to agree that the
                U.S. had demonstrated a completely sympathetic understanding of Yugoslavia’s
                problems and policies. He said that the Yugoslav press did not always reflect
                accurately his Government’s viewpoint because the local press was being given more
                freedom of action, although he admitted it could not be compared to the American
                press in this respect. He said that while the Yugoslav Government was opposed to the
                division of the world into blocs for reasons which it thought were valid, this did
                not mean that it did not distinguish between the outlook and intent of the two great
                blocs. It had had bitter experiences with the Soviet bloc and was well aware of what
                it portended. The Yugoslav analysis of trends in the Soviet Union had been confirmed
                by recent events. He thought, as did <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>,
                that the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>–<persName
                  corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> affair was not encouraging, but the end was
                not yet. At best, it was a compromise and the stresses remained. He thought that in
                spite of sabre-rattling Soviet foreign policy would remain about the same. In the
                  <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0649"/>meantime Yugoslav relations with the
                Western powers would continue to develop.</item>
            </list>
            <p>On the Paris Pacts, he echoed <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>’s
              position.</p>
            <p>With respect to Red China, <persName corresp="#p_PK1">Koca Popovic</persName> was
              unusually frank. He thought both the President’s statements and the Secretary’s recent
              speech had gone very far in displaying a reasonable and conciliatory attitude. He said
              that given all the considerations involved, he could not see how our leaders could
              have come farther in showing American willingness to search for a peaceful solution.
              He was doubtful if a United Nations solution could be found at this time, but
              certainly the U.S. position was worthy of praise. As for Yugoslavia’s decision to
              re-establish relations with Red China, he said he agreed the timing was not good and
              that his personal opinion was it had been a mistake. It would perhaps have been wiser
              to wait, and he implied that the decision was the result of pressure, probably from
                <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>.<note n="9" xml:id="d239fn9"><persName

            <p>Returning to the question of U.S.-Yugoslav relations and in reply to my various
              points, the Foreign Secretary said he had only one real complaint, and that was about
              the American press. Admitting that the press situation in the two countries was
              different, could not I and Department do something to influence the reporting on
              Yugoslavia? It had become almost standard in the U.S. press to speak of Red Russia,
              Red China and Red Yugoslavia, as if they were all the same which (a) was not true and
              (b) inevitably aroused active resentment in Yugoslavia. He realized that was not an
              easy problem as he knew something about the American press. Nonetheless it did have
              its effect on our relations and the use of the label “communistic” (which was in such
              bad odor in the U.S.) seemed to put Yugoslavia in the same pot as the USSR and Red
              China. I said that communism certainly and understandably had a bad name at home, but
              I would do what I properly could to assist the U.S. correspondents in reporting fairly
              and objectively on Yugoslavia, which I thought they usually tried to do. Mr.
                <persName>Popovic</persName> said that his remarks did not in any way apply to the
              U.S. Government which he thought had drawn the necessary distinctions for a long
              time.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The replies to my sometimes acid observations were
              largely conciliatory, and tended to emphasize the satisfactory side of U.S.-Yugoslav
              relations and to complain more about the U.S. press than the Government. It is plain
              that the high Yugoslavs still want their bread buttered on both sides. Political
              support, economic help, military aid, growing strength of and good relations with the
              West remain of paramount importance. At the same time the anti-bloc talk (so long as
              it is not followed by any adverse action by the Western Powers) provides an easy way
              of exemplifying how Yugoslavia is <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0650"
              />“different”, is independent, and helps to justify unpopular internal policies which
              can be equated to those of such non-bloc powers as India and Burma. The reiterated
              insistence upon the similarity of prewar Yugoslavia to India, in that both were
              allegedly victims of foreign capitalistic exploitation, provides a convenient peg on
              which to hang the continuation of economic policies whose success is yet to be
              observed. The fact that India may have pursued an entirely different course in
              agriculture, for example, does not invalidate the usefulness of the argument
              internally. The justification for the regime, in a part of the world that has always
              known dictators, is to be found in its so-called socialistic program. Otherwise, why
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>? Why not some other dictator? This
              problem is fundamental to the Government and explains in some measure why it is often
              so reluctant to effect reforms whose necessity is privately admitted where they may
              run counter to Marxian doctrine. Therefore it is my estimate that the anti-bloc
              declarations will continue to be expounded, so long as some profit internally can be
              squeezed from them. What it may mean in practice, remains to be seen, particularly
              after the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>–<persName
                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> affair.</p>
            <p>It is clear from my conversations that the Yugoslav leaders are unhappy over
              developments in the USSR. They obviously had high hopes of fundamental changes which
              would lead to a general lessening of tension. Peace is essential to the present
              regime. Extremely vulnerable to attack, weak in the air, dependent upon a not too
              sympathetic West for survival, war presents innumerable hazards to the continuance of
              the regime. Their great hope is that an accommodation can some day be found which will
              enable Yugoslavia to continue its experiment in doubtful economics. Although those
              with whom I talked put up a bold front about having been right on Soviet developments,
              it is plain that they are unhappy and unsure of the future in Russia. The contrast
              between the former assurance of their statements with the present uncertainty, is most
              marked. It is likely therefore that with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
              >Tito</persName>’s return a new assessment is being made of Yugoslavia’s international
              position. I should say a convenient measure of the Yugoslav Government’s estimate of
              its position and its future intentions will come when we see how it proposes to deal
              with the question of further military cooperation with the West, a question now
              reposing with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> personally.</p>

              Yugoslavia’s present posture, taking into account the observations pulled together in
              the Department. Perhaps it is just as well to send this along now before the promised
              conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> on military ties with
              the West. In this way the Department can judge his reply in the light of our analysis
              and assessment of Yugoslav policy. We have tried to draw up a balance sheet in which
              all important items are set forth.</p>
            <p>I. Perhaps the best aid in trying to weigh the pros and cons of Yugoslavia’s present
              and future value to the West, is to enumerate and analyze them. “Present and future
              value to the West” is a general term. I choose it deliberately in preference to more
              seemingly precise formulations, such as “will Yugoslavia rejoin the <gloss
                target="#t_Cominform1">Cominform</gloss>”, “Would Yugoslavia in another World War
              try to play the role of World War II Sweden”, because important as these questions may
              be, they seem to me to contemplate only two among many and mostly unforseeable
              possible configurations of events. I have therefore tried to examine the relevant
              factors with a view to their present meaning and future portent, but have avoided
              prophesying about any specific hypothetical possibilities, which might or might not
              arise.</p>
            <p>II. The “pros” include the following: <list>
                <label>(1)</label>
                <item>The Yugoslav initiative to convert the Balkan entente into a military
                  alliance. This is a strong plus which is still with us, though there have been
                  later developments which may have reduced but have not wiped out its value. They
                  will be discussed under the heading of “cons”. The fact that the Yugoslav
                  initiative followed and may have been caused by the failure of the Berlin
                    Conference<note n="4" xml:id="d240fn4">Reference is to the Four-Power Foreign
                    Ministers meeting held in Berlin January–April 1954.</note> does not <pb n="624"
                    xml:id="pg_624" facs="0652"/>detract from its significance as a gain in the
                  strength of the West. Its weight as a plus was from the outset limited by the fact
                  that the Yugoslavs have always insisted on differentiating it from <gloss
                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, and even
                    <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, which they persist in regarding as
                  ideological blocs. Under this heading also comes the military implementation of
                  the alliance which the Greeks at least find satisfactory; and its broadening by
                  the Balkan Consultative Assembly in a way to which the Yugoslavs attach special
                  value. It is noteworthy also that in his March 7, 1955 speech,<note n="5"
                    xml:id="d240fn5">In a policy address to the Yugoslav Federal Assembly on March
                    7, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> discussed Yugoslavia’s
                    relationship with the Soviet Union and with the West. Highlights of the speech
                    were transmitted to the Department in telegram 732 from Belgrade, March 8
                    (Department of State, Central Files, 668.00/3–855) and an analysis of the speech
                    was transmitted in telegram 1532 from Moscow, March 12 (ibid, 661.68/3–1255).

                    >Tito</persName> went out of his way to correct any impression that Yugoslavia
                  was losing interest in the defensive importance of the alliance. For what they are
                  worth, certain indications that the Yugoslavs regard their commitments as
                  automatic in the event of an attack on Greece or Turkey, tend to enhance the value
                  of the alliance for the West.</item>
                <label>(2)</label>
                <item>The private assurances of Yugoslav leaders that they understand the need for
                  joint military planning with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, provided their
                  all-important requirements for finding a suitable form, which will preserve their
                  posture of absolute independence, can be met. This is a tentative plus, and
                  subject of course to what <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> finally
                  decides.</item>
                <label>(3)</label>
                <item>The Trieste settlement, the moderate and constructive way in which it was
                  presented to the Yugoslav public, and the moderation with which the Yugoslavs have
                  conducted themselves in the course of later developments. The most recent evidence
                  of this is <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s resigned acquiescence,
                  in his conversation with me on Brioni, in the increased Italian pressure on the
                  Slovene minority. It is true that their willingness to reach a settlement was
                  probably related to their desperate need for wheat at the time. But their
                  behaviour since seems to imply a genuine desire to establish good relations with
                  Italy.</item>
                <label>(4)</label>
                <item>The continued maintenance of their armed strength at a high level, despite the
                  heavy economic burden and despite their professed conviction that war is less
                  likely than before. This armed strength can have only one primary purpose, the
                  maintenance of Yugoslav independence against threats from the East, as certainly
                  they fear no threats from the West, including Italy.</item>
                <label>(5)</label>
                <item>The logic of historic Serbian and Yugoslav ambitions in the Balkans. The
                  desire to play “a leading role” involves (as the circumstance of the falling out
                  with Stalin demonstrates) a clash of interests with the USSR. If the new
                  leadership of the USSR were to make way <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0653"
                  />for Yugoslavia to achieve the influence it seeks among the satellites, which is
                  all but inconceivable, it would mean such a loss of Soviet power that the West
                  could contemplate without too much apprehension the complications that might
                  ensue. It is most improbable that any Yugoslav Government would forego these
                  ambitions, or could be bribed to forego them. In any case it is not to be excluded
                  that Yugoslavia’s powers of seduction of the satellites, in the pursuit of its
                  ambitions, may eventually serve the interests of the free world.</item>
                <label>(6)</label>
                <item>Yugoslavia’s determination to maintain its independence against all comers,
                  and to fight any attacker, which has been demonstrated by ample evidence. At best
                  it points to a Yugoslav readiness to support the West’s resistance to the Soviet
                  expansionist threat (the imminence of which Yugoslavia will judge for itself). At
                  worst it points to an armed neutrality, alone or in conjunction with
                  others.</item>
                <label>(7)</label>
                <item>Yugoslav public support of the Austrian solution sought by the West, which
                  would restore that country’s independence (with an indication that they may have
                  privately urged this upon the Soviets) in spite of the fact that an independent
                  Austria would be a neutralized and defenseless Austria through which Yugoslavia’s
                  Ljubljana flank could be turned.</item>

                  None of these things of course cost anything, that is, they have not involved any
                  commitments as yet. However, they involve the growth of relations in the economic
                  field in line with Yugoslavia’s increasing efforts to build up the relative
                  emphasis of the non-military over the military aspects of its relations with the
                  West; and they point toward the growth of economic ties that it will be in
                  Yugoslavia’s interest to maintain.</item>

                <item>The multiplicity of public and private assurances from Yugoslav leaders that
                  “normalization” does not mean any weakening of Yugoslavia’s ties with the West.
                  This has the ring of conviction in that it seems to be to Yugoslavia’s interest to
                  maintain such ties under almost any foreseeable circumstances provided the West
                  maintains its unity and strength.</item>
                <label>(10)</label>
                <item>The fact that the Yugoslav rationale, at least in part, for their welcoming of
                  normalization and the belief that the danger of war is less, seems to be turning
                  against them. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> in his December 21,
                  1954 speech before the Indian Parliament, spoke of “a change in the attitude of
                  the Soviet Union toward Yugoslavia” which he attributed not only to Stalin’s
                  death, but more to “the change in the fields of domestic and foreign policies
                  which the present leaders of the Soviet Union are carrying out”. This theme, which

                  coexistence” and their cultivation of neutralist powers such as India, do not mean
                  that they are moving toward a neutralist or “third force” position. This also has
                  the ring of conviction in that if they were it would mean a weakening of ties with

                  Their criticism may mean, rather than a drift toward neutralism, a desire to

              </list></p>
            <p>III. The “cons” include the following:</p>
            <p>(1) The apparent lessening of interest in the Balkan Military Alliance soon after it
              was signed, the failure to implement it either along the lines so clearly laid out by
              the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> example, or as much as might have been done
              in other ways, and the de-emphasis of its military features. Under this heading also
              comes the Yugoslav refusal to accept any commitment to Greece or Turkey if they are
              involved in war because of their <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> obligations,
              and its rejection to date of direct relations between the alliance and <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. To the extent that this non-cooperation may indicate
              an unwillingness to stand by the West in certain circumstances, its weight as a “con”
              is increased. To the extent that it may be intended to serve Yugoslavia’s special
              interests and ambitions in the Balkans which clash with Soviet interests, it may not
              be an unmitigated evil. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s harassment of
              Turkey because of the Turkish-Iraq Pact<note n="7" xml:id="d240fn7">Reference is to
                the Mutual Defense Treaty of February 24, 1955.</note> also weakens the Balkan
              Alliance.</p>
            <p>(2) Obvious Yugoslav hesitations about joint military planning with <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Whatever the decision may be, the Yugoslav
              Government has not eagerly or quickly embraced this opportunity to add to its
              security.</p>
            <p>(3) The fact that economic pressures played a considerable part in causing Yugoslavia
              to accept the Trieste settlement. It is possible that the settlement would not have
              been reached if the economic pressures on Yugoslavia and its desire for military aid
              had not been as great as they were. And it is also possible that Yugoslavia’s
              moderation since then may result in some measure from the continuing need to look to
              us for economic and military aid. If so the improvement of Italo-Yugoslav relations
              may rest on less firm foundations then we have hoped.</p>
            <p>[<hi rend="italic">Numbered paragraph 4 (7 lines of source text) not
                declassified</hi>]</p>
            <p>(5) The fact that Yugoslav ambitions in the Balkans clash in some measure with the
              interests of some of our allies and with our own interests in a single-minded
              concentration on the overriding Soviet menace. Under this heading comes the
              possibility of the Soviets being able in some way to take advantage of these ambitions
              (since they have it in their power to satisfy them) to the detriment of our
              interests.</p>
            <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0656"/>
            <p>(6) The Yugoslav belief (or rationalization) that the danger of war has receded, and
              that an equilibrium has been reached between the East and West which requires a
              de-emphasis of defense preparations, i.e., the policy of “active coexistence” and the
              criticism of the West based on opposition to “blocs”. While Yugoslavia does not
              slacken its own defense effort, non-cooperation renders it less effective, and its
              criticisms of Western policies tend less to correct their deficiencies than to give
              aid and comfort to our enemies. It is noteworthy in this connection that the regime
              permits press criticisms of the West that go far beyond any public statements by
              political figures. Under this heading also comes <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s trip to India and Burma and the encouragement he has given to
              neutralist sentiment, and to wishful thinking about the Soviet menace. In other words,
              by whatever name it is called, Yugoslavia is less than an ally, even if at present
              more than a neutral, and it is always possible that the private reassurances of its
              leaders to the West may not be genuinely meant.</p>
            <p>(7) The substantial nature of Yugoslavia’s economic ties with the West, and its
              refusal to enter into meaningful economic commitments.</p>
            <p>(8) The whole process of “normalization” and its implications which mar the unity of
              the West and could put Yugoslavia into a neutralist of third force position. There is
              also the possibility that private reassurances to the West about normalization may not
              be genuinely meant.</p>
            <p>(9) The Yugoslav belief (or rationalization) that the modification of Stalinism is
              due to internal pressures in the Soviet Union, and that it is an irreversible process.
              This may cause them to treat indications of a return to Stalinism as passing
              phenomena, and may detract from rather than increase their vigilance.</p>
            <p>(10) The regime’s obvious dread of war, especially atomic war and its consequent
              tendency, rather than drawing closer to the West, to disassociate themselves,
              especially in its public posture, from the West. As stated above, there is always the
              possibility that private reassurances to the West may not be genuine.</p>
            <p>(11) Yugoslavia’s frequent failure to cooperate with the U.S. in the U.N.</p>
            <p>(12) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s public lack of enthusiasm for the
              Western defense organization for which he has the least criticism, <gloss
                target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, and the fact that even in private he is more ready to
              accept the benefits of its ratification than to take any risks or undertake any
              obligations to further its purposes.</p>
            <p>(13) The need of a totalitarian regime for constant tension, for something or someone
              to fear or hate, in order to maintain its hold over the people. This is an uncertain
              factor, but if the USSR is determined to conciliate Yugoslavia and since the West
              cannot afford to <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0657"/>relax its defensive buildup,
              it looks, or current indications, as if the regime will continue to foster suspicion
              of the West’s intentions and inspire fear that it is the policies of the West that are
              increasing the risk of atomic war.</p>
            <p>(14) The possibility that, in spite of some indications of economic improvement, the
              regime will not be able to produce satisfactory economic results. This will reduce
              Yugoslavia’s ability to maintain its independence of the Soviets and will reduce the
              chances for a liberalization of the regime. While it would increase its need for
              Western economic aid, it seems on balance that the Soviets might be the greater
              gainers from a Yugoslavia which had made a failure of its own brand of Communism, and
              which was faced with the drastic alternatives that this would imply.</p>
            <p>(15) The pull of the old Communist tie, the ideological affinity between Yugoslavia
              and the USSR. While the regime is certainly wary lest the tie be in fact a noose, its
              pull must nevertheless be felt and coupled with accompanying suspicions of the West
              (e.g. the criticism of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as having evolved from an
              alliance for defense against Soviet aggression to an anti-Communist alliance to
              maintain the status quo in the West) and apparent fear that the policies of the West
              may lead to war, might cause the regime to play the Soviet game more than it is doing
              now. The fact that most of the Communist party are anti-Western sets a limit on how
              far <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> can swing to the West.</p>
            <p>IV. What is the net of all this?</p>
            <p>The criterion would seem to be how the regime judges its interests. Considering how
              the Soviets judge their interests, the more so since the fall of <persName
                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>, it is hard to understand how the regime could
              at this time jeopardize the protection which its ties with the West afford it. True it
              may and probably does feel that the West has no alternative but to maintain that
              protection. But this is not invariably true. There is a point of no return in the aid
              and comfort which Yugoslavia can afford to render the enemy, beyond which the West
              would feel it was contributing to the injury rather than the protection of its
              interests. To define this point is most difficult because the configuration in which
              it may occur is unforeseeable. It may be assumed that the Yugoslavs will take great
              care not to come dangerously close to it (a) as long as they need our economic or
              military aid and (b) as long as Soviet policies remain a threat to Yugoslav
              independence or the security of the regime. It would seem that as long as these two
              conditions are fulfilled, the Yugoslavs will do what they can, but not much more than
              they judge necessary, to constitute themselves a plus for the West, subject to one
              overriding possibility.</p>
            <p>The regime knows it can hardly expect to survive a general war. Theoretically it
              should take almost any risk therefore that promised <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630"
                facs="0658"/>to prevent or avoid war, including the loss of U.S. economic and
              military aid. It is easy to say that it would prefer the more distant danger of loss
              of independence to the Soviets, to the risk of destruction in a general war. But it is
              almost impossible to envisage how this could ever be a real choice, for it is
              impossible to conceive how it could suppose that anything it could do would enable
              Yugoslavia to escape a general war whichever side they were on, or however much they
              sought the role of a World War II Sweden. The leaders would, therefore, probably
              vacillate, and try for a middle course, which is just what they seem to be doing now.
              And on this theory it will be difficult for the U.S. to influence them directly.
              Economic pressure would have to be handled with all the subtlety that was used in the
              Trieste negotiations, or it might provide the regime with just the enemy it needs to
              enable it to carry out more drastic measures of control. To give in to obvious
              economic pressure would mean forfeiting the posture of independence which means
              everything emotionally and on which their hopes for a greater future depend. On the
              other hand, a withdrawal or diminution of U.S. aid, simply because of higher
              priorities, if it were done without recriminations or loss of face to the regime,
              might not provoke harmful reactions. Everything would probably depend on the
              circumstances and how it was done. If we should stop assistance, clearly the best
              thing we can do to keep the Yugoslavs steady is to convince them that our policies are
              not increasing the risk of general war. Everything we can do or say, short of taking
              unjustified defense risks, that puts us in a posture of moderation and reasonableness,
              will contribute to this end. To what extent this is a feasible U.S. policy cannot be
              judged from here.</p>
            <p>V. Should the U.S. revise its policy towards Yugoslavia?</p>

              <label>(1)</label>
              <item>It will be seen from the foregoing how closely balanced are the pros and cons of
                the balance sheet. Obviously a good case can be made for the present policy under
                the N.S.C. paper<note n="8" xml:id="d240fn8">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                    >NSC</gloss> 5406/1, “United States Policy Towards Yugoslavia,” February 6,

                    target="frus1952-54v08#pg_1377">1377</ref>.</note> and that with patience, aid
                and diplomacy, Yugoslavia can be bound more firmly to the West. This policy was also
                justified by the geographical and strategic considerations of the time it was
                devised. The strength of the Yugoslav ground forces, the removal of the USSR from
                the Adriatic and Italy, the psychological impact of the <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> heresy, the determination to be free from Moscow control, the
                addition of 400,000 men to potential Western strength, all these were important
                considerations from a military point of view. But doubts inevitably arise as the
                result of normalization, delay in military planning (both Balkan Alliance and
                liaison with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>), anti-bloc attacks,
                thinly-veiled accusations <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0659"/>against U.S.,
                etc. Therefore it is only natural that the U.S. should review its policy toward
                Yugoslavia and I believe now is the time to do it. We have tried to set forth above
                the various elements as we see them from Belgrade. There are other aspects which
                cannot be assessed from here but which are no doubt equally important.</item>
              <label>(2)</label>
              <item>How far has the development of new weapons, air power and naval-air power affect
                the value of Yugoslavia to the West? Do the Yugoslav ground forces (the country’s
                principal military strength) represent the same importance to us now as they did in
                1953? How important is the Adriatic Sea and eastern coast? These are some of the
                questions that occur to me and on which we are not informed. I gathered from
                conversations with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CAJH1">Cassady</persName><note
                  n="9" xml:id="d240fn9">No record of these conversations has been found in

                importance, but not being in a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country, I
                realize that our information on the military side is most scanty. And yet, are these
                not the very questions which will affect our policy decisions? In short, how
                important is Yugoslavia today to the West from the geographic, strategic and
                military point of view? Is it still essential, or can we well afford to risk a
                possibly neutral, if well-armed, Yugoslavia and modify our policies to take account
                of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s apparent desire to have the best
                of both worlds? This is a question that can only be answered in Washington in the
                light of the overall military posture of the West. I think we should review our
                Yugoslav policy with a realistic appraisal of what Yugoslavia represents in the
                general security interest of the U.S. I hope the foregoing will help if such a
                review is decided.</item>

              <item>This is a very long letter for which I apologize. But, in your own words, this
                is a “gray” area and singularly lacking in black and white colors on which one can
                so easily pass judgment. There are many imponderables and obscure shadings, and the
                best we can do is to make our best appraisal and see if a policy so conceived can
                receive the approval of Congress. I fully realize that more is involved than merely
                our opinion of what would be a justified risk. In the end Congress must approve if
                aid is to continue, and the Yugoslav government is not being helpful in this regard.
                Perhaps we shall have to get tougher in the hope they will become more amenable,
                even if nothing is basically changed. I shall then have a rather unpleasant time,
                but I am used to that. Trieste was no picnic here.</item>

            <p>1. Since, in major respects, the implementation of U.S. policy towards Yugoslavia was
              either held in abeyance or seriously curtailed by the existing impasse over Trieste,
              the focus of our efforts within the period under review was upon a solution of this
              problem. Diplomatic negotiations of eight months duration, in which the U.S. and the
              U.K. laboriously promoted an Italian-Yugoslav accord on Trieste, <pb n="633"
                xml:id="pg_633" facs="0661"/>culminated October 5, 1954 in a four-power
              understanding which resolved the issue in a manner not only acceptable to Italy and
              Yugoslavia but also favorable to U.S. interests. It is hoped that the disposal of the
              Trieste problem, in terms accepted by both Yugoslavia and Italy, established the basis
              for Italian-Yugoslav rapprochement and cleared the way for planning and action with
              respect to other phases of U.S. policy towards Yugoslavia. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines
                of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
            <p>2. On August 9, 1954, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey concluded a treaty for a military
              elaboration of the Balkan (Ankara) Pact. From the outset, the U.S. assumed a
              sympathetic: attitude toward the development of the Balkan Entente into a formal
              military alliance. Our influence was exerted in concert with the U.K. and France to
              the end that the conclusion of the Alliance should not impede the achievement of other
              important objectives of U.S. policy. Although the establishment of the Balkan Alliance
              provides no organic connection with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, it aligns
              Yugoslavia indirectly with the general scheme of Western defense.</p>
            <p>3. In continuation of U.S. military aid to Yugoslavia, the cumulative amount
              programmed from the beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951 through
              February 28, 1955 reached $787.7 million. During the period of April 30–January 31,
              1955 materials delivered increased from 47 to 65 percent of the total value of
              end-items programmed since <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951; dollar value of
              end-items delivered by January 31, 1955 was $513.1 million. Deliveries within the
              period amounted to $144.3 million.</p>
            <p>4. At the end of the period under review, the cumulative total of U.S. economic
              assistance which had been programmed and allotted for Yugoslavia since the beginning
              of the U.S. aid programs in 1950 amounted to $475.485 million. At the end of February
              1955, $435.6 million had been shipped. (These figures include surplus agricultural
              commodities provided under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480<note n="3"
                xml:id="d241fn3">Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L.
                480), approved July 10, 1954; 68 Stat. 454.</note> as outlined in paragraph 5.) The
              cumulative total of contributions by the U.K. and France to the tripartite economic
              aid program for Yugoslavia reached the equivalent of $77 million ($48.2 million from
              the U.K. and $28.8 million from France). During this period a final allotment of $10
              million was made under the Mutual Security Program for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                >FY</gloss> 1954, which totalled $65 million. The <gloss target="#t_MSP1"

              1955 is $45 million plus $500,000 for technical exchange activities. Allotments for

              <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 funds for economic aid as of April 15, 1955,
              totalled $36 million. The $40.5 million for economic aid requested for <gloss

              concentrated on food and raw materials for subsistence purposes.</p>
            <p>5. In November 1954, discussions were held in Washington on economic matters between
              high-level representatives of the U.S. and Yugoslav Governments.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d241fn4">The discussions took place November 12–23, 1954; see <ref

              delegation made an extended presentation of Yugoslavia’s economic difficulties. The
              question of Yugoslavia’s medium and short-term indebtedness, which was discussed at
              the Washington talks, is under further study. Following the talks, an agreement was
              signed under which 425,000 tons of wheat and $10 million worth of cotton from surplus
              stocks were provided to Yugoslavia under Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
              480. Funds were authorized in the amount of $44.185 million to cover this wheat and
              cotton, and the ocean transportation thereof. The furnishing of these commodities was
              in addition to 275,000 tons of wheat (at a cost of $32 million) provided under Title
              II of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, and 150,000 tons (at a cost of $9
              million) provided in the Mutual Security Program, bringing the total of <gloss
                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 wheat to 850,000 tons as of the end of CY 1954. In
              February 1955 the Yugoslav Government requested an additional 286,000 tons to meet its
              needs until the new crop was harvested. As of April 13, 1955, this question had not
              been finally decided, but it appeared likely that this request would be given
              favorable consideration.</p>
            <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> program emphasized (a) growing military
              and economic strength of the West with U.S. support, (b) the values of cooperation
              among the free world powers, (c) U.S. measures of economic, technical and flood relief
              assistance to Yugoslavia, and (d) the dangers of too close a rapprochement with the
              Soviet bloc. As part of an extensive program of cultural relations, the stage play
              “Porgy and Bess” was performed with significant success in Yugoslavia. The U.S. is
              sounding out the Yugoslav Government with a view to sending an “Atoms for Peace”
              exhibit to Yugoslavia beginning with the Zagreb Trade Fair in September, 1955.</p>

            <p>9. The “normalization” of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc countries
              which had been evolving since mid-1953 was accelerated at Soviet initiative during the
              review period. While officially welcoming these developments, Yugoslav leaders claim
              that post-1948 ties with the West will not be impaired. Present signs are that
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is using his increased freedom of
              action resulting from the virtual cessation of Soviet orbit pressures against his
              regime to enhance Yugoslavia’s international prestige and position by becoming an
              active proponent, along with India, Burma, Egypt, etc., of a neutralist policy of
              non-alignment with either the Soviet or U.S. “bloc”. Although there is no reason for
              believing that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> has weakened in his
              determination to maintain his independence from the Soviet bloc, emerging developments
              in this regard call for continuing alert scrutiny with a view to influencing their
              direction in line with U.S. interests or, if necessary, to giving timely, basic
              reconsideration to our Yugoslav policy.</p>

              developments in the field of military cooperation between Yugoslavia and the West

              the settlement of the Trieste issue it had been thought desirable to attempt to
              strengthen the military ties between Yugoslavia and the West. At the moment, it is
              expected that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> will have
              a talk in the near future with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName>.
              The latter has promised to give the Ambassador Yugoslav thinking on the kind of
              relationship that might be established. Estimates of the probable Yugoslav attitude
              vary. The Turks feel the Yugoslavs are tending more and more toward a neutralist
              position. On the other hand, the Greeks believe that the Turks have been heavy handed
              in dealing with the Yugoslavs in staff discussions and that this Turkish opinion is
              not well founded. We feel a process of evolution is involved in Yugoslav thinking and
              recognize the necessity of re-examining the Yugoslav position in the light of recent
              developments. Before there is any general <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review
              of policy toward Yugoslavia, which has been proposed by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                >OCB</gloss>, the Department believes it desirable to await the outcome of
              Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName>’s talks with <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> stated he did not understand
              how we could give military aid to Yugoslavia, the total of which amounts to about $700
              million, under the terms of our military aid legislation which requires defense
              cooperation from the recipient country.</p>
            <p>Without answering this specific question, <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral
                Carney</persName> said that there were a few stipulations in our military aid
              agreement with Yugoslavia. However, the philosophy behind the agreement was that <pb
                n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0665"/>it represented a means for orienting Yugoslavia
              toward the West. In the Balkan Fact discussions the Turks had been reluctant to have
              frank military discussions with the Yugoslavs. The Turks themselves, according to
                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral Carney</persName>, have no settled strategic
              plan for dealing with the principal probable enemy, Bulgaria. The Greeks have been
              ready to talk details but the Turks have been unwilling. The Greeks and Yugoslavs have
              a certain amount of common real estate which gives them a solid interest in joint
              defense planning. The barrier with the Turks was partially broken in the recent
              tripartite Balkan alliance staff talks by labeling them merely theoretical exercises.
                <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Admiral Fechteler</persName> has told <persName
                corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral Carney</persName> that he doubts there will be any real
              defense cooperation in this are until the Yugoslavs and Italians are prepared to set
              down together. <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral Carney</persName> has tried to
              think of some way of bringing this about and even considered inviting Yugoslavia and
              Italian military representatives to the Naval Staff College and thus getting them in
              the same room together in hopes they might begin discussions. The problem is primarily
              political and <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Admiral Carney</persName> feels confident
              the Yugoslavs and Italians would agree on the military problems themselves, the
              principal one being the defense of the Ljubljana Gap.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that <persName
                corresp="#p_BDA1">Bebler</persName> had recently indicated that the Yugoslavs would
              probably only join in four power talks which include the U.S., UK and France along the
              lines of the August 1953 discussions. It is doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> will agree to the establishment of a relationship with <gloss
                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and this therefore makes uncertain the prospect of
              any Yugoslav-Italian relationship. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName>
              added that some kind of tie with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the exact
              nature of which we have not spelled out, would provide the best bridge for building a
              link with the Italians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> may now be more difficult following his
              trip to India and Burma and recent gestures from Moscow and may feel he is better able
              to occupy a middle position between the East and the West.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> then inquired if we felt the
              situation was not good. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we
              would not go far although he did feel the position of Yugoslavia was perhaps somewhat
              more in flux at the present time, that while it was not good, it was also not bad.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> reverted to the question of
              whether we can legally give military aid to Yugoslavia at which point Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> stated he had signed the military agreement with
              Yugoslavia on behalf of the U.S. and that it contained three conditions: (1)
              Yugoslavia would use the equipment only for defense purposes; (2) Yugoslavia undertook
              not to sell or dispose of the equipment without our agreement; and (3) Yugoslavia
              agreed we would have the right to inspect its end use.</p>
            <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0666"/>
            <p>The discussion on this matter concluded with <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral

              <label>1.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> indicated that he would prefer to
                hear me first and I, therefore, took advantage of this opening to recite our present
                difficulties with military aid program and some past history on economic aid. This
                consumed considerable time as difficulties on military aid are highly technical and
                as I gave copious illustrations to buttress various complaints. (Defense fully
                informed on these problems.) I pointed out that although these questions are for the
                most part technical, they do have political overtones particularly at this time when
                there have been doubts about the direction of Yugoslav foreign policy. <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> did not attempt to reply to my specific
                complaints but promised me that he [would] discuss at once with general staff the
                questions that are now pending and he thought many of them could be resolved. He
                told me, incidentally, that Dapcevic<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">Colonel General
                    <persName corresp="#p_DCGP1">Peko DapČević</persName>, Yugoslav Army Chief of
                  Staff.</note> was going to enter Parliament and that there would shortly be a new
                chief of staff. In saying so, he seemed to imply that this change in itself would
                lead to some improvement. I made it altogether clear that the pending questions in
                the military aid field were urgent and that if solutions were not found we would
                soon find ourselves in the position of having to suspend various shipments on
                technical grounds. Re economic aid, I recited the difficulties on the L/<gloss
                  target="#t_C1">C</gloss> question and pointed out that this long delay had clearly
                complicated the decision on additional wheat. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> gave the impression of agreeing with us on this matter but did
                not himself raise the Yugoslav need for additional wheat at this time.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> then said he wished to give me an
                explanation of present Yugoslav foreign policy. It is aimed, he said at the
                relaxation of tension in the world which is useful to all but basically Yugoslav
                Government has not changed the direction of its foreign policy. Yugoslav Government
                is particularly interested in improving its relations with US not only now but over
                long term. This is a fundamental postulate of Yugoslav Government policy and we
                should not think there has been any change. Normalization has not really gone very
                far although <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0670"/>though in <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s opinion it is essential to talk with eastern
                bloc at this time. Many outstanding difficulties still exist between Yugoslavia and
                eastern bloc and it will take a long time to erase them. USSR seems to have certain
                illusions about independence of Yugoslav foreign policy and these will have to to be
                eliminated. There have been, of course, certain benefits from normalization which
                  <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was sure that we would recognize,
                such as lessening of frontier pressure, cessation of propaganda, etc. I said we
                would and that were not unduly apprehensive over normalization developments.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>On Austria, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that Yugoslav
                Government was naturally gratified at developments and hoped that we would agree.
                Contrary to the case with <persName corresp="#p_RSFK1">Roberts</persName>, he went
                out of his way to explain that neutralization of Austria will not disturb the
                defense plans of the Western world. He was not in favor of “isolation of Western
                world”. On the other hand, West should not consider defense problems solely in terms
                of “line of bunkers” and that we should be aware of feeling amongst peoples of
                Europe that things were changing and that there were possibilities for future
                understanding. It was hope of Yugoslav foreign policy that eventually a united and
                peaceful Germany would emerge and West should perhaps now consider the possibility
                of discussions between the eastern and western Germanies through which a solution
                might be found to the primary problem of preventing a revival of German nationalism
                and militarism. At this point, I interrupted to give recital of all the efforts the
                West has made to attain this united and peaceful Germany and how these had been
                blocked by Soviet intransigence. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> did
                not disagree but neither did he attempt to reply. He agreed with me, however that
                the German problem must be approached with prudence and caution and that Austria is
                not a model for a solution.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that Yugoslav foreign policy
                today is based upon the idea of not joining any bloc. It is true that Yugoslav press
                has put Soviet bloc and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on same level and of
                course that is not strictly accurate. Nonetheless <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                  >NATO</gloss> does deserve some criticism on ideological grounds as it is
                important to remember that things are changing in the Soviet Union and the West
                should not lag behind. This does not mean that Yugoslavia should have any illusions
                about Soviet policy which certainly has a number of mental reservations in what it
                proposes.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> then mentioned the idea of neutral
                bloc and in response to my observations on Germany said that he agreed any such
                neutral bloc raised great problems. He thought that eventually the German problem
                could only be settled after some resolution of disarmament problems. In considering
                all this, Yugoslavia which is so close to the satellite countries had a basic
                interest in long-term prospects of good relations with the West. It was of primary
                importance to Yugoslavia <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0671"/>to maintain and
                develop these relations with the West and again he repeated that in this respect
                Yugoslav foreign policy has not changed.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>I then made my comment following very closely paragraph 1 of Deptel 857. I shall
                not repeat argumentation here but am certain I left him in no doubt as to our
                attitude on aid and military coordination. I made it clear that in our opinion it
                was essential to have a clear understanding of the fundamentals of future Yugoslav
                military relations with West and I said that we had reason to think this point was
                clearly understood at the time when <persName corresp="#p_BDA1">Bebler</persName>
                had made his original proposal. I emphasized the congressional emphasis on defense
                criteria for European aid and explained how difficult it would be to continue our
                programs unless there were some progress in the field of military
                coordination.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied by saying he realized there
                could be a different appraisal of the present international situation and indeed it
                was obvious that such differences do exist. However the situation was in a state of
                flux and perhaps the time would shortly come when we should sit down together and
                talk about how each of us appraised the present situation. As he seemed to imply
                that this should not be a purely Yugoslav-US meeting I asked him if he were
                proposing conversations with other powers as well. He then said that he thought we
                should discuss how such a meeting should be arranged and that in his opinion it
                should probably not be held before June. At this point I reminded <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> again that we had many urgent problems to
                resolve in the field of military aid and that we had certain duties and obligations
                under our laws and the bilateral agreement which we must execute. I said that too
                much delay was certain to create the impression that Yugoslavia had lost interest in
                the military aid program and that its attitude coupled with difficulties on economic
                aid was certain to influence Washington. He rejected most strongly the idea that
                Yugoslavia had lost interest in the military aid program but said he understood how
                the question of priorities might arise. I said I could not see much point in a
                “purely technical conference” which might be confined to matters of additional
                military aid when we had been unable to resolve a number of urgent questions based
                upon our present aid program. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied
                that we could expect the general staff proposals on a “technical conference” within
                the next few days.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>I then raised the question of military planning under the Balkan alliance and
                tried to ascertain his thinking on future developments. On this he was evasive and
                said he understood we did receive the information. I then cited some technical
                problems to illustrate again how military aid was linked to planning but I did not
                succeed in eliciting much information. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                finally said that he recognized this problem was closely related to that of larger
                military coordination.</item>
              <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0672"/>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>In conclusion, I once more reiterated my belief that at some point the military
                assistance program must be related to joint planning and that if it were not done
                the question of priorities on aid would certainly arise. Again I indicated our
                position on military coordination was flexible but progress was essential. The
                atmosphere of interview was friendly with no recriminations on either side. I had
                strong impression however that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was more
                than a little unhappy at some of my observations on US policy but I think this
                interview served the purpose of clearing the air.</item>

              was pleased to have this opportunity for a further exchange of views prior to his
              departure.</p>
            <p>Referring to their conversation on April 29,<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">During this
                meeting on April 29, originally scheduled to discuss Yugoslavia’s application for an
                Export-Import Bank loan, <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> had stated his
                belief that, as a result of the recent <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"

              was now fully briefed on the <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>–<persName

              could reaffirm that there was no change in our attitude toward Yugoslavia, although
              Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName>’s talk with <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had emphasized that some question marks had
              arisen. As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> well understood, we
              have an important economic and military <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0673"/>stake
              in Yugoslavia. If our aid was to continue, Congress must know in which direction
              Yugoslavia was going. The same consideration applied where aid to other countries was
              concerned. The normalization process had given rise to some doubts in the American
              public as to the road Yugoslavia was taking. We were still not quite sure. <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had given Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"
                >Riddleberger</persName> the impression that Yugoslav independence, which had been
              our common objective justifying our military aid program, was now more or less secure,
              and the implication was that further aid was perhaps no longer desirable. At this
              juncture, we believe that joint military planning with the West must be a necessary
              accompaniment to further military aid. Although we are flexible on the form such
              planning should take, we feel that we cannot go ahead with any large military aid
              program without it.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> replied that since his visit
              on Friday he had received a report of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"
                >Riddleberger</persName>’s recent talk with the Foreign Minister.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d245fn4">This conversation has not been identified. In telegram 885 from
                Belgrade, May 1, <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> reported on a

                officials on the issue of military planning. (Department of State, Central Files,
                  768.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/4–3055)</note> The report had cleared up
              a number of misapprehensions he had formed on the basis of his initial impression of

                >Riddleberger</persName> conversation. He was now more comfortable in his mind and
              assumed that further talks would occur in Belgrade. He said that Yugoslavia was not
              planning any switches, and that as for normalization, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> and Popovic could give the necessary explanations. He understood
              that since the normalization process began, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"

                >Tito</persName> had open to him three main choices: (1) to tie up more firmly to

              forge strong military ties with the Western powers. We feel, he said, that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will pursue a policy of benevolent neutralism
              (benevolent to the West) while seeking to maintain correct relations with the Soviet
              bloc. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt that we should not look or recent
              developments in Yugoslavia as signifying a switch in <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s policies, but rather a drift which derived its direction from the
              new trends in Soviet policy. It seemed likely that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> was actually looking forward to joining up with a Middle European
              neutral bloc of nations including Austria and perhaps ultimately Germany. It was his
              ambition to keep the two power groups apart and ultimately to achieve a peaceful
              solution. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> concluded by reading the final paragraph of
              the intelligence estimate on Yugoslavia.</p>

              Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that of course

                    ><ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note> and that from Yugoslav point of
                view a good time would be following the visit of the Burmese <persName

                now tentatively fixed for first week in June. He said that he thought Belgrade would
                be the best place and he would suggest utilizing the Ambassadors here for meetings
                with Yugoslav Government representatives. I replied that I was not yet sure what
                countries he had in mind and in particular whether his idea envisaged including
                Greece and Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied that in his
                opinion it would be preferable to have a quadripartite meeting of the US, UK, French
                and Yugoslavs.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Bearing in mind paragraph (1) of Deptel 879, I said to <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> perhaps we could have another conversation
                after the conclusion of the <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> visit
                which would give us an opportunity to discuss this suggestion in a quiet place. (Our
                conversation was held in the middle of one of the reception rooms at the White
                Palace where we were surrounded by guests. As we spoke German, I doubt however if
                our conversation was understood by anyone near us.) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> agreed this would be a good idea and we left it at that.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Earlier in the evening Foreign Secretary told me that he realized Yugoslav
                Government had promised us a reply in few days on various matters including the
                tripartite démarche of February 10<note n="7" xml:id="d247fn7">Reported in telegram
                  654 from Belgrade, February 10. (Department of State, Central Files,
                  760.5/2–1055)</note> and he apologized for the delay. This is clearly an allusion
                to what <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had referred to as general
                staff proposals. He said however he was so taken up with the Turkish visit that it
                had not been possible but again reiterated Yugoslav Government intention to give
                response in the very near future. In thanking him, I again remarked that while the
                wheat problem had been solved there were still the urgent questions of the military
                aid program and that I hoped that Yugoslav Government responses would shortly be
                forthcoming.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Subsequent to these two conversations I informed my UK and French colleagues of
                their substance and <persName corresp="#p_RSFK1">Roberts</persName> told me that he
                had likewise had a short conversation with Foreign Secretary, following my
                conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. <persName
                  corresp="#p_RSFK1">Roberts</persName> asked Foreign Secretary how <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> proposal would fit in with reply which he had
                promised within a <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0677"/>few day. <persName
                  corresp="#p_RSFK1">Roberts</persName> told Foreign Secretary London was inclined
                to view favorably the idea of a meeting but had not made up its mind on timing,
                scope, etc. He asked whether Yugoslav Government would make proposals on the
                military problems and Popovic replied that Yugoslav Government could very well make
                replies on the military side as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                proposal did not exclude technical military exchanges. <persName corresp="#p_RSFK1"
                  >Roberts</persName> later saw <persName corresp="#p_VDJ1">Vilfan</persName> and
                put the same question to him but did not obtain much information. Both <persName
                  corresp="#p_RSFK1">Roberts</persName> and I had impression that neither Foreign
                Secretary nor <persName corresp="#p_VDJ1">Vilfan</persName> were fully informed
                respecting <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s conversation with me and

                    probably be held with minimum of publicity. Three Ambassadors agree it would
                    probably not be necessary to have agreed agenda but meeting, in the context of
                      <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s original proposal to me, would
                    probably discuss our respective estimates of the present international

                confidential until published.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>In view of importance of this meeting Foreign Secretary said he wished to advise
                tripartite powers and Yugoslav allies in Balkan Alliance together with following
                comment: Yugoslav Government welcomes this initiative (I could not extract from
                Foreign Secretary whose initiative) which has as its background a long period of
                Soviet political attacks against Yugoslavia. Whatever usefulness the meeting may
                have, Yugoslav policy is clear and is based as stated before on postulates of full
                equality of rights and non-interference. Yugoslav Government will not support any
                “destructive efforts” of USSR and meeting will provide opportunity to probe Soviet
                intentions. Yugoslav Government thinks it may be possible to settle certain
                practical questions of normalization in course of this meeting and if such is case
                it will be most helpful. If Soviet Government does not exhibit sincerity, then
                Yugoslav Government will be able to judge its intentions with more clarity.
                Therefore Yugoslav Government will believe it is useful to have meeting and thinks
                the conference is in full accord with all other efforts and negotiations now
                underway or impending to achieve a relaxation of tensions.</item>

              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Foreign Secretary said he wished to emphasize once more that this meeting in no
                sense implied a change in fundamental Yugoslav Government policy of good and cordial
                relations with Western countries. He reverted to this theme three times during
                course of conversations and and underlined that Yugoslav efforts paralleled those of
                West.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Foreign Secretary laid particular emphasis on fact that meeting will be held in
                Belgrade which he interprets as a great victory for Yugoslav policy of firmness in
                face of earlier Soviet threats. In saying that this is a common victory for all of
                us he declared that Yugoslav Government policy of firmness had been made possible by
                support it had received from Western countries and in particular from US. As
                Yugoslav Government has said before it hopes this meeting represents a real change
                in Soviet attitude and if Soviet intentions are sincere it may be a great step
                towards a peaceful world.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Foreign Secretary then said he recognized that guidance to or influence on press
                was a delicate matter but that he very much hoped some way could be found to present
                this meeting as a new step towards maintenance of peace and to avoid any possible
                “negative reactions”. I said I thought news of this meeting would be a sensation and
                it was difficult to predict what the press reaction would be.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>At conclusion of his observations I tried to ascertain if this conference would
                be followed by a high-level visit to Moscow. Foreign Secretary replied that this was
                a conference and not a visit but did not give me a direct answer. I was not able to
                obtain much information on agenda beyond fact that questions affecting normalization
                would be discussed and in particular a number of practical matters. In response to
                my observation that calibre of Soviet delegation was so high that important results
                could be anticipated, Foreign Secretary confined reply to saying meeting would
                provide real opportunity to test sincerity of Soviet intentions, as Soviet
                delegation was composed of those authorized to make decisions.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>When reading list of Soviet delegation, but not in response to any question of
                mine, Foreign Secretary volunteered information that <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                  >Molotov</persName> was not coming and perhaps this had a certain significance in
                view of his association with earlier and highly antagonistic policy of USSR against
                Yugoslavia. He also observed that he thought <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                  >Molotov</persName>’s position was none too strong.</item>

                  conference. He suggested that <persName>Dulles</persName> meet with Ambassador
                    <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> to inform him of U.S. concern

            <p>The Yugoslav Ambassador called on the Secretary at 2:30 this afternoon at the
              latter’s request. The Secretary opened the conversation by saying that whereas, as the
              Ambassador knew, there were certain difficulties in connection with the operation in
              Yugoslavia of our military aid program (which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"
                >Riddleberger</persName> had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal
                Tito</persName> and the Foreign Minister), the Secretary did not want to get this
              matter mixed up with the visit of the Soviet leaders to Belgrade. Accordingly we were
              not raising this matter further at this time though it was a matter which we felt was
              important to work out and one to which we would revert in the future.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then went on to say that he felt that the visit of the Soviet leaders
              to Belgrade was a real triumph for <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal
                Tito</persName> and testimony to the soundness of his policy of independence which
              he had pursued since 1948 with such great courage and despite great risks. We had, as
              the Ambassador knew, attempted to mitigate that risk by our relations with the
              Yugoslav Government and in particular by our contribution of economic and military
              aid. As he had said recently in another connection, the Secretary felt that proof of
              the success of a policy was the worst of all possible reasons to abandon it and
              consequently he would be gratified by the assurances from Belgrade that the Yugoslav
              Government had no intention of modifying its existing independent policies which the
              Secretary felt had been of benefit not only to Yugoslavia but to others.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> responded by saying that he
              appreciated what the Secretary had just said. He wanted to reaffirm that the
              initiative for this visit had come from the Soviets. The Yugoslav Government
              considered this visit as a beginning rather than an end in the sense that they did not
              expect important decisions to be reached but that they hoped further normalization of
              their relations with the Soviet bloc would follow. There was no agenda for the talks
              but the Yugoslavs would plan to bring up certain matters such as their claims for
              damages against the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName> had
              made clear that there would be no secret agreements arising from the talks and that
                <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0681"/>he would keep the United States Government
              and other friendly governments fully informed of their results.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador then said that he was aware in a general way of the difficulties which
              had arisen in the military aid program. He indicated that he felt confident the
              difficulties could be straightened out. His impression was that the problems were with
              the Army rather than either with the Air Force or the Navy and he made a somewhat
              cryptic remark to the effect that he thought personalities might enter into this. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> explained that our law required that
              we satisfy ourselves that military equipment turned over by US be put to the use for
              which it was intended and that we must satisfy ourselves that it was properly used and
              maintained. The Ambassador gave the impression of understanding the problem and again
              indicated that he thought it could be worked out to our mutual satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador then asked the Secretary if there was anything he could be told
              concerning the impending meeting of the four heads of government. The Secretary
              explained at some length the philosophy underlying our concept of the meeting and
              emphasized that insofar as this country was concerned the two major causes of tension
              with the Soviets were, first, the captivity of the satellite people (who had million
              of relatives in this country) and the conspiratorial activity in friendly countries of
              Communist parties dominated and controlled by the Soviets. He gave a general
              indication of the range of subjects which might come up though he said, like the
              meeting in Belgrade, it would presumably be one without an agenda.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then asked if the Ambassador had any objection to his issuing the
              attached statement to the press after the Ambassador departed.<note n="2"
                xml:id="d249fn2">For text of the press release, see Department of State <hi

              agreed and said that he would confine his remarks to the press to the statement that
              he had had a long and friendly talk with the Secretary and that he had nothing to add
              to the statement which the Secretary had issued.</p>

              <item>Tonight at <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> reception for Soviet
                Delegation I was requested, as were several other Chiefs of Mission, to join party
                for supper where I had 40-minute conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                  >Khrushchev</persName>. As discussion became quite animated and practically
                stopped all other conversation, I am reporting it in some detail as I am sure there
                will be press accounts appearing tomorrow. I had distinct impression it was a
                planned affair but perhaps went further than Yugoslavs anticipated. In addition to
                Soviet Delegation all the top Yugoslav hierarchy was present and two or three other
                of the Mission Chiefs here.</item>

              <item><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> opened the conversation by
                giving a lecture on corn production and complaining of US criticism. He said that we
                had failed to comprehend what he had in mind and that in bringing new land into
                production for corn he was not contemplating grain but silage. It was essential to
                increase meat production in USSR and he was convinced that Siberian lands were
                suitable for this type of production. I replied I was not aware of US criticism
                against raising food production but that growing of corn in my experience was a
                question of sufficient moisture and perhaps there had been some allusion to the
                suitability of certain land. I said in any case the question was an agricultural one
                and not ideological and that perhaps something could be gained from our experience
                in dry farming in the West.</item>

              <item><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by complaining of a
                general US misunderstanding of Soviet motives insisting that USSR wanted good
                relations with all countries. He implied that he had the same feeling re Yugoslav
                relations with other countries and referred to his remarks when he arrived in
                  Belgrade.<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">An unofficial translation of <persName

                  maintain relations with all States both in the West and in the East has met with
                  complete understanding on our part. We consider the strengthening of friendship

              <label>4.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that one of the greatest
                difficulties at arriving at settlement of problems was US determination to negotiate
                from “a position of strength.” He cited recent statements by the President and the
                Secretary as evidence of US desire to make more difficult the peaceful solution of
                outstanding problems by negotiation and complained of an American desire to dominate
                by force. I replied that positions of strength were certainly not unknown to the
                USSR and recalled that in recent years his country had not been averse to utilizing
                its strength for purposes of pressure. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                  >Khrushchev</persName> asked what I meant and I replied that I could personally
                recall such pressure as the Berlin blockade since I happened to be in Berlin at that
                time. He then dropped this part of conversation by remarking that perhaps each side
                could criticize the other for various acts and I said that our decisions were
                invariably based upon defense considerations. He then made some obscure remark which
                seemed to be a complaint about our position on the satellite countries but did not
                pursue the matter further.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then launched into a long
                dissertation on Communism versus Capitalism and complained that we did not
                understand the desires of the working classes throughout the world. I said that
                perhaps I had had the advantage of having been both in the US and USSR and that my
                observation was that the working classes in the US were certainly benefitting to a
                high degree from the general prosperity. I said I thought whatever the approach to
                distribution of wealth might be it certainly had to be admitted that Capitalism in
                the US had brought great benefit to the working classes. At this point <persName
                  corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> got red in the face and became highly
                personal. He said that I could not possibly understand the attitude of the working
                classes and their outlook. I replied dryly that I was quite prepared to match my
                experience as one of the laboring classes with his. This seemed to surprise him
                somewhat and he asked what I meant. I said that as a young man I had been a farm
                hand, an iceman, a painter, an apple picker and had worked at a number of other
                jobs. I said that there could be no greater illusion than to believe that all
                Americans whom he happened to meet at parties had no manual labor background. This
                terminated the discussion on Communism and Capitalism.</item>

              <item>Subject to more official Yugoslav interpretation when I see Foreign Secretary,
                following is our preliminary analysis and comment Soviet-Yugoslav conference.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Yugoslavia succeeded obtaining Soviet recognition “different forms socialist
                development are solely concern of individual countries” thus Soviets yielded on
                issue which heretofore has been basic. Yielding was done by <persName
                  corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> in name of Soviet Government and not by
                  <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in name of Communist party.
                Nonetheless this is acknowledgement of Yugoslav position on one of main issues
                between <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0685"/>them and Soviet Union with possible
                consequences not only in satellites but other Communist parties. This recognition
                partially offset by Yugoslavs associating themselves with USSR as countries with
                common interest in socialism.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Yugoslavs have obtained recognition their policy condemnation of military blocs
                although this doubtful value to west.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Although vaguely worded Yugoslavs give impression of supporting “establishment
                of general system of collective security including system of collective security in
                Europe based on treaty” which implies approval of <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                  >Molotov</persName> security plan.<note n="3" xml:id="d251fn3">Reference is to the
                  Soviet proposals at the Berlin Conference of January–February 1954 on European
                  Security and the general European Treaty. For texts, see <ref

                of putting establishment such security system before German settlement which is
                probably useful for Soviet propaganda. In addition, Yugoslavs now officially support
                pretentions of Chinese Communists to Formosa. Linking of these questions to security
                pact seems clear indication that Soviets have extracted more far reaching
                concessions than Yugoslavs indicated they would grant although it can be argued by
                Yugoslavs these problems only to be solved by creation conditions of confidence and
                lessening of tension.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Yugoslavs seem clearly to have given their support to Soviet effort to break
                down controls on shipment strategic materials by favoring “removal of all those
                factors in economic relations which impede exchange of goods.”</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Yugoslavs give impression of having adopted Soviet position on prohibition of
                atomic weapons although this may be subject to later interpretation.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>Re Section 3 of joint declaration it seems clear further steps for normalization
                are contemplated and that closer economic cooperation is envisaged. There is no hint
                of any monetary compensation to Yugoslavs but these matters may be subject of later
                negotiation. It may well be that if Soviets are contemplating any compensation they
                will hold out until they see how subsequent negotiations develop.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>Statement re mutual cooperation on peaceful uses of atomic energy implies
                Soviets will assist Yugoslavs but this may be hint to us to offer more
                assistance.</item>
              <label>9.</label>
              <item>Although question party relationships is not mentioned reasonable interpretation
                Section 3 paragraph 7 would indicate closer relationships, perhaps through trade
                unions, are envisaged. Yugoslavs claim they hope to influence Soviets through this
                declaration. I am told there was terrific battle re this paragraph with Soviets
                demanding much more and Yugoslavs resisting attempts re-establish party ties.</item>

              <label>10.</label>
              <item><p>Impressions: (A) Most high Yugoslav officials with whom tripartite
                  Ambassadors talked last night expressed themselves as highly satisfied with
                  outcome negotiations and thought Yugoslav Government had successfully resisted
                  Soviet pressure. Yugoslav officials claim they most careful on phrasing of
                  paragraphs re European security and German problem although this hardly borne out
                  by declaration. It does not detract from damage to free world interests that most
                  of positions in which Yugoslavs have associated themselves with Soviets were ones
                  which Yugoslavs had already expressly or impliedly taken. In short Soviets
                  astutely took advantage of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s already
                  demonstrated neutralist tendencies.</p>
                <p>(B) In spite of unsatisfactory character of declaration, there is good reason to
                  believe atmosphere of conference widened rather than narrowed gap between Soviets
                  and Yugoslavs. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> who was optimistic
                  about visit is reported from good sources to have been clearly disillusioned re
                  real Soviet attitude and is not so convinced as formerly of Soviet peaceful
                  intentions.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> also reportedly shocked at some of
                  conversations at Brioni where Soviet boasted World War I had brought communism to
                  Russia, World War II had added Eastern Europe and China and World War III would
                  see it spread throughout world. This shocked <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                    >Tito</persName> who above all wants avoid World War III. <persName
                    corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> also reported as shaken by frank statements
                  of continuation of Stalinist line inside USSR. Other high Yugoslav leaders regard
                  Soviet leaders as second-rate and have doubts about their capacity to conduct
                  negotiations with West. From one excellent source I learned <persName
                    corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> apparently defended West most vigorously at
                  Brioni. Another high Yugoslav official told me Yugoslavs resisted until last their
                  mention of Formosa but finally gave in because it consistent with their general
                  position on China. Another source said Yugoslav Government had no desire to see
                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> dislocated.</p></item>

              <item>UK, Turkish, Greek and US Ambassadors conferred today on their analyses. UK,
                French and Greek thought declaration, although unfortunate in some of its phrasing,
                not too discouraging from viewpoint of West. Turkish Ambassador and I were more
                pessimistic in our analyses. Subject to what Yugoslav Government may tell us
                officially, five Ambassadors were of opinion conference with tripartite powers
                should be held if only for purpose of ascertaining real Yugoslav position following

            <p>[Here follows discussion of a subject unrelated to Yugoslavia.]</p>
            <p>2. We discussed the problem of Yugoslavia. I said that the Defense people had choked
              off the military pipeline so that from now on nothing would be going forward. I said
              that I felt that they saw the matter primarily in terms of building Yugoslavia into a
              strategic group linking Turkey and Greece with the forces of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> in Western Europe, and that with this prospect dim, the Defense
              people, or at least the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, saw no future in military
              aid to Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>I said that I considered it extremely unlikely that Yugoslavia would ever again go
              under the yoke of Moscow leadership because it would be very stupid of them to do so
              unless pressed by powerful economic necessity. I said I rather foresaw that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> now had the ambition to make himself the leader
              of a group of Communist states and attract them away from Moscow. I had particularly
              in mind Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria. I said that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> had stood for the <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0689"/>Bukharin
              brand of Communism which believed that you would have Communism on a national basis
              and that Communist countries need not necessarily be under the iron discipline of the
              Soviet Communist Party as the leader of the world proletariat.</p>
            <p>I said that if this was his ambition, it was one that we could afford quietly to
              countenance.</p>
            <p>I reported that we felt there was need to take some new soundings in Yugoslavia; that
              the suggestion had been made that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">General
                Collins</persName> should go but I thought that <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> would be better qualified, having regard to the delicate
              political nature of the task. The President expressed himself as very strongly of this
              same view and said he did not think that <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1"
                >Collins</persName> would be the right person to send.</p>
            <p>Subsequently speaking with the President on the phone, he said that I could authorize
                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, at his discretion and if he thought
              it was important, to convey an invitation from the President to <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to visit the United States sometime during the
              latter part of this year. He did not want this used unless it seemed really
              necessary.</p>

            <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>We believe that the dominant concerns of the Yugoslav regime, at least so long
                as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> remains alive, will be to insure its
                own survival free of foreign domination and to advance its own influence and
                prestige on the world scene. Despite <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
                Marxist world outlook, we believe that he will continue to regard his interests to
                be best served from a flexible position in which Yugoslavia can achieve benefits
                from both power blocs with a minimum of commitments to either. (Paras. 23,
                25)</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>We have carefully considered the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> may have decided that his interests can best be served from a
                position within rather than outside the Communist orbit, and that he has made an
                agreement with Moscow to rejoin the Bloc. His present maneuvers might thus be
                designed to prepare the way for open acknowledgment of such an agreement. We
                consider it unlikely, however, that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> has
                come to this decision or has made such an agreement with Moscow. Even if he were
                fully convinced that the USSR <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0691"/>was prepared
                to take Yugoslavia back, not as a Satellite but as a partner, a position in the Bloc
                would still offer <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and his key
                associates great personal danger and would be unlikely to offer any great advantages
                to compensate for the loss of world-wide influence and prestige which <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s independent policies have won for him. (Para.
                  24)<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">Footnote in the source text [<hi rend="italic">14
                    lines of source text</hi>] not declassified.</note></item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will continue to take advantage of
                opportunities to profit by the USSR’s present show of friendship, to test Soviet
                good faith, and to encourage the readjustment of Soviet relationships with the
                Satellites and with the non-Communist world which he hopes is in the making. This
                process is likely to be marked not only by further economic and cultural cooperation
                but also by cautious moves toward re-establishment of party-to-party relations.
                (Paras. 26–30)</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>However, we believe that as long as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                is in power this process of political rapprochement will not result in Yugoslavia’s
                realignment with the Bloc unless the USSR proves willing to make such modifications
                in the nature of its relationships with the Satellites as to convince <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> that he would have real opportunities for
                independent leadership and influence in the Communist world. We feel safe in
                estimating that there is a pro-Soviet element in the Yugoslav Communist Party that
                is now pressing for closer ties with Moscow, but we are uncertain as to its
                leadership and extent. However, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is
                clearly in firm control. In the event of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName>’s death such a pro-Soviet element could well exert dominant
                influence, especially if a confused struggle for power took place. (Paras.
                31–34)</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Given a continuation of the USSR’s present conciliatory behavior, Yugoslavia
                will probably continue to preach “peaceful coexistence” and may toy with the idea of
                some form of buffer alignment in Europe. It will support various Soviet and Chinese
                Communist diplomatic moves, and will display increasing indifference toward its
                military ties with the West. However, it will still wish aid and trade ties with the
                West, will display continuing interest in economic regional cooperation with Western
                states, and will look to the West as a potential source of support against possible
                Soviet designs. (Paras. 32, 35–37)</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Yugoslavia’s adherence to its Balkan Alliance commitments in time of war is
                doubtful, and its wartime usefulness to the West is uncertain. We believe that the
                Yugoslav regime would endeavor to remain neutral in a general war, at least until
                the situation clarified. We also believe, however, that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> would fight if directly attacked, and might also enter the war,
                not because of his Balkan Alliance commitments, but as a consequence of his judgment
                as to the course of hostilities and as to the advantages which he might gain from
                participation. <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0692"/>Ultimately, <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> might consider it advantageous, and perhaps
                even essential for the survival of his regime, to join the winning side before the
                end of hostilities. (Paras. 37–38)</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>Present US ability to affect the process of readjustment in Yugoslavia’s
                international position is limited: <list>
                  <label>a.</label>
                  <item>Although the Yugoslavs desire additional US military and more particularly
                    economic aid, they would almost certainly refuse to make more than minor
                    concessions to obtain it. They are probably prepared to accept a substantial
                    reduction in military aid. (Paras. 40–41, 44)</item>
                  <label>b.</label>
                  <item>Should a substantial reduction in economic aid actually take place,
                    Yugoslavia’s ability to pursue major economic goals would be severely limited,
                    and its tendency to look to the Bloc for increased trade and credits, which will
                    in any case be evident, would be intensified. However, such a cut would not
                    critically endanger Yugoslavia’s economic viability if the regime accepted the
                    need for austerity measures, and we do not believe that <persName
                      corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> would allow himself to become economically
                    subservient to the Bloc. (Paras. 41–43)</item>
                  <label>c.</label>
                  <item>A substantial reduction in US economic aid would cause considerable Yugoslav
                    resentment and would somewhat impair <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                      >Tito</persName>’s bargaining position as against Moscow, though it would not
                    in itself impel the Yugoslavs to move politically closer to the Bloc. (Para.

            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Factors Governing Yugoslavia’s Position:</hi></p>
            <p>There are a number of factors operating to pull Yugoslavia’s leaders towards and
              others to draw them away from both the Soviet bloc and the Free World, The primary
              lure of the Soviet orbit results from the ideological affinities between it and the
              Yugoslav regime, now partially reflected in a renewal of Communist Party ties. While
              there can hardly be any significant faction in the Yugoslav Communist Party whose
              primary loyalty is to the USSR rather than to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>, it is nevertheless true that many Yugoslav Communists feel more at
              ease in a Communist milieu—which is only natural in view of their backgrounds and
              their still proclaimed belief in the inevitability of the eventual socialization
              (though not necessarily via revolutionary methods) of the entire world. Reinforcing
              these considerations is the fact that the Soviet bloc is a natural economic and
              trading partner for Yugoslavia. This was highlighted on September 1 by a new
              Soviet-Yugoslav economic agreement which provides in principle for a much expanded
              level of trade in each of the next three years ($35,000,000 in each direction),
              generous Soviet credits for the purchase of Soviet raw materials ($54,000,000 over a
              three-year period to be repaid in 10 years at 2 percent interest), a $30,000,000
              Soviet “gold” loan (on identical repayment terms), miscellaneous investment loans in
              medium-sized fertilizer plants and mines, and the promise of peaceful atomic energy
              collaboration. According to the chief Yugoslav negotiator, Vice-President <persName
                corresp="#p_VTSN1">Vukmanovic-Tempo</persName>, the program will require further
              discussion of and agreement on details in January 1956 before implementation can
              begin. From the still incomplete information now available, it does not appear that
              carrying out this new accord with the USSR will necessarily involve the Yugoslavs in
              any Battle Act<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">The Mutual Defense Control Act of 1951,
                approved October 26, 1951, forbade U.S. assistance to countries shipping strategic
                goods to Soviet-dominated areas; 65 Stat. 644.</note> violations. Besides these
              economic and ideological factors, the Yugoslavs will also be inclined to accommodate
              themselves to the Soviet Union to the extent that they consider that this assists them
              in the active pursuit of their goal of obtaining a position of leadership in an
              Eastern Europe composed of national Communist (Titoist) states—a goal which can only
              be reached if the Soviets agree to relax their grip on some of the satellites.</p>
            <p>Countervailing factors inclining the Yugoslav regime toward the Free World are also
              numerous. First of all, popular sympathies (which probably extend even to a majority
              of rank and file Party members) are overwhelmingly oriented towards the West. Although
              the regime does enjoy secure control over the internal political scene, anti-Western
              policies would only increase latent discontent. Secondly, <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666"
                facs="0694"/>despite recent trade and economic agreements with the Soviet orbit, the
              Yugoslav economy and its commerce will still be predominantly tied to the Free World
              both for normal commercial transactions (70%–80% of total trade) and for special
              credits and economic assistance. Thirdly, potential military threats to Yugoslavia
              come only from the Soviet bloc. Moreover, a flow of spare parts and replacement
              equipment from the West (primarily from the U.S.) is essential for the maintenance of
              the armed forces. A fourth consideration stems from <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"

              he will lose if he resubmerges himself into or identifies himself too closely with the
              Soviet bloc. Finally, the regime is interested in maintaining its special ties to Free
              World Social-Democratic parties, which would probably cease if Yugoslavia became too
              closely identified again with the Soviet world.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Yugoslavia and United States Policy
                Objectives:</hi></p>
            <p>The divergent factors influencing the regime have led it to adopt a policy of playing
              one side off against the other to extract the maximum gain possible for itself. This
              policy precludes over-attachment to either major world power grouping and, they
              believe, offers the best hope of preserving the nation’s military and economic
              strength and independence. At the same time, it allows Yugoslavia to maintain good
              relations with both East and West and to be especially active in promoting a
              world-wide détente (in recognition of the fact that a major war would be likely to be
              fatal to the regime regardless of the winning side).</p>
            <p>Since the United States shares the regime’s own objective of an independent and
              reasonably strong Yugoslavia, it is willing to countenance the regime’s tactics in the
              full realization that the regime will continue to utilize every suitable form of
              pressure available to gain further concessions and support from the U.S. In this
              situation, it is in the U.S. interest to maximize the pull upon Yugoslavia of the
              above-enumerated factors inclining Yugoslavia to the Free World and to minimize
              attractions to the Soviet orbit.</p>

            <p>In a desire to bolster Yugoslavia’s position during the period of great Soviet
              pressure against <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> (July 1948–1954), the
              U.S. has made available sizable amounts of military and economic assistance to
              Yugoslavia. In the past several years, the U.S. has given Yugoslavia $503,200,000
              worth of economic aid (almost all in the form of grants), well over half of which
              consisted of shipments of food and other agricultural surplus commodities. In
              addition, the Export-Import Bank has extended Yugoslavia a long-term loan of
              $55,000,000, and U.S. backing has been an important factor in getting <pb n="667"

              an eventual balance of Yugoslavia’s foreign payments.<note n="4" xml:id="d255fn4">The

                1955. Congress questioned the wisdom of a continued appropriation for Yugoslavia in
                the amounts suggested by the administration, in view of Yugoslavia’s increased
                neutrality and apparent rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Congress also expressed
                concern over Yugoslavia’s lack of cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_AMAS1"

                    discouraging Yugoslav ambitions in this direction, but bearing in mind both the

                    progress of the discussions, to advise the Yugoslavs that the U.S. is ready to

              to engage in discussions concerning various matters of mutual interest, I was happy to
              have this opportunity to address myself personally to you and to express my hope and
              expectation that his conversations with you and other members of your Government will
              result in a useful contribution to the good relations between our countries.</p>
            <p>I know that we both firmly share a common desire to see an evolution and improvement
              of the international atmosphere take place so that the world will be freed from the
              threat of war and human and material resources now used for military purposes can be
              diverted to improving living standards. The United States Government is now engaged in
              working on the many diplomatic problems involved, some of which will be discussed at
              the forthcoming conference of Foreign Ministers in Geneva. The interim period, during
              which the outcome of new trends is still uncertain, is, of course, a difficult time
              for us all, and I can appreciate the pertinence of the many ideas on world issues
              expressed from time to time by representatives of your Government to American
              officials, even when they do not wholly accord with the outlook prevailing in my
              country. It is my hope that in the trying but hopeful months ahead, nations such as
              ours, which have stood together through the adversities of recent years, will continue
              their close association and will work to resolve mutual problems in a spirit of
              conciliation for their common benefit and as part of the general attempt to relieve
              the world-wide tensions which have been so menacing to us all.</p>
            <p>I know that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> will wish to exchange
              views with you and your officials on the general trend of world affairs and that also
              some of the joint programs in Yugoslavia in which the United States participates with
              your Government will enter into his conversations. It is hardly necessary for me to
              observe that the United States has always sought to implement these programs in all
              countries in a spirit of full equality corresponding to the conviction that any
              effective international cooperation depends on the free and voluntary <pb n="670"
                xml:id="pg_670" facs="0698"/>choice by the people and government of each side of the
              agreed course of collaboration. In pursuance of this fundamental principle, Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> will wish to discuss various questions
              bearing upon our military relationships and the United States military assistance
              program for Yugoslavia. The purpose of the aid program has always been clear to me. I
              have assumed that we shared a common objective—the achievement of a posture of
              Yugoslav military strength sufficient to discourage incursions onto Yugoslav soil by
              potential aggressors. You will, no doubt, agree that it would be untimely to relax
              vigilance while international affairs still remain in an unsettled state.</p>
            <p>I am sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> will be anxious to
              be helpful in discussing any matters which you feel can profitably be raised at this
              time and that he will faithfully relay to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                >Dulles</persName> and to me your views on questions of mutual concern.</p>

              the Yugoslavs and the United States. He said he was also pleased at the increased
              influence Yugoslavia was playing <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0699"/>in that part
              of the world. He said that while the United States did not agree with the Yugoslav
              form of government, we did agree with the independent nationalistic line they are
              taking and that he personally was not all all worried about the new ties the Yugoslavs
              were developing with the Soviet Union. He said that Yugoslavia had managed to assert
              their independence and their present approach to international relations was a sound
              example to the rest of the world. The Secretary continued that while there might be
              less United States military aid to Yugoslavia, we were still anxious to support their
              independence and enhance their prestige, but that the United States was not at all
              anxious to have them considered a part of the United States bloc.</p>
            <p>Popovic replied that he was very pleased to hear the Secretary’s views and that
              considering present circumstances it was quite logical that United States military aid
              should diminish. He pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              himself had said good United States-Yugoslav relations should not depend on United
              States military aid and that excellent relations could endure even if United States
              aid became superfluous.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then introduced the subject of Greece and Turkey and said that the
              situation had been allowed to get completely out of hand; that emotion bred emotion
              and that since Papagos was a very sick man, there was nobody in the Greek Government
              strong enough to sober up the country. He said the situation threatened the Balkan
              Alliance, that there was great need for a strong government in Greece so that Greece
              and Turkey could continue as active members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              and the Balkan Alliance.</p>
            <p>Popovic said that it would be very difficult to find a replacement for Papagos.<note

                formed a new government in Greece in October following the death of Prime Minister

              merchants was terrible and that the Turks had been too late in their apologies.<note

            <p>The Secretary then referred to the proposed sale of arms by Russia to Egypt which
              disturbed him greatly. He was particularly concerned that the Israelis might attack
              Egypt before the sale was consummated. He said that the United States had always tried
              to maintain a balance from a military point of view between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Popovic replied that his government had listened to <persName>Dulles</persName>’
              August proposal with great interest and that they heartily approved this plan which
              did not depend upon a balance of arms.<note n="4" xml:id="d257fn4">Reference is to the

            <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0700"/>
            <p>The Secretary said he had been particularly encouraged that his proposal had not been
              rejected by either side. He said that in his speech at the General Assembly this
              morning <persName corresp="#p_FM1">Fawzi</persName> (Egypt)<note n="5"

              Secretary’s proposal.</p>
            <p>Popovic agreed and again warmly referred to this “courageous offer” of the United
              States.</p>

                >Economic Counselor, Yugoslav Secretariat of State for Economic
                Affairs.</note><persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> and Milovanovic. At my
              suggestion Tempo launched into presentation Yugoslav economic position along lines
              very similar to other recent expositions. In listing economic problems, he first noted
              hard terms of inescapably recurring short-term debts for raw materials and then went
              on to outline medium term debt repayment difficulties. Next topic was investment
              program total of which had to be curtailed while remaining amounts were redirected
              into agriculture at first priority with metallurgical development as low second.
              Current trading pattern led to chronic annual dollar deficit, particularly for wheat,
              coke, petroleum and certain rolled steel products. Hand to mouth status of material
              reserves was also major problem since it made health of economy subject minute
              fluctuations in supply situation.</p>

            <p>Tempo pointed to regime’s plans solve difficulties and explained how Soviet economic
              agreement helps Yugoslavs.<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">Telegram 549 from Moscow,
                September 2, contained a summary of the Yugoslav-Soviet economic negotiations which
                took place August 23–September 1 and of the agreement reached at the end of the
                discussions. (Department of State, Central Files, 661.68/9–255)</note> Hard currency
              and a gold loan may be used to redeem gold now being held by <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                >IMF</gloss> and/or <gloss target="#t_BIS1">BIS</gloss>, thereby saving interest
              charges. He expressed hope approaches to Western creditors will (after bilateral
              talks) result in rescheduling present medium term debts to long term basis. Expanded
              Soviet trade will reduce dollar import needs (cotton, petroleum, coke) but not
              displace dollar exports significantly except for 6,000 tons lead annual. Soviet three
              year $54 million credit will help finance this increased trade and contribute to
              liquidation of short term debt now used for new material purchases. Soviet investment
              credits (fertilizer plants, etc.) will then fit perfectly into new Yugoslav emphasis
              on boosting agriculture.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless Soviet assistance is neither wholly adequate nor satisfactory re terms.
              Although Russians seemed hold out offer of wheat, purchase from Soviets would upset
              balance of payments plans or tie up $54 million credit needed for other items.
              Moreover Yugoslavia will need about 500,000 tons wheat annually next 3 to 5 years. It
              hoped for US grant of 700,000 to 800,000 tons <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956
              and then it might be able cover needs later years void US commodity loan. In any event
              speedy decision was necessary since only two months supply now on hand and purchases
              from peasants moving slowly. Yugoslavs recognized essentiality of increased exports
              (possible Majdanpek and other non-ferrous mining and mineral processing loans aimed at
              this, as did “austerity” cutback in new industrial investments to increase items
              available for export and new attention to agriculture so as reduce food import costs
              for rapidly growing population), but this was longer term issue not affecting current
              wheat problem.</p>
            <p>I explained to Tempo that we viewed problems sympathetically from unchanged friendly
              position towards Yugoslavia. Yet we had number of unresolved questions with Yugoslavs
              in economic, political and military fields. Latter issues seemed simple, and, since
              they had been worked out between US and all other countries involved in <gloss
                target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> programs, I was optimistic on results here. I had
              come however to review all these things, and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> had urged me see Yugoslav officials concerned to work out
              difficulties. I was to see Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_GGI1"
                >Gosnjak</persName> next day and could address myself to Tempo’s needs better after
              I assessed military picture because many Congressmen viewed all kinds of aid together
              and also wanted to know where <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0704"/>Yugoslavia was
              heading. I was personally hopeful that we could help Yugoslavs on economic matters but
              this would have to await second meeting with Tempo later.</p>
            <p>Tempo responded with reiteration position on Battle Act (no intention violate since
              that would be political gesture) and then declared with some emotion that friendship
              with US permanent whether future aid given or not because past generous aid had made
              present Yugoslav position possible. Our feeling is that Tempo was both frank and
              friendly and that trip to Moscow may have eliminated certain illusions about relations
              with Soviets.</p>
            <p>My approach was intended as bargaining tactic to give Yugoslavs impression I intend
              associate economic with military aid although I have not categorically made granting
              of one depend on other. I feel meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GGI1"
                >Gosnjak</persName> today may well be key to whether this tactic will bear fruit. If
                <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Gosnjak</persName> sticks to hard line on military
              problems, we shall have to weigh line most carefully before revisiting Tempo since

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I appreciate highly your message
              delivered to me by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName> during his
              visit to Beograd.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2"><ref target="#d256">Document
                256</ref>.</note> I was very pleased to find expressed in your letter the same
              concern and aspirations we feel regarding the preservation and security of peace, the
              creation of better living conditions and international cooperation, and especially
              regarding the necessity of permanent friendly collaboration between the United States
              of America and Yugoslavia.</p>
            <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0705"/>
            <p>I am certain that the same spirit of tolerance and understanding to which you, Mr.
              President, contributed so much at the Geneva Conference, and which gave release and so
              many hopes to worried mankind, will prevail at the next Conference of the Four Foreign
              Ministers. None of us expects that all, or even the majority, of the most important
              controversial international problems will be solved at that meeting, but any new
              progress will mean a great deal for further easing of tension in the world and for the
              creation of confidence in the possibility of peaceful settlement among states.</p>
            <p>It is a great satisfaction to me to be able to say that I and my associates had
              friendly and successful talks, and exchanged points of view, with Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> about all the problems that concern our two
              countries. It was apparent on both sides that no change of any significance in foreign
              policy and in our relations had taken place. Yugoslavia is firmly resolved to continue
              pursuing a policy of principle, a policy of friendly collaboration with the United
              States of America, and the other countries in the West and throughout the world. I can
              assure you that we value above all the independence we won through such tremendous
              efforts and sacrifices.</p>
            <p>The process of normalization of our relations with the Soviet Union and the other
              Eastern countries is unfolding on a basis of equality and respect for independence and
              sovereignty. The process is not developing uniformly or with equal success with all
              these countries, but rather on an individual basis and in conformity with mutual
              respect for one another’s interests. Let me assure you that the normalization of these
              relations, no matter how successfully it may proceed, in our opinion cannot and should
              not take place at the expense of our relations with the Western countries. For, if
              that were so, we would not achieve what we desire most: the preservation of peace and
              pacific friendly coexistence and cooperation among states and peoples.</p>
            <p>I know that recently there have been in the West certain unjustified doubts regarding
              Yugoslavia’s intentions. In such a case, it is important to have an exchange of views
              at the highest level, as was the case now, because that is the easiest way to
              eliminate misunderstandings. I entirely agree with you, Mr. President, that we do not
              always follow the same road on matters of foreign policy, but I am confident that
              there will be no differences of opinion between us regarding the most important
              questions relating to peace or war. In addition to this, there are still many other
              problems of an international nature towards which we have similar attitudes and
              regarding which the possibility for profitable cooperation exists.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I should like to thank you for your efforts and your assistance in
              bringing these talks to such a successful close.</p>
            <p>May I wish you a speedy and complete recovery.</p>

                that <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would use this memorandum “as a

                President on October 11 at Fitzsimmons Hospital in Denver. In his memorandum of
                their conversation, dated October 11, <persName>Dulles</persName> noted: “I said
                that Bob <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had come back from Belgrade
                and had had a most successful visit with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> and his principal aides. I thought that he had pretty well
                cleared up the concrete points of friction between us. The President said he was
                happy with this result. He said he had a high regard for <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                  >Murphy</persName> and his ability to deal with problems of this kind. I said that
                  <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had brought back a letter from
                  <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to him (the President) which I was
                leaving with <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Sherman Adams</persName>, together with a
                draft of a possible reply, both of which the President would want to consider at his
                convenience. There was no rush about the matter.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles

            <p>Remembering our conversation of August 11,<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">See <ref

            <p>As far as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is concerned personally,
                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> found that his attitude on the subject
              of continuing cooperation with the United States was more clearly expressed than at
              the time of the Trieste negotiations. In reply to your letter, <persName

              which he is now undergoing a cure.</p>
            <p>The difficulties which prevailed between our personnel in Yugoslavia and the local
              military authorities on the subject of our military aid program have been resolved.
              The Country Team, the European Command, and the Defense Department are agreed on the
              resumption of deliveries of military equipment. There will be deliveries of a few
              items which have been delayed and which are immediately available. At the same time,
              the entire program is being reexamined <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0707"/>in the
              belief that we can affect substantial economies without interfering with our political
              objectives in the area.</p>
            <p>We have resumed our negotiations with the Yugoslavs regarding economic aid which they
              urgently need and want. It is <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s opinion
              that recent Yugoslav negotiations with the USSR on the subject of economic cooperation
              have carried with them a certain disillusionment for the Yugoslavs and a better
              appreciation on their part of the manner in which we have extended economic aid to
              them. We ourselves should have no illusions regarding the possibility that the future
              may bring more intensive relations between the Party apparatus in Yugoslavia and that
              of the USSR. It is our belief that the <gloss target="#t_Cominform1">Cominform</gloss>
              type of international communism, at least as far as Yugoslavia is concerned, is
              finished.</p>

              participate in the discussions proceed to a small island about a half-mile away, where
              the talks would take place. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              escorted the Secretary into a speedboat and took the wheel himself, driving the
              Secretary to the island. The other members of the party followed in other craft. After
              making a brief tour of the small island, the meeting began at a table in the open air
              outside a replica of a small Burmese temple which President <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had constructed after his visit to Burma.<note
                n="2" xml:id="d263fn2"><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> visited Burma
                January 6–7, 1955.</note> This structure was attractively arranged inside with
              tables, serving counter, kitchen, etc., obviously for informal entertaining.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> opened the conversation by
              saying he would like to know what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                >Dulles</persName> would be interested in discussing in order to put to the best
              possible use the limited time at their disposal. He said if Secretary <persName
                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would agree to spend the night, they would have
              a long discussion which would fully exhaust all topics of mutual interest. The
              Secretary replied that he was afraid this was not possible since he had to return to
              Geneva. This need not, he said, cause them to rush through their discussion, as he
              could spend the entire afternoon there leaving at any time that might be convenient
              that evening. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> expressed
              pleasure and asked the Secretary if he and his party would remain for dinner. He said
              they could have an early dinner. This would provide more time for their discussions
              and would also enable the Secretary to get back to Geneva that night. The Secretary
              accepted with pleasure and it was agreed that dinner would take place at 6:30 p.m.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> then said he was ready to hear
              what topics Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> wished to propose
              that they discuss. The Secretary replied suggesting that they talk about: <list>

            <p>The Secretary said if this was agreeable, he would start by outlining the present

            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> opened the discussion about
              the Geneva Conference by stating that it had been agreed with the Soviets that three
              topics would be discussed at Geneva: (1) European Security and German Reunification;
              (2) Disarmament; (3) Contacts between East and West.</p>
            <p>Thus far, except for one day devoted to a general discussion of East-West Contacts,
              the time of the Conference has been entirely spent on the discussion of European
              Security and Germany.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that with respect to European Security, the ideas of the West and
              those of the Soviets were somewhat the same in that both the Western and the Soviet
              proposals provided that there could be a European Security pact embracing a number of
              states in the middle of Europe. At Geneva there had not been discussion of what
              specific states would be parties to such a pact, but the Western powers had in mind
              Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and of
              course the Soviet Union. Also, both the proposals put forward by the two sides would
              provide for mutual pledges on the non-use of force; on the denial of assistance to
              aggressors; and to provide aid to a victim of aggression.</p>
            <p>The proposals would further provide for a zone, the area of which had not been
              discussed in precise terms at Geneva, between East and West which the Western powers
              envisaged would embrace most of Germany and parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia. There
              would be agreed levels of forces in such a zone, with reciprocal inspection rights so
              that each side could verify that the agreed level of forces was not being
              exceeded.</p>
            <p>On all the foregoing principles there seemed to be a basis for general agreement.
              However, if these principles were ever discussed in detail, there would doubtless be
              difficult problems which would have to be discussed at length and negotiated.</p>
            <p>The Secretary mentioned that the Western proposal also provided for overlapping radar
              establishments, perhaps 100–150 miles on each side of the line of demarcation. We
              believed the overlapping radar arrangement would tend largely to reduce the
              possibility of surprise attack. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              asked if the radar arrangement would operate on both sides of the line of demarcation
              or just on the Western side, and the Secretary replied that it would operate on both
                <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0711"/>sides, and he drew a rough map to explain
              the operation as we envisaged it. He added that the Soviets had not accepted this
              suggestion.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then said the proposals of the Western powers with respect to European
              Security were made on the assumption that Germany was to be unified, but not that it
              would necessarily join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, since the Western
              proposals specifically provide that Germany would have freedom of choice. It could
              join the Western collective security arrangement, it could join the Eastern
              arrangement under the Warsaw Pact, or it might not join either. The Secretary said
              that <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, in the discussions at the
              Conference, kept insisting that the Western proposal was predicated on a united
              Germany joining <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and that a united Germany would
              do so. The Secretary emphasized that while the Western proposal did not force a united
              Germany to join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we thought it might do so.
              However, it would be juridically a new state, free, as he had said previously, to join
              with the East, the West, or neither.</p>
            <p>He went on to explain to President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> that
              the security pressures which we would be willing to include in a European Security
              treaty would be stronger if Germany were in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              because we would be able to control a united Germany in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> through the Brussels Pact and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
              arrangements. He explained that the Brussels Treaty<note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4">Treaty
                of Economic, Social, and Cultural Collaboration and Collective Self-Defense among
                the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg was signed on March 17, 1948.
                For text of the treaty, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Basic
                  Documents, 1950–1955,</hi> vol. I, pp. 968–971.</note> forbade German production
              of bacteriological, chemical, and nuclear weapons; that it limits German forces to 12
              divisions; and similarly limits the type of naval craft which Germany could have; that
              it provides for limitations on stocks of ammunition so that they would not have more
              than needed by the agreed level of German forces. Furthermore, the Western system
              provided for the integration of German forces so that Germany would not control the
              logistical support for German forces, and if Germany became intransigent or wished to
              use its forces separately, <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> could cut off
              their fuel and petrol supply so that German aircraft and tanks could not move. The
              Secretary said we thought these controls were extremely effective. If Germany were
              left alone in the middle of Europe in a totally independent status to bargain between
              East and West, a most dangerous situation would be created. He reiterated that while
              we would hope a united Germany would stay under the controls of the Brussels Treaty
              and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, that was for the Germans to decide.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then went on to say that the Soviets at Geneva were unwilling to
              contemplate any steps at all looking to German reunification. He believed the Soviets
              felt that German reunification <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0712"/>would result
              in the liquidation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would have a bad
              effect on the Soviet hold on the other satellite states of Eastern Europe. He said
              this had been his diagnosis of the Soviet position at the Summit Conference at Geneva
              in July, and all the evidence supported this estimate. In other words, the Soviet
              opposition to reunification of Germany was not based on considerations of Soviet
              military security, because the West could meet any such apprehensions. It was based on
              the possible political effect on the satellites and also that the <gloss
                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was unpopular in East Germany and would disappear if
              there were free popular expression. The unpopularity of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                >GDR</gloss> was clearly indicated by the fact that more refugees than ever were
              trying to move from East to West Germany. In the light of this situation, the Soviets
              feared that reunification of Germany by free elections would result in the sweeping
              away of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then said the United States took a very serious view of Soviet
              opposition to German reunification for two reasons: <list>
                <label>1.</label>
                <item>It was specifically agreed by the Heads of Government at the Summit Conference
                  in their Directive to the Foreign Ministers<note n="5" xml:id="d263fn5">For text
                    of the Directive to the Foreign Ministers, July 23, 1955, see <ref

                  reunified. Failure of the Soviets to live up to this agreement would have a very
                  bad effect on the so-called Spirit of Geneva, and would lead people in the United
                  States and elsewhere to become convinced that the Soviets did not live up to
                  agreements which they made.</item>
                <label>2.</label>
                <item>The continued division of Germany could lead to a revival of fanatical German
                  nationalism whose aim would be to reunite Germany by any means.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p rend="flushleft">The Secretary explained that he had been at the Versailles Treaty
              Conference and had also been in Europe in the 1920’s. He had seen the situation evolve
              which led to the rise of Hitler to power. He pointed out that for seven or eight years
              following the Versailles Treaty, Germany had had moderate liberal governments which
              was peacefully minded. But, gradually the injustices of Versailles with respect to the
              Rhineland, reparations, etc., had led to the rise of national fanaticism in Germany.
              We believed, the Secretary said, that if we kept postponing German reunification, it
              would be ever harder to achieve, and would lead to a revival of this German
              nationalism. In this connection, the recent Saar elections had shown some rather
              disquieting signs. He said that if we postponed reunification too long, German
              nationalism would become a real force—not in two or three years, but in four or five
              years’ time. We were therefore pressing the Soviet Union hard for German
              reunification, but thus far there were no signs from the Soviet Delegation in Geneva
              that any forward steps would be taken.</p>
            <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0713"/>
            <p>The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had returned to
              Moscow over the week end rather unexpectedly, and it was barely possible, but not
              probable, that he might return with new instructions. In this connection, the
              Secretary mentioned that after the Summit meeting <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had spent
              three days at Berlin to assure the Pankow Government<note n="6" xml:id="d263fn6">The
                Government of the German Democratic Republic.</note> that it would not be
              liquidated. The Soviets probably felt that a liquidation of the Pankow Government
              would immediately weaken the governments in Poland and Czechoslovakia, thus creating a
              serious situation. The Secretary concluded by saying he would very much appreciate
              President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s views on the problem.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied that he had followed
              closely the Geneva Conference and had also read the Secretary’s last speech made on
                Friday.<note n="7" xml:id="d263fn7"><persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement of
                November 4 is printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                November 21, 1955, p. 823.</note> He went on to say that the Yugoslav ideas with
              respect to the German question had been developed before the <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> visit to Belgrade. These views and the reasons for them had
              been explained by the Yugoslavs to a number of people including the Soviets during the
                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> visit. Yugoslavia had always maintained that Germany must be
              independent and this included the right to rearm to a certain extent. A sovereign
              Germany must be re-created.</p>
            <p>The Secretary asked whether President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              meant a reunified and sovereign Germany. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              replied that he had not precisely stated this, but that Yugoslav thinking presupposed
              that Germany must be united because both the West Germans and East Germans desired
              unity. However, in view of the attitude of the Soviet Union and the attitude of the
              Western powers on the German question, the Yugoslavs realized that German
              reunification would be a slow and gradual process. At the same time, the Yugoslavs
              believed that both parts of Germany must take part in the process of
              reunification.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> emphasized again that the Yugoslav views
              to the above effect were developed before he met with the Soviets during the visit of
              the latter to Belgrade, and he wished to stress to the Secretary that they were the
              independent views of the Yugoslav Government and had not been influenced by the Soviet
              visit. He added that he and his associates had also spoken along the above lines to
              Herr Gerstenmeier and other members of a West German parliamentary delegation which
              had visited Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> continued that he and his
              collaborators had the impression in their talks with the Soviets that “they would
              never accept the elimination of East Germany”. (At this point, <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> interrupted <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686"
                facs="0714"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VDJ1">Vilfan</persName> who was interpreting,
              to say that his remarks had not been correctly translated. What he had said was that
              the Yugoslavs had the strong impression from the Soviets that East Germany must play
              an integral role in the gradual reunification of Germany.) Therefore, the problem was
              to find a way to bring together both Germanies and to form a reunified Germany which
              was neither militaristic nor expansionist. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> said that of course he could not guess what the ultimate aim of the
              Soviets toward Germany was, but it was clear that the Soviet Union feared a revived
              military and expansionist united Germany.</p>
            <p>The Secretary interrupted to say that we all would fear such a Germany. <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that if we looked at the problem more
              closely, it was clear that there was no danger of East Germany swallowing West
              Germany. East Germany was much smaller and there were substantial non-Communist
              elements in the East zone. There was, he said, no danger of a “Lublin solution”<note
                n="8" xml:id="d263fn8">Reference is to the formation in July 1944 of a government in
                Poland composed primarily of pro-Soviet Polish politicians. The government was
                immediately recognized by the Soviet Union. The United States did not extend
                recognition until July 1945, and then only after the government was expanded to
                include pro-Western Poles. Following elections in January 1947, the pro-Soviet
                elements gained complete control of the government.</note> such as befell the Poles.
              He then went on to say that he wished to speak very frankly about this matter. If we
              were to speak of the danger of a rebirth of German imperialism, we must analyze this
              danger. We must look into the elements which would cause a rebirth of imperialism. He
              said he agreed with the Secretary that the possibility of a revival of German
              nationalism was a danger, but it was only one of the dangers. He said he also
              understood the plan to keep Germany under control through <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                >NATO</gloss> but asked who could be sure of the German role when it was reunited.
              They might follow a course of their own choosing. The Germans, he said, had always
              criticized themselves for fighting on two fronts. The best object lesson in this
              respect was the Hitler-Stalin deal. Therefore, nobody could prophesy completely
              accurately what course a reunited Germany would follow, nor could we forget the
              reasons why Germany started the last war. It was essential that we have a Germany
              which was not expansionist but which was a useful member of the international
              community. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said the Western powers would
              not find a solution when the four Foreign Ministers met again. But, it was imperative
              that the West keep looking for a viable solution.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> went on to say that although
              European Security was not identic with the German problem, they were linked. He
              suggested that if a solution to the problem of European Security could be found, this
              would aid a solution to the German problem. To be <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687"
                facs="0715"/>quite frank, he said, the United States was afraid of Soviet
              expansionism and aggression. The Yugoslavs had had similar fears and they were still
              cautious. But, because the United States feared Russian aggression, it should not
              forget the possibility of future German aggression. We must constantly think of both
              dangers, for if we think of only one we promote the other.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said we were well aware of this, and France, which had the best reasons
              to fear German aggression, was always present in our councils. The Secretary said he
              agreed with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> that reunification would
              probably only come about gradually, but it would never come about unless we made a
              beginning. As matters now stood, the German problem was becoming solidified, and
              therefore, more difficult of solution. He mentioned the proposal the three Western
              powers put forward last Friday looking to elections in Germany in September 1956.<note
                n="9" xml:id="d263fn9">The text of the Tripartite proposal, November 4, 1955,
                concerning the reunification of Germany by free elections, is printed in <hi
                  rend="italic">Documents</hi> (R.I.I.A.) for 1955, p. 55.</note> He said we did not
              expect elections to be held next September, but that the Western proposal might
              provoke some constructive response from the Soviets. He said the great danger was that
              German reunification would be so long delayed that it would come about not as a result
              of action by the four powers but by violent German action. This was the course Hitler
              had followed by strong and violent action in re-occupying the Rhineland.</p>
            <p>The Secretary reiterated that reunification should be brought about by action of the
              four powers and that it should not be so delayed that the Germans would be tempted to
              take matters into their own hands. While German reunification would not come about
              next year, it was of vital importance that it come about in the next several years as
              the situation would not hold indefinitely.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. The Middle East.</hi></p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> opened the discussion on the
              Middle East by saying that the Yugos were following this problem very closely. On his
              return trip from Burma and India, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had
              stopped in Cairo to pay a visit on Col. <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1"
                >Nasser</persName>. One purpose of his visit was to suggest that some direct contact
              be established between Israel and Egypt; but when he had mentioned this, all the
              Egyptians had started to talk at once protesting most vigorously. President <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that the idea of getting the Israelis and
              Egyptians together did not have to be abandoned but now, in the light of the
              development of events, this was unfortunately more difficult. President <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> then said that, speaking frankly, the Yugos
              believed that one of the most unhappy ideas which had been injected into the Middle
              East was the formulation of military pacts in that area which tended to divide the
              Arab world. <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0716"/>Those pacts, instead of being
              elements or security, are in fact an element of weakness. The Secretary interrupted to
              inquire whether President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had reference
              to the Baghdad Pact. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied in the
              affirmative saying that as long as only Turkey and Pakistan were involved in an
              alliance, the situation in the Middle East was not substantially changed, but when
              Iraq and then Iran were added, the situation was entirely different. The Baghdad Pact
              had threatened the unity of the Arab League and some states had joined the Baghdad
              Pact and others had stayed out and tried to form another Pact.</p>
            <p>Turning to the Arab refugee problem, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              said that this poisoned relations between the Arab states and Israel. <persName
                corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName> had spoken to him in Cairo about it at length.
              President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> thought the great powers must
              try to help the Arabs economically with a view to assisting in the solution of this
              problem. He then said the great powers should also speak to the Israelis very firmly
              and frankly and tell them that their actions had been extremely unhelpful. We should
              all stress to the Arabs that the State of Israel has become a fact of life and that
              this must be recognized by them. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> said that in his forthcoming visit to Cairo in December he would
              make this point with <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName>. He continued
              that if we did not find a solution to the Arab-Israel problem, there is a risk of
              great danger. Yugoslavia is intensely interested in the Near Eastern area and if a
              solution is not found to the Arab-Israel problem, there is a real danger of a war. In
              this connection, he said he must state frankly that the Israeli leaders are not
              following the best policy. They are, in fact, risking war and a preventive war which
              would solve nothing and cost them dearly.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that we consider the situation in the area extremely serious.
              Whether the origin of the present tension goes back to the Baghdad Pact was debatable
              and could be argued. However, the immediate cause of the present trouble was the
              Egyptian arms deal engineered by the Soviet Union.<note n="10" xml:id="d263fn10">On
                September 27, 1955, <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName> announced an
                agreement signed on September 21, allowing for the Egyptian purchase of arms from
                Czechoslovakia. For documentation, see <ref target="frus1955-57v14">volume
                XIV</ref>.</note> (President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              interrupted to say that the deal was with Czechoslovakia to which the Secretary
              replied that it had been conceived and engineered by the Russians.) The Secretary
              continued saying the Western powers had been trying to work out a solution by limiting
              the arms which go to each side and thus to keep a balance—while, at the same time,
              pressing both sides vigorously for a settlement. The Secretary had made a speech last
              August 26<note n="11" xml:id="d263fn11">For text of the Secretary’s speech before the
                Council on Foreign Relations, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                >Tito</persName> said he had read it) proposing a general approach <pb n="689"
                xml:id="pg_689" facs="0717"/>to solution and offering funds to Israel to assist in
              an Arab refugee settlement and also funds for the Jordan water project. Turning to the
              question of the Arab refugee problem, the Secretary said that while the Arabs talk a
              great deal about this problem, not many of them are very willing to do anything about
              it. Probably the Arabs like to point to the bad conditions in the refugee camps which
              the Secretary had seen at first hand in his visit to the area in 1953 as proof of how
              terrible the Israelis are.</p>
            <p>With respect to a settlement of the Arab-Israel problem the Secretary felt strongly
              that there should be a settlement of the boundaries. He had hoped that perhaps by
              intermediaries negotiations might be brought about leading to a boundary settlement.
              While we were studying this possibility, the Egyptian arms deal had been effected. The
              U.S. did not question the right of the Soviet bloc to sell arms or the Egyptians right
              to receive them. But the results of the arms deal were inevitable and the consequences
              were easily foreseeable. The deal had made the Israelis, with a population of only 1½
              million against 20 million Egyptians plus the populations of Syria and Saudi Arabia,
              feel that they must strike first before Egypt had assimilated the arms and could use
              them to bring about the destruction of Israel. While <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1"
                >Nasser</persName> did not talk about annihilating Israel, Ibn Saud had done so
              continuously as was the present Saudi King. The Secretary mentioned his talks with
              Israeli Foreign Minister Sharett<note n="12" xml:id="d263fn12">Secretary <persName
                  corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett met in
                Paris on October 26, and again in Geneva on October 30. See <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v14#pg_657">vol. XIV, pp. 657</ref> and <ref
                  target="frus1955-57v14#pg_683">683</ref>.</note> and said that Israel wanted
              equivalent arms to balance the Czechoslovak shipment. We were not inclined to provide
              arms in quantity since it would simply lead to an arms race. Israel also wanted a
              guarantee of its territory but we were not disposed to give it guarantee because there
              was no satisfactory boundary settlement. The Israeli position is that if we cannot
              give them arms, or a territorial guarantee, they must do something themselves for
              their preservation.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said we had also called the attention of the Soviets on three occasions
              to the danger of war breaking out in the area as a result of the arms shipment. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> last week in Geneva had said to the
              Secretary that there was no danger as a result of the arms shipments. <persName
                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had even showed him a clipping attributing to
                <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">General Burns</persName><note n="13"
                xml:id="d263fn13">Major General <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">E.L.M.
                  Burns</persName>, Commander, U.N. Truce Supervisory Organization in
                Palestine.</note> the statement that there was no danger. This did not correspond
              with the fact because <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">General Burns</persName> believed
              and said there was great danger. Although <persName corresp="#p_BMGELM1">General
                Burns</persName> might have made a statement playing down the danger, precisely so
              that it would not become aggravated, his views in this matter were <pb n="690"
                xml:id="pg_690" facs="0718"/>quite clear. The present situation was that each side
              felt the situation was more dangerous and more tense and there was great risk that
              hostilities would begin without anyone being able clearly to identify which side had
              been responsible for the aggression. The best solution would be for each side to pull
              back their forces so that an aggressor could be readily identified. This, in itself,
              would provide a deterrent.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then said that he did not believe that Egypt would become a Soviet
              satellite simply because of the Czech arms deal. But there was danger that Egypt would
              become more dependent on the Soviet Union particularly for spare parts, etc. The U.S.
              is prepared to assume that Egypt will remain independent of the Soviet Union; and,
              therefore, we do not wish to take reprisals, such as cutting off aid or putting
              pressure on the International Bank to refuse a loan for the High Dam just because
              Egypt concluded the deal. The U.S. does not wish to get placed in the position of
              backing Israel with the Soviets backing the Arab states. While Jewish elements in the
              U.S. have considerable influence, they do not make U.S. foreign policy and we believe
              that everyone should counsel moderation and avoid a position where the U.S. and the
              Soviet Union would be backing the opposing camps. The Secretary said he agreed with
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> that the Arabs must accept Israel as a
              fact of life. Furthermore, we should all concentrate on solutions to the refugee
              problem, the water problem, and particularly the boundary problem. The Secretary was
              inclined to believe that Israel would accept a settlement even though it had to make
              some sacrifices, but the Arabs refused to deal directly with Israel. If anything is to
              be accomplished, it may have to be done on the side through intermediaries, but we are
              not even sure if that is possible. The big territorial problem for Egypt is Negev
              where Egypt wants land access to Jordan. Israel wants to retain the Negev for prestige
              reasons and also because it does not wish to be cut off from the port of Akaba. The
              Arab states sometimes talk about<note n="14" xml:id="d263fn14">In a change presumably
                ordered by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the source text

              1947 but this Resolution gave all the Negev to Israel which would not seem to satisfy
              Egypt. We still believe that some settlement could be arranged; but in view of the
              unwillingness of the parties to get together, it is extremely difficult. The Secretary
              said we had thought of a Trieste type of negotiation<note n="15" xml:id="d263fn15">In
                a change presumably ordered by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                “negotiation” substituted.</note> where a proposed solution would be presented to
              both sides and inquired whether President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              would be willing to take this one on. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              laughed, indicating that others might be better placed than he.</p>
            <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0719"/>
            <p>The Secretary then asked President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> if he
              had good relations with both Arab states and Israel. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> replied in the affirmative saying that he had been invited to
              Israel last year but he had been unable to go. The Secretary asked him if he would go
              this year when he visited Egypt and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              replied in the negative, but that he might go next year. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> said that he would try to help with both sides and reiterated that
              he would be frank with <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName> when he saw him
              in December and that when he next visited Israel he would also be equally frank there.
              Yugoslavia’s only real interest is the maintenance of peace in the area. The
              conversation on the Middle East concluded with the Secretary saying that he personally
              thought well of Col. <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName> in that he was
              honest and well-intentioned, but that he was fanatical on the problem of Israel.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Communist China.</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary opened the discussion of this item by saying he would appreciate having
              President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s views about China since
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> knew much more about it than did we.
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied that he could not agree that he
              knew much more than the Secretary but he would be glad to give his views. He said the
              Yugoslavs had not known too much about China, but since they had established
              diplomatic relations with the Chinese Communist regime<note n="16" xml:id="d263fn16"
                >Yugoslavia established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China in
                January 1955.</note> they were in a position to give first-hand study to it.</p>
            <p>The first point he wished to make was that one could not speak of China as a
              satellite of the Soviet Union. It was true that at one time the Soviets had had great
              influence over the Chinese Communists, but even during the time when <persName
                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName><note n="17" xml:id="d263fn17"><persName
                  corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>, Chairman of the People’s Republic of
                China.</note> was trying to come to power during the “partisan” war period, Stalin
              had complained that <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> was very hard to deal
              with. The Soviets, he felt, had a rather cautious attitude toward the Chinese
              Communists. China was a very large country, with infinitely greater population than
              the Soviet Union. The Soviets were helping China economically and technically, but it
              was wrong to think the Soviets were pushing Communist China as their spearhead for
              penetration in Asia.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said he was sure that some
              times the Soviet exercised a restraining influence on the Chinese Communists, and in
              this connection commented that the Chinese Communist regime was young and in full
              flush of revolutionary fever, which on occasions caused it “to run a bit wild”. He
              felt that the Chinese Communists had learned some lessons and were now wiser than they
              had been initially. He expressed the view that it would be very helpful if <pb n="692"
                xml:id="pg_692" facs="0720"/>Communist China could be admitted to the UN since it
              was important for them to have political and economic contacts with a wide variety of
              countries and not to be forced into a position of only having relations with the
              Soviet Union. He stressed the political importance of this and commented that with
              respect to the economic side, China could provide a wide market for a number of
              countries, including the United States. He then went on to say that just as China had
              “shown some elasticity in its internal affairs, so it might show similar elasticity in
              its foreign policy, which would not exclude some difficulties with the Soviet
              Union”.</p>
            <p>The Secretary inquired whether there was a relationship between the Chinese and the
              Soviet Communist Parties. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied in the
              affirmative but said the Chinese Communist Party was quite independent. There had been
              certain pro-Russian elements in the Chinese Communist Party but they had been largely
              eliminated. He summarized by saying that the relations between the two Parties were
              equivalent to the relations between the Soviet Union and China.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said he understood President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> to make the point that there was not the same relationship between
              Communist China and the Soviet Union as between the Soviet Union and the European
              satellites which it dominated. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said the
              Secretary’s understanding was correct, and started to speak of a weakening of ties
              between the Soviet Union and its European satellites, but agreed that this would be
              discussed later when they exchanged views on the satellite countries.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then asked President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              whether he felt his information regarding the relationship between China and the
              Soviet Union was dependable. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied in
              the affirmative, adding that it was not necessary for the Yugoslavs to rely simply on
              information which came to them. Their estimate was based to a large extent on their
              understanding of the political developments in China which in some respects were close
              to the past developments of Communism in Yugoslavia. He added that the conclusions
              which the Yugoslavs had reached from their analysis corresponded with views they had
              received from the Burmese and Indians during <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s trip to Burma and India.</p>
            <p>At this point, <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> interrupted to say that
              the Yugoslavs knew quite a bit about the misunderstanding between Stalin and <persName
                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>. He said they knew from what Stalin had
              told them that Stalin was opposed to <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> taking
              over China by open revolution. He said it was a paradox that two Communist revolutions
              which were completely successful—namely, the Yugoslav and the Chinese—were carried out
              against Stalin’s wishes. Stalin had wanted all countries that engaged in revolution to
              be dependent on the <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0721"/>Soviet Union because he
              was fully aware that every revolution bred a feeling of national independence.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that in the United States there was a strong feeling against the
              Chinese Communists. This sentiment derived largely from Chinese Communist intervention
              in Korea and also from the open efforts of the Chinese to take over Indochina which
              seriously threatened that area. He now believed the situation in South Vietnam, Laos,
              and Cambodia was such that those areas had a good prospect of remaining free. Another
              cause for United States sentiment against Communist China was their threats of action
              against Taiwan, which had not been part of China for sixty years. Taiwan had been
              detached from Japan largely due to the efforts of the United States, and therefore the
              United States did not feel obliged to turn Taiwan back to a regime which was hostile
              to the United States. Similarly, we did not like the continuous threats of the use of
              force against Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Secretary then briefly outlined Ambassador Johnson’s talks with Ambassador Wang
              in Geneva,<note n="18" xml:id="d263fn18">Reference is to the Geneva Ambassadorial
                talks held from August 1955 through 1957 between <persName>U. Alexis
                  Johnson</persName>, U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, and Wang Pingnan,
                Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China to Poland.</note> saying that our first
              objective was to secure the release of Americans who had been imprisoned for political
              reasons. These Americans were gradually being released. The Chinese Communists wished
              to talk about trade and we were willing to have some talk on this subject, but we
              wished to have the Chinese Communists renounce the use of force. The Secretary said
              that if satisfactory progress could be made by the two Ambassadors in Geneva with
              respect to a reasonably dependable renunciation of force, we would all be much better
              off. He said, however, that this would take time and that sentiment in the United
              States could not be changed by arbitrary action on the part of the United States
              Government. A change of sentiments would depend on the actions and words of the
              Chinese Communists. He felt that the talks in Geneva between the Ambassadors were a
              good thing but that they would take time to arrive at the result for which we hoped.
              Therefore, he was not too disturbed at their leisurely pace.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that another aspect of the problem was the loyalty which we felt
              to our Chinese Nationalist friends. He recalled that he had been in Canton in 1938
              when the Japs were moving into China and that Chiang had received an attractive offer
              from the Japanese which he had refused. He had been loyal to the same principles in
              which we believed and we did not feel we could simply abandon him. In connection with
              the Taiwan situation, the Secretary explained that we had obtained an agreement from
              Chiang not to act <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0722"/>against the Mainland except
              in agreement with us. This gave us a considerable degree of control over Chinese
              Nationalist action against the Mainland. Last January the risk of war had been very
              great because of the attitude of the Chinese Communists. In this connection, he
              recalled to President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> that the Congress
              had passed a Resolution<note n="19" xml:id="d263fn19">The Joint Congressional
                Resolution of January 29, 1955.</note> with only six votes in opposition, empowering
              the President to use the armed forces of the United States to assist in the defense of
              Taiwan and the Pescadores. Since then, the situation had improved, but the Chinese
              Communists must realize that the American people still harbored strong feelings
              against them not simply because they were a Communist regime, for we had good and
              friendly relations with Yugoslavia which was a Communist regime, but because of the
              Chinese intervention in Korea, their efforts to take over Indochina, and their threat
              of force to take over Taiwan.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. The Balkan Alliance.</hi></p>
            <p>At the Secretary’s request, President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              gave his views on the Balkan Pact. He opened by saying that recently there had been a
              change in atmosphere as a result of the Turkish riots against the Greeks. These riots
              occurred when the King of Greece was making a state visit to Belgrade. <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had discussed this matter with the King, and both
              had agreed that it would be desirable not to dramatize this situation, particularly in
              Greece where it had caused much emotion. Pursuant to this agreement, the Yugoslavs had
              instructed their diplomatic representatives to tell both the Greeks and the Turks to
              calm down, and they felt their efforts in this direction had produced certain good
              results. The situation today was much calmer than it had been.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> then turned to a discussion of
              the Pact itself. He said it was not true that the Yugoslavs wished to eliminate the
              military side of the Pact. On the other hand, they did not wish to emphasize it as
              much as in the past because the general situation was now different. (He did not
              specifically say so, but obviously was referring to the relaxation of tension and the
              Spirit of Geneva.) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said the Yugoslavs
              believed it was now necessary to emphasize the political, economic, and cultural sides
              of the Pact. The Turkish action against the Greeks in September had made it quite
              obvious that it was necessary to strengthen the relations in other fields, because the
              military relationship was not of much use unless it had a firmer foundation based on
              real cooperation in other fields.</p>
            <p>With respect to the military aspects, President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> said the Yugoslavs had recently sent a military delegation to
              Greece to discuss military cooperation in areas where they had a common interest. <pb
                n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0723"/>They had not, however, wished to publicize this
              military mission. He felt that despite the Turkish action against the Greeks, the Pact
              would develop into an even more useful instrument.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said the Turkish riots had been a very bad affair. While the Turks were
              primarily responsible, a certain blame was attached to the Greeks because they had set
              in motion the forces of nationalism, particularly with respect to Cyprus, which now
              they were having difficulty in controlling. He said he believed the Turks wished to
              make amends for the riots and hoped the Greeks would accept such gestures and also
              that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> would work toward this end.</p>
            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. European Satellite States.</hi></p>
            <p>The Secretary opened the conversation on this subject by referring to a comment
              President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had made earlier in the
              discussion about a weakening of ties between the Soviets and the satellites.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that in viewing the satellites, one
              had to go back into history. When Stalin had died it was clear that certain
              developments started to occur in the Soviet Union and that two divergent trends had
              appeared. The first trend was simply to continue Stalin’s policy in both the internal
              and external fields. This trend had been quite strong in the Soviet Union, and
              particularly strong in the satellites. The other trend was a realization of the blind
              alley into which Stalin’s policy had led the Soviet Union. He mentioned that <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> held this
              view. They had realized that to get out of the blind alley they must effect a change
              in future policy, including Soviet policy toward the satellites. The first result of
              this change of policy line was the <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                >Bulganin</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit to
              Yugoslavia. This visit was not simply to get Yugoslavia back into the Soviet camp, but
              was recognition that the entire Soviet policy toward Yugoslavia in the preceding four
              years had been wrong. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that on the
              other hand, it was obvious that a change in Soviet policy would be a slow process. To
              the outside world it was not always clear that a struggle was still going on between
              proponents of the two trends he had mentioned. The Soviet leaders must go slowly. The
              same trend and process was occurring slowly in the satellite countries.</p>
            <p>He said there were clear signs of a new orientation taking place and that in the
              satellites this new orientation was clearer among the masses than among the
              leadership. He felt there was, in fact, a definite new concept which did not involve a
              renunciation by the Soviets of the desire to have influence in the satellites, but was
              a change from the previous policy of iron control. He did not mean to suggest that the
              new Soviet leaders had all forgotten or given up all elements of Stalinism, which were
              in their minds, but he felt that the elements of Stalinism which were retained by
              people in the Soviet Union, and <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0724"/>particularly
              by leaders in the satellites, would become weaker as the views and policies of the
              present Soviet leadership became stronger.</p>
            <p>The Secretary asked him what elements in the Soviet Union were Stalinist-minded, and
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied that there were a vast number
              of relatively young and middle-aged functionaries in the <gloss target="#t_MVD1"
                >MVD</gloss> and elsewhere who had been brought up on Stalinist teachings. These
              elements represented a substantial force within the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> then made reference to the <persName
                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> visit to Belgrade and said it had been a very risky
              proposition for the Soviets. If nothing had come of it, they would have “ruined
              themselves”. He believed the visit had also had considerable influence on the attitude
              which the Soviets had subsequently taken at the Geneva Summit Conference.</p>
            <p>He said that in his judgment it was wise to support the present leaders in the Soviet
              Union against the Stalinist group and that this could be done particularly by
              developing contacts between the East and West. He added that present Soviet leadership
              was inclined toward a policy of relaxation of tensions and the opening of Soviet
              frontiers. It was a group which did not wish war, and included military figures such
              as <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Marshal Zhukov</persName>, who knew what the
              consequence of war today would be.</p>
            <p>Reverting back to the leadership in the satellites, they were still “mentally
              Stalinist”. Some tried to put on a new dress, but their minds had not changed.
              However, these leaders were under pressure from the satellite populations to change,
              and eventually new leaders would emerge. The Secretary said he saw no indication that
              the present satellite leaders would change. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> agreed, saying it would be difficult for them to do so. The
              Secretary said the example which President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> had set in asserting his independence of the Soviet Union must have
              had a very great effect among the satellite countries because it showed that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had the support of other countries which did not
              believe in Communism but did believe in the genuine independence of countries. He felt
              that other satellite countries might wish to follow <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s example.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said there was no doubt that
              the example of Yugoslavia had had a great impact on the states of Eastern Europe. The
              peoples of these states envied Yugoslavia’s independence and present position in the
              world. He said independence for the satellite states would not be a quick process. It
              would not happen at once, but on the other hand it would not happen too slowly.</p>
            <p>He mentioned the joint Soviet-Yugoslav communiqué<note n="20" xml:id="d263fn20">See
                  <ref target="#d251fn2">footnote 2, Document 251</ref>.</note> issued at the time
              of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s visit, and said that on Yugoslav
              insistence, <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0725"/>the principles of independence,
              non-interference in the internal affairs of a state, and the right of countries to
              seek their own way to socialism, had been included.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that what made the real bonds between the United States and
              Yugoslavia was the common belief in the right of every country to have independence
              and any system which it wished without having that system imposed from without.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Secretary said the United States was completely dedicated to the
              cause of peace. However, peace required a nation to be strong and to be willing to
              take risks to defend its national interests and independence. As the danger of war had
              receded in recent months there had been a loosening of the close ties between the
              Western countries which were banded together by the fear of Soviet aggression. Some
              people in the United States seemed to regret the relaxation of tensions because of
              this loosening of bonds between the Western allies. These people did not see that
              parallel with the loosening of bonds in the West there was also going on a loosening
              of bonds within the Soviet bloc, for it was difficult to see what was happening within
              the Soviet bloc. The Secretary said he felt strongly that such a loosening-up process
              was taking place in the European satellite states, and in this connection he paid
              tribute to the great contribution <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName>
              had made to this end by his actions in defending Yugoslavia’s national independence
              and aspirations.</p>
            <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said he fully agreed with the
              Secretary’s estimate regarding the loosening of bonds within the Soviet orbit, saying
              that the Yugoslavs were in a better position than others to observe this trend. (On
              the return trip from Vanga to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s residence
              at Brioni, Foreign Minister Popovic said the Secretary’s estimate of the loosening-up
              process occurring in the satellite area had been one of the most significant things
              which he had said to the Yugoslavs, and coincided with their judgment of the
              facts.)</p>
            <p>The meeting concluded with a brief discussion as to what the Secretary might say in
              his press conference<note n="21" xml:id="d263fn21">See <ref target="#d264fn5">footnote
                  5, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi></ref>.</note> and it was agreed that he would say
              he had reviewed for President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> the
              progress of the Geneva Conference; discussed the Middle East in the light of <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s forthcoming visit to Cairo; obtained <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s views on the present status of the Balkan
              Alliance; and discussed with him the states of Eastern Europe, having been in
              agreement with him that these states should be fully independent, that there should
              not be outside interference in their internal affairs, and that they should be free to
              choose their own social and economic systems.</p>

            <p>I had 2 unusually interesting days with the reopening of the Vienna Opera on Saturday
              night and then at Brioni with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> on
                Sunday.<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">Saturday, November 5, and Sunday, November
                6.</note></p>
            <p>At the opera I had a chance to talk with the President of Austria, with Chancellor
                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                >FonMin</gloss>

              merely to appreciate and pay tribute to the Viennese opera made I think a considerable
              hit with the government and people.</p>
            <p>The day with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was one of the most
              interesting I have ever spent. He was extremely open and friendly. After a luncheon at
              his Brioni residence, he took me in his small two-seater speedboard to an adjoining
              island where he amuses himself with simple construction, planting, some exotic animals
              and the like. Others of the company joined us at a more leisurely pace. (His boat
              makes 40 miles per hour.)</p>
            <p>We had a 3 hour talk partly in the sunlight and partly in a stone hut.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d264fn4">See <ref target="#d263"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>
              Topics were Geneva Conference and its problems, particularly problem of Germany and
              about Near East where he goes to visit <persName corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName>
              next month. We also talked about Balkan Alliance and about the satellites.</p>
            <p>The talk confirmed me in my opinion that while <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> undoubtedly likes to be in a position to get the best of both
              worlds he has no intention whatever of falling back into clutches of Soviet and he
              feels that while <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and <persName
                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> are definitely trying to substitute new and
              more tolerable policies than those of Stalin there is still a very strong Stalinist
              element within the Soviet Union representing those who were indoctrinated in their
              youth with Stalinism and there is always danger that they could take over and resume
              rough policies.</p>
            <p>While we did not always agree we had a very understanding talk. At close I remarked
              that while the decreased risk of war somewhat loosened ties between non-Communist
              nations because it diminished bond of fear it must also be remembered that a
              comparable process is going on within Soviet bloc and that authority there is being
              diluted and diversified. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> feels strongly
              that this is case and <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0727"/>was able to document
              this thesis on the basis of his knowledge more intimate than ours as to what is going
              on, particularly in satellite states. He is convinced Communist China is in no sense a
              satellite.</p>
            <p>Following our interview we went back to Brioni and there I had press conference in
              which he participated with me. I was able there to make a highly significant statement
              in which he concurred regarding independence for the states of Eastern Europe.<note

              Secretary from Secretary. Distribution as determined by Acting Secretary. Following
              dinner <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and I talked alone. He spoke for
              several minutes about his relations with Soviet Union, saying that having once been in
              their <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0728"/>clutches he would never risk getting
              there again, and that he thought that that should be evident. He was a frank man and
              spoke what he believed. He could not understand that there were those who seemed to
              feel he was following a policy of duplicity. I said I had never had any doubt as to
              complete integrity of his policy and his unwillingness to get back again into clutches
              of Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>I said principal difficulty in United States arose from Catholics who felt he was
              persecuting their religion. I asked whether it was not true there was very large
              freedom of religion. He said there was and that Catholics, Moslems and Orthodox all
              had complete freedom. He said the trouble arose about <persName corresp="#p_SAC1"
                >Stepinac</persName>, who was definitely proved to be a collaborator with Germans
              and who had been condemned to ten years and whom he had released after four, and he
              was now free and serving in a church.<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2"><persName
                  corresp="#p_SAC1">Aloysius Stepinac</persName>, Archbishop of Zagreb, was
                sentenced to 16 years in prison in October 1946, on charges of collaboration with
                the Germans. He was granted a conditional release in December 1951.</note> He could
              go to Rome if he wished. (In connection with this matter, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> showed first sign of emotionalism he had exhibited during entire
              visit. He spoke with considerable heat.)</p>
            <p>In riding to airfield with Popovic, we referred to our conversation with President
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. Popovic said most important aspect of
              our talk had been my recognition of fact that advent of more peaceful prospects, while
              it brought about a certain loosening of ties as between non-Soviet bloc countries,
              also brought about very considerable pressures for change within Soviet bloc. He said
              his government was probably in better position to appreciate this than most others and
              they were very conscious of this fact. But very few other people seemed to realize
              pressures within Soviet bloc which were weakening its cohesion.</p>
            <p>He asked about my talk with <persName corresp="#p_FBGF1">Franco</persName>.<note
                n="3" xml:id="d265fn3">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>

                  >Franco</persName> and other Spanish officials.</note> I said we had principally
              talked about Morocco and I had urged importance of French and Spanish trying to work
              out a common program. In this connection, I said I thought <persName corresp="#p_PA1"
                >Pinay</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d265fn4"><persName corresp="#p_PA1">Antoine
                  Pinay</persName>, French Minister of Foreign Affairs.</note> was showing good
              qualities and a better grasp of colonial problem and need for changing old French
              policy than any of his predecessors.</p>
            <p>Popovic spoke of Near East and of Baghdad Pact. He said he recognized full well the
              UK more than US had been pushing this latterly. I said that original concept of
              “northern tier” had been developed by me when I was in area some two and half years
              ago. In meanwhile, of course, there had been some changes and US had not been at all
              active in pushing pact and adherence of Iraq and Iran. I doubted however this
              inclusion of Iraq had any material bearing <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0729"
              />upon Arab-Israel situation or arms deal with Czechoslovakia. Popovic asked whether
                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had indicated any particular desire
              to find an accommodation on Near East situation. I said I had not detected any such
              desire. I had spoken to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> three times,
              but in each case he had attempted shrug off matter saying it was purely commercial
              transaction and had no political implications and he did not feel there was any cause
              to be concerned. Popovic said they recognized the situation was so delicate the
              injection of any new factor could be quite disturbing. I said we did not deny legal
              right of Russia to sell or Egypt to buy but that to inject a lot of new arms into
              situation was as irresponsible as giving lethal weapon to children to play with. I
              felt there was very great danger now in situation.</p>

                  <item><hi rend="italic">Course of Action C (Flexible Position).</hi> Under Course
                    of Action C, Yugoslavia would deny to both the West and the Soviet Bloc, the
                    strategic advantages which would accrue from the utilization of her forces and
                    her territory. The denial of the use of her forces could be expected to have
                    approximately an equal effect upon both the Soviets and the West. Current
                    estimates indicate that Yugoslavia will defend her national territory against
                    aggression. One aspect of the over-all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                    objective in the Southern European Command is to prevent the Soviets from
                    gaining access to the northern shore of the Mediterranean. In order to achieve
                    this objective the West need not occupy Yugoslavia, but need only have Yugoslav
                    territory denied the Soviets, whereas the converse is true with respect to the
                    Soviets. It follows that the denial of Yugoslavia’s geographical territory would
                    constitute a greater strategic disadvantage to the Soviets than it would to the
                    West. Thus, from the strategic viewpoint, the net effect of Course of Action C
                    would favor the West. So long as the present trend for better <persName
                      corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>-Soviet Bloc relations continues,
                    Yugoslavia’s wartime usefulness to the West is uncertain and its adherence to
                    the Balkan Pact commitments in time of war is doubtful. However, indications are
                    that the Yugoslav regime would endeavor to remain neutral in a general war, that
                      <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> would fight if directly attacked,
                    and that he might also enter the war as a consequence of his judgment as to the
                    course of hostilities and as to the advantages which he might gain from
                    participation. We believe, in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NIE1"
                      >NIE</gloss> 31–2–55 that Course of Action C is the course Yugoslavia has now
                    adopted and will continue so long as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"

            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next turned to his visit with
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName>, which he described as
                “illuminating”.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">See <ref target="#d263">Document
                  263</ref>.</note> The joint statement which he had issued with <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> at the conclusion of their conference (regarding
              the desirability of independence for the Soviet satellites)<note n="3"
                xml:id="d267fn3">Reference is to the statement made during the Secretary’s news
                conference; see <ref target="#d264fn5">footnote 5, Document 264</ref>.</note> was in
              itself worth the whole trip. While <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had
              uttered such sentiments as this before, he had never done so in a joint press
              conference with an American Secretary of State. This joint communiqué had really
              rocked the Russians back on their heels, and they were currently extremely angry at
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had also thrown much light on the
              current situation in the Soviet satellites. In most of them the governing regimes were
              Stalinist hangovers and were currently under very heavy pressure for a change in the
              direction of greater moderation and a more clearly nationalist orientation. At the
              moment, however, the Soviet Government <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0732"/>was
              continuing to support these Stalinist hangover regimes. Nevertheless, <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was confident that the Soviets could not hold out
              very much longer, and the changes in these regimes would occur in the not too distant
              future, perhaps in a matter of months or a year’s time.</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then expressed confidence
              that as a result of the expression of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
              and his own views, the problems of the USSR vis-à-vis the satellite states had been
              notably increased. They will have to be tougher in handling these regimes because of
              their fear that if they adopt softer policies they will lose control of the situation.
              In short, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, “they’ve got a
              hell of a lot of problems.”</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded his comments on his
              visit with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> by stating his conviction that
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was not playing a double game. While
              there was no doubt that he was trying to get the best of the two worlds, Soviet and
              free, there was no evidence whatever that he had turned his back on the West and had
              secretly rejoined the Soviet bloc.</p>

              military assistance to Yugoslavia programmed for end items through September 30, 1955
              reached $812.7 million. The dollar value of end items delivered by August 31, 1955 was
              $587.2 million. Shipments during calendar year 1955 (through August 31) totaled $76.7
              million.</p>
            <p>3. The Department of Defense after coordination with the Department of State issued
              instructions on June 13, 1955 to accord lowest priority to Yugoslavia for the receipt
              of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> equipment except for (1) material essential

              the cumulative total of U.S. economic assistance amounted to $525.1 million, of which
              $484.0 million had been shipped by June 30, 1955. The bulk of this assistance was in
              the form of surplus agricultural commodities, i.e., wheat and cotton.</p>

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am most thankful to you for your
              message of October 12.<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2"><ref target="#d262">Document
                  262</ref>.</note> We were all very glad to hear the news that you had recovered
              and already returned to your difficult duties.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> has, surely, informed
              you on our talks at Brioni.<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3">See <ref target="#d263"
                  >Document 263</ref>.</note> I think that this exchange of views on various
              problems which are of interest to both our governments, particularly from the point of
              view of the relaxation in the world and the preservation of peace, was very useful. We
              were all very pleased that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> gave us a clear picture on
              the course of the Geneva talks, and that he took a keen interest in our views on some
              problems. It is understandable that our views on some matters are different, but we
              were very pleased to be able to establish at the Brioni meeting that our basic aims
              were the same, i.e. to preserve peace and to achieve constructive cooperation among
              nations.</p>
            <p>As far as the results of the Geneva Conference are concerned, it is my personal
              opinion and the opinion of my associates as well, that these results are not
              discouraging since the possibility of continuing the talks about problems on which no
              agreement could be reached, or on which only a partial agreement was achieved, has
              been preserved. Such an outcome is still significant if we compare it with the
              situation as it existed two years ago. I think that the “Geneva spirit” from your July
              meeting has been preserved. Knowing now the views of your Government, which were
              outlined to us by Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, and, on the other hand, knowing the
              views of the Soviet Government, I am today much more of an optimist than, for
              instance, a year ago. It is because we see that your Government as well as the Soviet
              Government exclude the use of force as a means to solve international problems, and
              that on both sides there is readiness for talks, though they might take time.</p>
            <p>I should like to assure you, Mr. President, that I and my associates will endeavour,
              as far as it is within our possibilities, to explain <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707"
                facs="0735"/>to the Soviet leaders our views on various problems. Some signs allow
              me to believe this may prove to be of some benefit.</p>
            <p>I am now leaving to return the visit to the Emperor of Ethiopia,<note n="4"
                xml:id="d269fn4"><persName corresp="#p_SH1">Haile Selassie</persName>.</note> and on
              my way home I shall pay a visit to Egypt.<note n="5" xml:id="d269fn5"><persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit to Egypt in February 1956 was followed
                by a meeting of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, <persName
                  corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                  >Nehru</persName> at Brioni on July 18 and 19. An analysis of the meeting, which
                reflected the continuing concern of the United States over <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s role as a neutralist, is in Intelligence
                Brief No. 1976, July 26, 1956. (Department of State, PPS Files: Lot 66 D 487)</note>
              Of course, I have no pretension whatsoever to be a mediator in the conflict between
              Israel and Egypt, yet I will, as I have already told Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>,
              try in my talks with the Egyptian leaders and with President <persName
                corresp="#p_NLCGA1">Nasser</persName> to act in the direction of relaxation, in
              accordance with the principles of our foreign policy.</p>
            <p>I thank you warmly for your interest in my health, which is now, after a successful
              cure at Brioni, very good. Sincerely,</p>

                POLICY TOWARD YUGOSLAVIA</head>
              <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
              <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">US-Yugoslav Relations 1948–1954</hi></p>
              <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>–Kremlin break of 1948 and the
                consequent departure of Yugoslavia from the Soviet bloc served U.S. interests
                through (a) the continued denial to the USSR of important strategic positions and
                other assets, and (b) the political effects, on both sides of the iron curtain, of a
                break in the “monolithic” Communist bloc.</p>
              <p>2. In order to preserve these gains, the U.S. extended economic and military aid to
                Yugoslavia. This aid was of crucial importance in keeping the <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> regime afloat under severe Soviet pressures
                and—by indicating U.S. concern with Yugoslavia’s independence—in discouraging any
                Soviet inclination to attack Yugoslavia.</p>
              <p>3. A further U.S. purpose, as the military and economic aid programs developed, has
                been to utilize them to influence Yugoslavia <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0737"
                />toward closer political, economic and military collaboration with the West, and to
                encourage such internal changes in Yugoslavia as would facilitate this orientation.
                The military aid program in particular has been directed toward achieving the
                eventual collaboration of Yugoslav forces with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                forces in the defense of Yugoslavia and northern Italy.</p>
              <p>4. The cumulative amount of U.S. military aid to Yugoslavia programmed from 1951
                through 30 June 1955 was $799.4 million, of which $568 million in end-items had been
                delivered and $1.5 million in training had been utilized as of May 31, 1955.
                Yugoslavia hopes for and may expect delivery of the remainder ($229.9 million) on
                terms acceptable to it, and may even request additional equipment, especially of
                more modern types, beyond what is presently programmed.</p>
              <p>5. U.S. economic grant aid programmed since the <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName>–Kremlin break totalled $503,200,000 through June 1955, of which
                $485,400,000 had been expended. Economic aid has fallen broadly into two categories:
                (a) raw materials as defense support, and (b) food, to meet the problems caused
                largely by serious droughts and chronic food deficit conditions. In the last two
                fiscal years, economic aid programs have consisted largely of food grants from U.S.
                surplus agricultural commodities.</p>
              <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soviet “Normalization“ Policy</hi></p>
              <p>6. After the death of Stalin, the USSR gradually undertook a campaign to
                “normalize” relations with Yugoslavia, which since 1948 had been characterized by
                Soviet dedication to the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
                regime. About September 1954, the “normalization” campaign was intensified. Military
                and political pressures against Yugoslavia were relaxed; trade, which had been
                completely severed since 1948, was resumed; and the Soviet propaganda line
                ostentatiously switched from hostility to acceptance and even praise of the
                  <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> regime. In May–June 1955 the campaign
                reached a high point with the visit, on Soviet initiative, of the top Soviet leaders
                to Belgrade to confer, on a basis of equality, with those so recently excoriated as
                apostates and traitors. This visit was marked by (a) a Soviet confession of error in
                previous policy toward Yugoslavia, (b) a joint communiqué providing a basis for
                settlement of outstanding differences and showing a substantial identity of views on
                various international questions, and (c) a rapprochement between the Soviet and
                Yugoslav Governments and Communist parties, the ultimate extent of which is still
                unclear. Early in September, the two countries concluded agreements in principle on
                trade and credit arrangements over the years 1956–8 which are both useful and
                favorable to Yugoslavia.</p>
              <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0738"/>
              <p>7. The ultimate objective of Soviet strategy toward Yugoslavia is probably the
                reassertion in some effective form of Soviet control over that country. For the
                shorter term, the Soviet objective is probably the effective neutralization of
                Yugoslavia, so that it will not maintain security ties with the free world and so
                that its armed forces and terrain will be denied to the U.S. and its allies.</p>
              <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Development of Yugoslav Policy</hi></p>
              <p>8. Consistently since 1948, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s main
                purpose has been to preserve Yugoslavia’s independence and his regime. In the period
                of extreme Soviet pressure, he attempted to assure himself of military support from
                the West in case of war and found it expedient to obtain Western aid. Yugoslav
                military talks with the U.S., UK and France in 1953 and conclusion of the Balkan
                Alliance with Greece and Turkey in 1954 seemed to indicate the possibility of future
                Yugoslav association with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense system.
                Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> remained cautious and
                tried to maintain as much independence of policy as his difficult external and
                internal situation allowed. With the change in Soviet policies, he has been less
                concerned with the possibility of Soviet attack and has interpreted Soviet moves,
                including the visit of Soviet leaders, as signalizing Soviet acceptance of
                Yugoslavia’s independent position and as contributing to relaxation of tensions.</p>
              <p>9. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> has given no
                evidence of willingness to let Yugoslavia fall under Soviet control; and it is
                improbable that Yugoslavia will do so, at least so long as he is in power. However,
                it is not altogether clear what limits <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                has set in his relations with the USSR, how far the accommodation may go, or what
                its ultimate effects may be, regardless of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName>’s personal wishes to keep the rapprochement within safe
                bounds.</p>
              <p>10. Yugoslavia’s “normalization” of relations with the Soviet bloc has been
                accompanied by resistance to ties with the West closer than those already developed,
                reflecting a desire for freedom of action vis-à-vis both sides. This trend has been
                strengthened by (a) greater realization of the meaning of the overwhelming nuclear
                power of the U.S. and the USSR; (b) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
                attraction to the line taken by such countries as India, Burma and Egypt, and his
                desire to play a role on the world stage (evidenced by the furnishing of arms to
                Burma and recently to Egypt); (c) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
                hope of influencing developments in the satellites, which he thinks Yugoslavia can
                do better as an independent communist state than as a close associate of the Western
                powers; (d) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s fear lest the swing to
                the West go too far and become a danger to the maintenance of Communist rule in
                Yugoslavia.</p>
              <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0739"/>
              <p>11. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will wish to
                continue building up his own armed forces with such American aid as he can get. He
                also continues to show a desire, as insurance, to retain at least an indirect, if
                somewhat attenuated, security tie with the West through the Balkan Alliance, and
                appears to wish to count on military support from the West if the Soviet threat to
                Yugoslavia should reappear. There is a possibility that he would sacrifice these
                minimal security ties with the West, including U.S. military aid, if events should
                cause him to question the continued compatibility of these ties with this foreign
                policy of non-alignment.</p>
              <p>12. Current Yugoslav policy raises the question of current U.S. objectives in
                Yugoslavia. The original limited objective of keeping Yugoslavia independent of the
                Soviet bloc has been well served by timely aid. The more far-reaching objective of
                tying Yugoslavia into the Western system and ensuring its effective contribution to
                free world power in case of war in Europe, chiefly through a larger-scale military
                aid program and the growth of U.S. and Western influence, has not been attained and
                there is no sound indication that it is attainable. In case of general war,
                Yugoslavia will probably remain neutral as long as the situation permits, and
                Yugoslav forces will be used as the Yugoslav leadership deems appropriate to ensure
                the regime’s own survival, rather than as a means of protecting northern Italy or
                carrying out <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> plans. Yugoslavia has recently
                given the U.S. high-level oral assurances that it will never permit the passage of
                foreign troops over its soil during any war in which Yugoslavia remains a
                non-belligerent. Although Yugoslavia appears to recognize a common interest with us
                in weakening the Soviet hold on the satellites, in its general policy, Yugoslavia
                can be expected to follow a more neutralist line. It will stress its independence
                while seeking the benefits of friendly relations with the West and improved
                relations with the Soviet Union. Accordingly, in pursuit of its own interests, the
                Yugoslav position will continue to coincide on some matters with that of the Soviets
                and on others with that of the West.</p>
              <p>13. It is in the U.S. interest that Yugoslavia (a) maintain the will and ability to
                resist Soviet domination, (b) continue to deny its resources to the Soviet bloc and
                withstand Soviet economic pressures, (c) use its potential for weakening the
                monolithic front and internal cohesiveness of the Soviet bloc, (d) play a part in
                deterring Soviet bloc aggressive, (e) maintain sufficient economic strength and
                stability to enable Yugoslavia to do the above, and (f) continue to hold to its
                Balkan Alliance with Greece and Turkey. Yugoslavia requires the political and
                material support of the U.S. more than the U.S. needs Yugoslavia. On the other hand,
                because of Yugoslavia’s peculiar value to the U.S. in Eastern Europe, the U.S.
                should guard against taking measures which would force Yugoslavia into the Soviet
                bloc. <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0740"/>The general attitude of the U.S. in
                dealing with Yugoslavia and U.S. consideration of Yugoslav requests for aid should
                take into account the above factors.</p>

                requests for export licenses so long as its export policies are generally consistent
                with the objectives of the multilateral trade controls imposed against the Soviet
                bloc. Continue to permit the Yugoslavs to purchase in the U.S. military equipment

              adopted, apparently without discussion, the draft <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715"

            <p>At the same meeting, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"

                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence said that he had a word or two to say with
                  respect to Yugoslavia although what he was going to say was not likely to change
                  the Council’s decision on the previous agenda item since it was still the estimate
                  of the intelligence community that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal
                    Tito</persName>’s primary objective was to maintain the independence of
                  Yugoslavia. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then proceeded to cite the recent
                  trade agreements between Yugoslavia and several of the Soviet Bloc countries. Mr.
                    <persName>Dulles</persName> estimated that as a result of these agreements
                  Yugoslav trade with the Bloc might rise from 20 per cent at the present time to
                  perhaps 30 per cent in the next few years. He pointed out that before Yugoslavia
                  broke away from the Soviet Bloc, 50 per cent of its foreign trade had been with
                  the Bloc. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> next referred to <persName

              <item>In elaboration of foregoing, <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> told

                  >Khrushchev</persName> had gone. Yugoslav Government had expected changes, but not
                of this magnitude or tempo. Already substance of speech was being given to Soviet
                Party organization with instructions to spread the word. <persName corresp="#p_PS1"
                  >Prica</persName> said Yugoslav Government was sure that 6 to 7,000 persons had
                been released from prison or rehabilitated, including Maisky, and Soviet commission
                was working on thousands of other cases with same end. “A number of NKVD personnel
                were being imprisoned”. <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>, Pi jade and
                  <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> all thought text of speech would
                eventually be published in USSR, particularly as Soviet leaders now realized Stalin
                system was contrary to their own interests and Russian people must be convinced that
                reforms were coming. Larger degree of decentralization was necessary and was clearly
                indicated by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech. It was
                beginning of “democratization” of Soviet system, from which many changes would
                inevitably follow.</item>

                that Yugoslav Government had no foreknowledge that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                  >Khrushchev</persName> would so sharply attack Stalin. <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                  >Kardelj</persName> said that during visit last May when Yugoslavs criticized
                Stalin, Soviet leaders still defended him and blamed <persName corresp="#p_BLP1"
                  >Beria</persName>. Therefore obvious that decisions of paramount importance had
                been made between last May and <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Congress and
                that eventually full scope of these decisions must be revealed. <persName

              <item>In satellites, all agreed that reaction had been uneven. <persName
                  corresp="#p_BH1">Brkic</persName> thought that time was propitious for loosening
                of control over satellites but was cautious in predicting when any real freedom
                might develop. There was slight difference of view respecting future of <gloss

                  corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> expressed personal opinion that it would be
                formally abolished. In Poland and Czechoslovakia there are already indications of
                liberalization of policy particularly with respect to freer expression of opinion,
                less rigid party discipline and recognition that other points of view must be given
                consideration. In Hungary, developments were still uncertain and it would be
                difficult to predict how matters would go there. Both <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                  >Kardelj</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> expressed the
                firm belief that in one way or another <persName corresp="#p_RM1">Rakosi</persName>
                would have to go and that he could not survive indefinitely. In Bulgaria, <persName
                  corresp="#p_CV1">Chervenkov</persName>’s personal position was somewhat better but
                he too would have eventual difficulties in surviving the changed situation.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Re China, Yugoslav leaders were more uncertain. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                  >Brkic</persName> thought that it was not clear yet how <persName corresp="#p_MT1"
                  >Mao</persName> would deal with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                speech. In spite of press speculation that <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName>
                was faced with difficult problem, <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>
                expressed opinion that these developments would not embarrass <persName
                  corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> who would readily adapt himself to new line. This
                was particularly true as he thought Western countries had never fully appreciated
                extent of Chinese independence from Moscow.</item>
              <label>7.</label>
              <item>In response to my query how in their opinion Western world should react to
                  <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech, both <persName

                  >Prica</persName> strongly urged that US particularly should display a maximum of
                good will and not neglect this opportunity. <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                  >Kardelj</persName> thought that the three specific fields in which progress could
                be made were (a) disarmament, (b) increased contacts, and (c) trade relations.
                  <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> thought that we would shortly see an
                improved Soviet attitude re disarmament. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_PS1"
                  >Prica</persName> emphasized the high desirability of visits by Soviet leaders to
                Western countries. Both hoped that the forthcoming visit to the UK<note n="5"
                  xml:id="d272fn5">Soviet leaders <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>

                  17–27.</note> would have good results. They also hoped this <pb n="718"
                  xml:id="pg_718" facs="0746"/>would be followed by increasing contacts and agreed
                that Soviet leaders were exceedingly ignorant of Western world. This ignorance could
                only be overcome by greater contact and knowledge. They hoped the US would take the
                lead in this connection as it was doing in the disarmament question.</item>
              <label>8.</label>
              <item>While I was primarily a listener in these conversations, I did take occasion
                with <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> to issue a general caveat
                respecting the difficulties which the Western world would experience in accepting
                Soviet statements at their face value in view of our experiences. I said it would
                not be forgotten that however much we might want to encourage developments in the
                Soviet Union in a direction which both the US and the Yugoslav Governments wished to
                see, nonetheless caution was indicated and the West could not lower its guard until
                more adequate proof of Soviet intentions was forthcoming. It was furthermore
                necessary that public opinion in the US be convinced of the reality of change in
                Soviet policy. I said these comments also applied equally to US-Yugoslav relations
                and that our public opinion was sensitive to Yugoslav decisions which seemed to
                indicate larger cooperation with Soviet front organizations. I cited the <gloss
                  target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss> and the question of enlarged Communist Party
                relations as cases in point. <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> said that
                Yugoslav Government was cognizant of these problems but put in a strong plea to the
                effect that the power and prestige of the US was so great it could afford to adopt
                an imaginative approach and take chances for the preservation of peace. This was
                particularly true inasmuch as he thought Soviet leaders had now realized that third
                world conflict was impossible for any country to sustain.</item>

              Yugoslavia is consistently following USSR lead. This was clear in yesterday’s meeting

              <item>At his request I saw <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> today to
                discuss future military aid. He was informed of my conversation with Tempo
                yesterday, and said he realized Yugoslav Government had been slow in responding to
                our conversation of March 28. He said this resulted partially from his illness but
                more importantly from complex problems which this question raised in changed
                circumstances. Viewpoint of Yugoslav Government was as follows:</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Changes in USSR had undoubtedly made military aid matters less urgent. New
                possibilities in disarmament were emerging and threat of military aggression had
                indubitably lessened. This did not mean the Yugoslav Government would give up its
                military power and it certainly did not want to abandon its military cooperation
                with US. Nonetheless we would perhaps agree that military aid problems did not have
                same urgency as before. Yugoslav Government hoped that US would not insist upon
                linking military to economic aid and that two governments could proceed to discuss
                latter at early date. Yugoslav Government was definitely interested in future
                military aid but realized that political overtones existed which would have to be
                clarified. He remarked that discussions between Yugoslav military and <gloss
                  target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss> were now underway which would establish exact
                status of approved programs. In these circumstances, Yugoslav Government would
                prefer to postpone a definite answer until present technical talks were
                concluded.</item>
              <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0748"/>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>I replied that as I had said yesterday to Tempo we were not pressing Yugoslav
                Government for immediate answer. [Garble] was impelled to observe that Yugoslav
                Government was now largely formed of items of 1950-55 program, time was passing and
                future programs had to be prepared well in advance of Congressional action. From our
                previous discussion, I was certain <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName>
                realized military aid could not be supplied in a vacuum and some basis of planning
                was required. <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> said these points were
                understood and would be taken into account by Yugoslav Government.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>It is clear to <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">General Waters</persName> and me
                that Yugoslav Government does not want to embark upon discussions until it has
                extracted all available information it can respecting our intentions. Yugoslav
                Government now informed of all items 1950–55 program expect revalidation Air Force
                fiscal year 1955 program. Essential elements F– 86E delivery program for necessary
                pre-delivery training have been released with <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss>
                recommendation to <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> to start deliveries in
                July. No information on fiscal year 1956 as yet given on Army, Navy, or Air to
                Yugoslav Government. We thought advisable to hold up release of revalidated Air
                Force fiscal year 1955 program and three fiscal year 1956 programs. Both <persName
                  corresp="#p_WGJK1">General Waters</persName> and I also believe that political
                considerations are behind Yugoslav desire to postpone discussions on military aid
                which would inevitably raise questions of adequate information and planning. If
                Yugoslav Government is unwilling to engage in realistic discussions at this time,
                there is probably no point in forcing the issue. Therefore recommend that we leave
                matters as they are pending further consideration inside Yugoslav Government.</item>

              <item>With <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName>, I followed paragraphs one to

                with examples to buttress directly points made. (In background was information we

                suspended. No allusion was made to this in my interviews today and Yugoslavs seem
                therefore to be taking it calmly.) <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> took
                careful notes on what I had to say and said he would have to discuss it within

                figures of deliveries January–June 1955 of $73 million as compared with January–May
                1956 of $12 million. Also <gloss target="#t_DFS1">DFS</gloss> program was being
                changed and Yugoslav military encountered difficulty in receiving precise
                information on schedule of shipment. Therefore Yugoslav Government thought that
                military program was not going in normal way and US had disturbed spirit of October
                1 agreement. I then proceeded to demolish this weak tu quo que argument with an
                array of facts, not omitting to remind <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> I
                had warned Yugoslav Government throughout last summer that failure to settle our
                difficulties would inevitably delay deliveries. He then begged off discussing
                implementation of program on plea he was not technically competent. I replied
                  <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">General Waters</persName> and I would be prepared to
                discuss his complaints with <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Gosnjak</persName> at any
                time. <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> then said my observations were
                most important, as would be my interview with Tempo, and Yugoslav Government must
                study them carefully. He proposed that we resume on May 14 as this would give time
                for study over weekend, to which I promptly agreed. He was most restrained in his
                replies and while I may be wrong, I sense sober second thoughts on Yugoslav
                part.</item>

                Foreign Secretary thought recent difficulties were really of secondary importance
                but Yugoslav Government realized after my remarks to <persName corresp="#p_PS1"

                more careful explanation on political plane and how its policy affected military
                aid. Yugoslav Government was convinced, he said, both governments want to carry out
                announced military program which it believes is mutually advantageous. United States
                military aid has been and is of great importance to Yugoslavia and it would welcome
                [any] assurance United States can give that aid as programmed will be received and
                would appreciate as much information as we can give of delivery schedule in order it
                may properly do its part. It is true in history of our military collaboration that
                United States attaches importance to size <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss>
                staff for reasons explained and likewise that Yugoslav Government for other reasons
                has always wished to hold down size. But this attitude has not and does not today
                indicate any change of basic Yugoslav policy and he hoped we would accept his
                categorical assurance to the <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0753"/>effect. It was
                on this fundamental postulate that he would later suggest how we would jointly
                implement October 1 memorandum.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>On political plane Yugoslav policy vis-à-vis Soviets is obviously difficult.
                Yugoslav Government considers United States military assistance as positive element
                in its policy and neither government should underestimate effect of this aid in
                modifying Soviet policy. Yugoslav Government was convinced that fact itself of
                United States aid had resulted in changes of Soviet policy of far-reaching
                consequence. Yugoslav Government also freely admitted United States aid had enabled
                it to hold its own against East and thereby helped to bring about changes we are now
                witnessing. Perhaps our respective estimates on Soviet changes could differ, but
                Yugoslav Government could not underestimate importance of factor of United States
                military aid and, therefore, it had every interest to work out secondary problems.
                What <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> had meant was to ask United States
                not to render present Yugoslav policy vis-à-vis USSR more difficult, and try to
                settle our joint problems with understanding of Yugoslav position and difficulties.
                There were obviously difficulties for both sides in implementing military program
                but he had no wish to revive past controversies and Yugoslav Government wanted to
                clear the table and adjust immediately our present difficulties. He still thought it
                wise to defer our proposed conversations of future aid but this should not affect
                solution of secondary difficulties. In implementation of October 1 memorandum he,
                therefore, proposed following:</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Yugoslav Government would approve at once five new personnel for <gloss
                  target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss>. As deliveries under programs are resumed, Yugoslav
                Government will make no difficulty on personnel questions and will work them out
                with us. He would put in strong plea not to force the pace on new assignments for
                political reasons explained above, but these personnel questions could and would be
                worked out as program advanced.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Re future military aid, I replied I had only one caveat to avoid future
                misunderstanding. We had not pressed Yugoslav Government and indeed subject had been
                raised by <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Gosnjak</persName>. We stood ready to enter
                into discussions when Yugoslav Government was prepared. I merely wished to observe
                that as months went by time was lost as we had to prepare estimates well in advance
                and this type of planning could not be done in a vacuum. We had already witnessed
                effect of difficulties last year on announced military program. Foreign Secretary
                said he understood this point.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>My estimate is that Yugoslav Government, after salutary jolt was received, has
                now receded in principle from its repudiation of parts of October 1 memorandum and
                wants to reestablish status quo ante on face-saving device of agreeing to increase
                in <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss> personnel <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726"
                  facs="0754"/>as deliveries increase. Inasmuch as that is what we plan, I think we
                should not quarrel with it. No doubt we may have arguments in future on exact number
                of personnel, but I believe interviews with Foreign Secretary and Tempo have
                established validity of October 1 memorandum. As a part impending request for visas
                will represent replacement personnel over next three months and as exact composition
                of <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss> may, from our point of view, depend upon
                how future military aid develops, it seems to me we have gained our point and can
                now resume.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>Recommend, therefore, suspension of delivery F–86–Es be lifted and effort made
                to deliver them on May 21. Personnel actions be resumed upon receipt advice from
                  <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss> respecting movements scheduled for near
                future. Shipment support equipment for first-wing F–86–E can likewise be

              <item>Foreign Secretary then touched briefly on wheat problem expressing hope we could
                soon give some indication of what could be expected for fiscal year 1957. I
                explained once again we could not make commitments until Congress concludes action

            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> told the Ambassador that he had
              asked the latter to call so that he might be informed informally of the difficulties
              which the Department had been experiencing with Congress in obtaining legislative
              authorization for additional assistance to Yugoslavia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> said that the situation had been complicated by the press
              treatment of President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s remarks in the
              USSR which had made the Secretary’s task even harder than anticipated and had put the
              Secretary under pressure by some members of Congress for explanations of current
              Yugoslav policies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> also noted that
              similar trouble had arisen from <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
              statement in Stalingrad which was open to the interpretation that Yugoslavia might
              side with Russia in any future war.<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2"><persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s statement was reported in telegram 1523 from
                Belgrade, June 15. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 768.11/6–1556)</note></p>
            <p>Since the Ambassador had not yet obtained the text of this statement, Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> read him English translations of the slightly
              differing Soviet and Yugoslav versions of it, and a discussion ensued about possible
              errors in translation. The Ambassador then stated, however, that from the context as
              he had just heard it, it seemed clear that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> had only referred to Soviet-Yugoslav solidarity during World War
              II. He could not assume that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s remarks
              implied any pledge of future Soviet-Yugoslav alliance in war, since such a move would
              run counter to the fundamentals of Yugoslav foreign policy which <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> himself had repeatedly confirmed. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that the Secretary had given the
              statement the same interpretation which the Ambassador had just made, but the
              Secretary wanted to be sure that he was correct in so doing. Ambassador <persName
                corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> that this had to be the case.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> went on to repeat that, in any
              event, such ambiguous remarks compounded an already difficult situation. The Secretary
              had taken a firm position that the situation was unchanged and that the basic premise
              of US policy towards Yugoslavia was intact. However, the Secretary hoped that Belgrade
              understood the conditions with which he was dealing and would find it possible to
              adopt a more helpful attitude.</p>

            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> concluded by underlining the
              importance of the long-range trend of relations between the US and Yugoslavia. These

              statements by President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. Of course, no

              he wished, but it was desirable to avoid difficulties of this nature.</p>

            <p><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit to the USSR (June 2–20) brought
              Yugoslav-Soviet relations into closer harmony, but left Yugoslavia a fellow-traveler
              rather than a committed member of the Soviet bloc. Ideologically, Yugoslavia’s ties
              with the Soviet bloc have been strengthened. Politically, Belgrade appeared still to
              be occupying the same position of a would-be middleman between opposing blocs that it
              has long tried to assume and exploit.</p>
            <p>Only two new developments emerged from the public statements during the visit: <list>
                <label>(1)</label>
                <item>Reestablishment of party-to-party relations, a development only hinted at
                  during the Soviet visit in Belgrade (May 26–June 2, 1955).</item>
                <label>(2)</label>
                <item>Further Yugoslav alignment with the Soviet position on international questions
                  as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> for the first time publicly
                  espoused Moscow’s view that general disarmament should not be dependent on prior
                  settlement of political issues and seconded the Soviet call for direct
                  negotiations between the two parts of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                    >Tito</persName> did not, however, commit Yugoslavia to recognize East Germany,
                  despite reported Soviet pressure to do so.</item>
              </list></p>
            <p>Otherwise, the joint communiqué and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
              speeches revealed approximately the same close similarity between the Yugoslav and the
              Soviet positions as has existed for the past two or three years.<note n="2"
                xml:id="d279fn2">An analysis of the speeches made by both <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"

                sent to the Department of State in despatch 31 from Moscow, July 13, by
                  <persName>John C. Guthrie</persName>, First Secretary of the Embassy. The despatch
                reported that in the joint communiqué the two governments expressed agreement on
                most international issues. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files,
                768.11/7–1356) Additional analysis of the communiqué is in telegram 2886 from
                Moscow, June 21. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 768.11/ 6–2156) The text of the
                communiqué is printed in <hi rend="italic">Documents</hi> (R.I.I.A.) for 1956, p.
                381.</note></p>
            <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0757"/>
            <p>There is no evidence at present that the talks reached any agreement on military
              matters, although the USSR sought to give the impression that the two countries would
              be allies in event of war. Yugoslavia thus apparently still looks only to the Western
              powers for military aid.</p>
            <p>The joint communiqué called for a further extension of economic ties, but did not
              reveal any concrete actions. Economic relations have shown such a marked improvement
              during the past year, however, that presumably little additional action was
              necessary.</p>
            <p>Both sides hailed the visit as a great success, and there is no evidence yet to
              indicate that the talks ran into any serious snags. The atmosphere of harmony was not
              complete, however, since <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is said to have
              shown displeasure with <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s statement that
              the two countries would march shoulder to shoulder in any future war. (<persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> denied that he made a similar statement in
                Stalingrad.)<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">See <ref target="#d278"><hi rend="italic"
                    >supra</hi></ref>.</note></p>
            <p>The Soviet rulers sought to treat <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
              presence as a happy homecoming to the Communist family, and accorded him a welcome
              unprecedented in Soviet history. While the family reunion succeeded in reestablishing
              fraternal relations with a once-errant member, it did not reestablish the same
              parental authority that had once been defied. It seems unlikely, however, that Moscow
              had expected that the Yugoslavs could be induced to accept such an authority, since
              this would be tantamount to asking <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to
              throw away much of the prestige and some of the power he had acquired over the past
              eight years.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Moscow felt no restriction against implicitly inviting the West to
              give up its ties with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. Although the
              Soviet rulers in their speeches disclaimed any desire to injure Yugoslav relations
              with the West, they all leaned hard to give the impression that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit had produced the closest possible
              alignment between the USSR and Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavs appeared aware of this Soviet
              maneuver, and leaned hard the other way to reassure that Yugoslavia’s welcome of the
              Soviet embrace did not mean the end of friendly relations with the West.</p>
            <p>Moscow’s emphasis on <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s return to the
              family appears also intended for the satellites. Presumably they are expected to view
              this development as indicating that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is
              willing to acknowledge the correctness of current Soviet policy and to recognize the
              Soviet bloc as the mainstay of world Communism. Moscow is thus seeking to blur
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s independent status in satellite eyes.
              Nevertheless, the fact <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0758"/>remains that the
              Soviet Union made the first move to heal the breach and has agreed to a special status
              for its relations with Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>What effect Moscow’s acknowledgment of this special role for Yugoslavia will have on
              Soviet relations with Communist China and the satellites remains to be seen. The
              Soviet regime has long accorded Peiping special treatment, and the Eastern European
              satellites are in no position to demand any improvement in their relations.</p>
            <p>Since the Yugoslav position on most international issues has long been parallel to
              that of the USSR, the main visible concrete gain for Moscow from <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s trip is the agreement to establish
              party-to-party relations. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
              unsuccessfully pressed for such an agreement in Belgrade last June to lessen the
              appearance of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s independence and to
              dramatize Moscow’s willingness to support united action with foreign socialists.</p>
            <p>The Yugoslavs finally agreed, presumably because the relations were to be
              reestablished on <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s terms. These included
              a Soviet commitment to recognize the equality of the two parties, accept informal
              bilateral ties rather than a new institution (such as a replacement for the <gloss
                target="#t_Cominform1">Cominform</gloss>), and agree that both sides would enjoy
              freedom of action in contrast to the discipline traditionally required of foreign
              Communist parties. Under this arrangement, Belgrade could present the ties as no
              different from its relations with Western Socialist parties.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Yugoslav Communists are sufficiently self-confident to regard the
              reestablishment of party relations, especially if extended to the satellites, as
              providing them with a channel for seeking to increase their own influence within the
              Soviet bloc.</p>
            <p>Whether <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> succeeded in inducing the Soviet
              rulers to complete the rapprochement by agreeing to further personnel changes in
              Eastern Europe would naturally not be revealed in the joint communiqué. Belgrade has
              been outspoken in its insistence that Hungary’s <persName corresp="#p_RM1"
                >Rakosi</persName> be removed; it has shown displeasure that Albania’s
                anti-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> leadership still remains in power;
              and it has apparently not been satisfied by <persName corresp="#p_CV1"
                >Chervenkov</persName>’s dismissal in Bulgaria. It seems likely that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> would have brought up the issue, but Moscow’s
              reaction will probably be revealed only by future developments within the
              satellites.</p>
            <p>Only time will also tell what further impressions of the current Soviet rulers and
              their policies were acquired by <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. He has
              been outspoken in contending that the post-Stalin regime has embarked on a new course,
              and the present Soviet rulers undoubtedly sought to strengthen his conviction in the
              expectation that he could serve as an acceptable reference for their claims.</p>

            <p>2906. The negative features of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit
              from the point of view Western policies and purposes are so obvious as to require
              little comment. There was little reason to expect any other result and, as <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> himself pointed out in his Dynamo speech,<note
                n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s address delivered at a mass meeting in Dynamo Stadium in Moscow,
                June 19.</note> it represents the logical continuation and development of last
              year’s Belgrade visit. Indeed long before visit it had been apparent that once Soviets
              were prepared to make confession of “ideological” error and accept Yugoslav position
              on relationship between Communist states there was literally no barrier to development
              solidarity in all respects between Yugoslavia and Soviet Union (<gloss

            <p>Yugoslavia has in international affairs indeed rejoined Communist community and we
              can expect in future on all important international questions to find Yugoslavia lined
              up with Soviet column. In general, however, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> has rejoined community on his own terms and there is not slightest
              indication in communiqué or declaration that Yugoslavia has lost, at least up to the
              present, its independence or has reverted to satellite status in regard to the Soviet
              Union, although by adopting publicly Soviet positions he has voluntarily limited his
              freedom of action. On the contrary, from every indication Soviets were scrupulous in
              their respect of independent and equal status of Yugoslavia both in governmental and
              in party discussions, and made no attempt, so far as I can ascertain, to reassert
              Soviet control or even right of guidance over Yugoslav Government or party. Fact that
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s return was voluntary and not dictated
              does not, however, change the basic fact that from Western point of view Yugoslavia
              has found common positions with Soviet Union on all major international issues and
              there is no reason to believe unless Soviets change current line or overplay their
              hand, which I doubt, that this will not continue to develop; and identification of
              Yugoslavs with Soviet Union will not go even farther.</p>
            <p>While Soviets undoubtedly expect that Yugoslav rapprochement with Soviet Union will
              result in estrangement with West, especially US, there is no evidence that they made
              any such request or demand on <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. Indeed,
              since they themselves are promoting idea of improving <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732"
                facs="0760"/>relations with all countries they were hardly in position to ask
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to do the opposite. I do not know
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> well enough, nor the situation in
              Yugoslavia, to judge to what extent results of visit were in accordance with <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s desires, or whether in some degree he was
              outmaneuvered by Soviets during this visit. It would hardly seem likely that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> left to himself would wish to return regardless
              of changes in Soviet attitude to a state of dependence on Soviet Union which would be
              natural result estrangement from West.</p>
            <p>In sum, I cannot judge whether <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> has
              deliberately elected to line up with the Soviet Union with the inevitable
              deterioration of his relations with the US as a conscious act, or whether he still
              believes that he can enjoy the benefit of playing both sides of the street. I found
              particularly striking during his visit here fact that in none of innumerable
              statements and speeches which he made was there any favorable word for the Western
              powers in general, or the slightest recognition of the assistance he had received from
              them, especially US. On the contrary, he made no attempt to refute vicious Soviet
              attacks on the motivation of aid to Yugoslavia from capitalist counties which was
              particularly noticeable in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s Dynamo
                speech<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">Despatch 31 from Moscow, July 31, reported that
                  <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> charged that Yugoslavia had
                obtained aid from the West in order to exploit Soviet-Yugoslav differences and to
                restore capitalism to Yugoslavia. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> visit, while wording of declaration on
              party relations and, particularly inclusion of even non-socialist “progressive” groups
              as eligible for consultation represents acceptance by Soviet Union of commitment to
              Yugoslav position on this point.<note n="5" xml:id="d280fn5">For text of the
                “Declaration on Relations Between Yugoslav League of Communists and the Communist

              it was forced on Soviets but reflects current Soviet policies in this field.</p>
            <p>It has been clear for some time now that Soviets had fully recognized they could no
              longer continue to rule satellite or Communist world among Stalinist lines without
              Stalin and, therefore, apparent acceptance of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s theories of relations between Communist countries and leftwing
              parties was done less as a gesture towards him than recognition on the part of Soviet
              leaders that relationships of this kind best serve Soviet interests in present phase
              of development. However, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s direct
              involvement in this process may help the furtherance of a process which logically
              should result in ending of direct Soviet control over satellites and Communist parties
              abroad. Development of this nature which at best would take considerable period of
              time may, however, not be an unalloyed advantage to non-Communist <pb n="733"
                xml:id="pg_733" facs="0761"/>world as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
              regression back in to Communist community reveals. There is in fact no reason to
              believe that the recapture of considerable measure of independence of action on the
              part of European satellites (or Communist parties abroad for that matter) would
              necessarily mean that their policies or attitudes would be more favorable to solution
              major international problems along acceptable lines, nor to any cessation of effort
              towards the “victory of socialism” in other countries.</p>
            <p>The result of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> visit, while it should not
              come as a surprise, or shock to anyone who has been following the main lines of
              development since the Belgrade visit, nevertheless does obviously pose very difficult
              problems for Western powers, particularly US. Abrupt cessation of aid, which would be
              more than justified on many grounds, nevertheless would provide basis to the Yugoslavs
              and before world opinion for charge that we had “forced” Yugoslavia into even greater
              intimacy and dependence on Soviet Union. On the other hand, continuance of aid would
              not, in my opinion, have any material effect in halting or even slowing down this
              process, since Yugoslavs undoubtedly received assurances from Soviets of large
              economic assistance. In addition, now that aberrations of Stalin period have been
              swept aside there is powerful gravitational pull between the two countries sharing as
              they do in the common Marxist-Leninist doctrine and with social, political and
              economic systems, whose similarities are greater than their differences. For immediate
              future I think we can anticipate, as <persName corresp="#p_LL1"

            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> told the Secretary that he was
              leaving on July 3 for a month’s consultation and leave in Yugoslavia and that before
              he left, his Government had wanted to let the Secretary know how much it appreciated
              the Secretary’s forthright public stand for the continuance of aid to Yugoslavia. The
              Secretary replied that he hoped he had been right in taking that stand because he had
              really stuck his neck out.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">For
                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ testimony on behalf of aid to Yugoslavia, see <hi

              Congressional committees and individual Senators and without his other efforts, the
              prohibition of any further aid to Yugoslavia would undoubtedly have been adopted by an
              overwhelming vote. He added that his confidence that Yugoslavia would not take orders
              or guidance from Moscow or be in the Soviet camp stemmed from his talks with <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName> last November.<note n="3"
                xml:id="d281fn3">See <ref target="#d263">Documents 263</ref>–<ref target="#d265"
                  >265</ref>.</note> If he were proved wrong on this, his stock in Congress would
              certainly sink, so that a big risk was involved. He had asked Ambassador <persName
                corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> to see <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> to get confirmation that the analysis of Yugoslavia’s position made
              by the Secretary was correct.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador said that he had not yet received detailed information from Belgrade
              about what had transpired in Moscow, but from what he knew he believed that the visit
              to Russia had given <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> a chance to make
              personal observations of Soviet developments on the basis of which <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was now satisfied that real and seriously
              intended changes were in progress. The trip had also strengthened the general position
              of independence of Yugoslavia. To the Secretary’s question about developments in the
              position of independence of the satellites, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ML1"
                >Mates</persName> replied that it was the Yugoslav impression, reinforced by what
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> saw in Rumania, that more and more
              independence was taking hold in both external and internal affairs in those
              countries.</p>
            <p>He continued that U.S.-Yugoslav relations should in no way be affected by all this
              and referred the Secretary to Yugoslav Vice President <persName corresp="#p_KE1"
                >Kardelj</persName>’s article in the latest issue of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                Affairs</hi> for an exposition of Yugoslavia’s views about this.<note n="4"
                xml:id="d281fn4">The article, entitled “Evolution in Jugoslavia,” was published in
                the July 1956 issue of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs,</hi> pp. 580–602.</note>
              The Secretary stated that it would help if there were some aspect of foreign policy
              where Yugoslavia agreed with the U.S. instead of with the USSR. Some people held this
              to be more than a coincidence. The Ambassador observed that the similarity was
              apparent, but that the Yugoslavs had long held to these positions and that it was the
              Soviets who had shifted in the Yugoslav direction. The Secretary reiterated that it
              would nevertheless <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0763"/>be helpful if the
              Yugoslavs could review their views and find some little point—not necessarily very
              important—where they were not in agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ML1"
                >Mates</persName> thought that since the Yugoslavs formulated their stands on the
              basis of their own interests, they could not be expected to change them just because
              the Russians seemed to have joined them. He recalled, moreover, that in the UN, the
              Yugoslavs had not voted with the Soviets a number of times—most recently when they
              abstained on the Soviet-backed Arab proposal to inscribe the Algerian question on the
              Security Council agenda. The Secretary noted that this was the kind of divergence he
              had in mind and that it was useful, since a pattern of complete coincidence might be
              interpreted as having been planned in advance.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> said that he wished to stress
              that material aid was not the basis of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S., but
              the Congressional minority had put the aid question into a political context and
              wished to sever all friendly relations between the two countries. For this reason, the
              Yugoslav Government welcomed the Secretary’s stand so greatly, for, as he had said, it
              was incredible that a country (Yugoslavia) which had sacrificed so much for its
              independence should now voluntarily return to a subservient status. The Secretary
              repeated that he drew his confidence from what <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal
                Tito</persName> had said on Brioni.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> observed that this did not mean that
              the Yugoslavs thought that developments in the Eastern European countries were tending
              toward American or Western European style governments. The Secretary said that he
              agreed fully. The post-World War I idea of a cordon sanitaire of hostile states around
              the Soviet Union was completely outmoded. The USSR was a major power entitled to have
              friendly governments surrounding it, such as Finland and Yugoslavia. The situation in
              Europe would be much healthier if there were independent states friendly to Russia
              around Russia instead of servile or dependent states. The U.S. objected to the
              extension of virtual Soviet sovereignty to the center of Europe. Soviet frontiers,
              expanded after World War II, took care of all of Russia’s legitimate needs, and
              Central Europe needed independent governments and not the projection of Soviet
              sovereignty into the area. After the Ambassador agreed with this and noted that
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had voiced similar views to the
              Secretary, the latter continued that he assumed <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> had not changed his feelings on this. A situation could not
              continue where the USSR used countries long accustomed to independence as pawns for
              Soviet aims. The Polish uprising was an example of how the Russians are exploiting the
              satellites so as to be able to make generous offers to the Middle and Far Eastern
              countries. The satellite peoples took pride in their traditions of independent
              national existence. Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary used to have higher standards
              of living, and an <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0764"/>unhealthy situation would
              persist until pride and self-rule were restored to these nations. <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had shown the way, and the countries of the area
              should be and, indeed, had to be friendly to Russia if a similarly unhealthy situation
              in reverse were not to develop.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> noted that the emergence of
              hostile states would just create new world tensions. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> felt that new developments in the Secretary’s sense in Eastern
              Europe were underway, and the world might soon see further signs of this. The
              Secretary pointed out, however, that if the Soviets did not alter the situation
              quickly enough, independence might come to the satellites under conditions in which
              hostility to the USSR was the dominant note. This happened when rulers held on too
              long and was similar to the same problem in another form, namely, Western colonialism.
              Britain had known when to leave India, and their relations were now better than ever
              before. France, however, had tried to hold on too long in Indo-China and, perhaps, in
              North Africa, too. The British position in Cyprus was also in peril, and the Soviets
              could suffer the same fate in Eastern Europe if they delayed too long. The Ambassador
              said that he thought the Soviets were aware of the element of timing and would act in
              good time.</p>

                      arrangement with Moscow for partnership in the Soviet Bloc may have been made.

                      discounted.” [Footnote in the source text.]</p></note> (Paras. 7–8)</p></item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Despite increased cooperation and the likelihood of even closer ties between
                Yugoslavia and the USSR, it is unlikely at least for some time to come that
                  <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will associate himself formally with
                the Bloc. However, he will almost certainly seek to develop closer ties with the
                Satellites and will almost certainly side with the USSR on most major international
                issues. In particular, he will almost certainly be a willing and active exponent of
                policies designed to promote popular fronts, to woo the neutralist nations, to
                spread the concept of coexistence, and to gain converts for the Soviet stand on
                disarmament and European security. (Paras. 18–20)</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>US ability to influence Yugoslav policy—never decisive at its strongest—has
                sharply declined and will probably continue to do so. It is unlikely that either a
                continuation of US aid or a threat to cut it off would restrain <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> from continuing to build up his ties with the
                Communist world. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                continues to look to the US for aid (notably substantial amounts of wheat and spare
                parts for US military equipment) and probably believes that the US will feel
                compelled to meet these requests in some degree to keep him from moving even closer
                to the Bloc. If he considered that the loss of US aid were imminent, he might make
                gestures to mollify the West but would probably not fundamentally alter his policy.

                continuing, and perhaps expanding, Soviet-Yugoslav rapprochement, one U.S.
                short-term objective—the maintenance by Yugoslavia of its political independence—has
                been realized up to now. However, Yugoslav willingness to accept and to become
                dependent on large amounts of Soviet bloc economic aid and to enter into expanding
                trade relationships cannot be overlooked and presents an increasing danger to
                Yugoslavia’s political independence. Denial of U.S. loan and grant assistance in the
                economic and, to a lesser extent, in the military fields may force Yugoslavia to
                turn further to the USSR as the only available alternative source for such help,
                thereby increasing the threat to Yugoslavia’s political independence.</item>
              <label>b.</label>
              <item><p><hi rend="italic">Influence on the Soviet Bloc.</hi> Yugoslav interest
                  appears undiminished in enhancing its own position of political and ideological
                  influence in Eastern Europe, which, in turn, leads the Yugoslavs cautiously but
                  persistently to seek to promote an evolution of the Soviet satellites toward
                  greater independence from Moscow. However, since these efforts are largely cloaked
                  in secrecy and since results can only occasionally be deduced from events, it is
                  still impossible to estimate the extent of Yugoslav success and Western benefits
                  therefrom. An example of this obscurity is furnished by the fall of <persName
                    corresp="#p_RM1">Rakosi</persName>, in which development, according to the
                  American Legation in Budapest, Yugoslav example and behind-the-scenes influence
                  had a part.</p>
                <p>When the Yugoslavs deal with bloc developments on an overt basis, their attitude
                  becomes, if anything, harder to evaluate. The first Yugoslav newspaper stories
                  dealing with the Poznan riots followed the Soviet and Polish line that they were
                  caused by “foreign agents.” But when the Polish line diverged from the Soviet
                  line—the Poles maintaining that the riots, although not good in themselves, were
                  justified by hardships and shortages, while the Soviets maintained the “foreign
                  agent” theory—the Yugoslavs followed the Polish line. It appears that the
                  Yugoslavs, in supporting the Polish stress on <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742"
                    facs="0770"/>the necessity for improvement of Polish living conditions, in
                  opposition to the Soviet line, aimed to encourage the effort of the Polish
                  Communist government to assert some independence and to improve living
                  conditions—within the framework of Communism.</p>
                <p>This event tends to illustrate both the strength and weakness of Yugoslav
                  influence on the bloc. Because they are Communists, the Yugoslavs can get a
                  hearing among those Communist ruling groups who desire improved living conditions
                  and greater national autonomy. But because they are Communists, the Yugoslavs dare
                  not espouse causes and movements which would threaten Communism itself.</p>
                <p>In comparison with the other objectives set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                    >NSC</gloss> 5601, that of para. 15 appears in a relatively favorable light. The
                  importance of Yugoslavia in the eyes of the Soviet bloc states of Eastern Europe
                  may be measured in part by the inordinate amount of attention and economic aid
                  given Yugoslavia by the Soviet bloc.<note n="5" xml:id="d285fn5">See Annex

                  The visit of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to Moscow (para. 6) has
                  resulted in a virtual identity of Soviet and Yugoslav foreign policies on many key
                  issues, and there is no prospect for any substantial change for the better.
                  Yugoslavia’s “neutralist” line also sets an example for other countries which is
                  contrary to U.S. interests. However, Yugoslavia’s aim appears to be to reconcile
                  differences between East and West in the interest of arriving at a less tense and
                  less clearly divided world which may be safer for small powers, such as
                  Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most significant deterioration shown during the reporting period has
                  been Yugoslavia’s willingness—as implied in <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"

                  willingness to flout one of the central tenets of Western policy. It seems to do
                  so from a combination of Communist sympathy with the G.D.R. regime, opportunistic
                  economic interest, and a covert desire (shared by many other Europeans, Communist
                  and nonCommunist alike) to see Germany remain divided.</p></item>

              lever against the Soviet bloc, is not yet clear. However, an outright denial of U.S.

                    >GDR</gloss> for the development of 50,000 tons of aluminum capacity over a
                  5-year period starting [in] 1957 with the promise of a subsequent agreement for an
                  additional 50,000 tons. The terms and ultimate significance of this agreement are
                  by no means clear. Information on the agreement has been fragmentary and often
                  contradictory. The arrangement seems to call for participation by both the USSR
                  and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, with the USSR furnishing 1,000,000
                  tons of wheat (and/or other commodities) for local sale and dinar financing of
                  internal costs, and with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>

                  needed to obtain imported equipment and technical assistance.</p>
                <p>Shortly prior to this agreement, the Yugoslavs circulated a prospectus, inviting
                  Western participation with Yugoslavia in the development of a combined
                  hydroelectric and aluminum project. The West Europeans were to supply foreign
                  exchange needs while the U.S. was asked to enter a 5-year wheat supply agreement
                  with the Yugoslavs to provide local currency and to meet Yugoslav food needs. It
                  is not clear now whether the announced Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                  >GDR</gloss>-Yugoslav agreement is in addition to, or part of, the 165,000 tons of
                  aluminum capacity envisaged in the prospectus. Until this situation is clarified
                  Western consideration of the Yugoslav plan is unlikely.</p>
                <p>In addition to the serious policy question of virtually entering into a long-term
                  partnership with the Soviet bloc in developing Yugoslavia’s power and aluminum
                  potential involving commitments on both sides over a considerable period, U.S.
                  officials have serious reservations about its claimed future benefits to
                  Yugoslavia’s balance of payments position and its implied dismissal of any attempt
                  to create a self-supporting agriculture in Yugoslavia.</p></item>

              development there had been a flood of intelligence material alleging new and serious
              rifts over the Yugoslav problem among the Soviet leaders. It was the burden of many of
              these reports that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was now
              completely isolated in support of the new and more liberal approach to Yugoslavia.
              Certain Yugoslav sources were insisting that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName>’s opponents are arguing that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s policies are dangerously weakening the control of the USSR over
              its satellites. Whatever the precise truth of all these rumors, <persName

                >CIA</gloss> believed that recent Soviet policy toward the satellites had given rise
              to concern and that the Soviet leaders believed they will now have to shift their
              course and again tighten their controls. On the other hand, <persName
                corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName> pointed out that <persName

                >Mikoyan</persName> had been at least as closely associated with the new policy of
              liberalism toward the satellites as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
              himself. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName> was
              inclined to doubt if there existed any genuine crisis in the top Soviet
              leadership.</p>
            <p>[Here follows discussion of a subject unrelated to Yugoslavia.]</p>
            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> informed the Council
              apropos of <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName>’s comments on
              Yugoslavia, that the Yugoslav Finance Minister had informed him yesterday of the
              details of the recently announced Soviet loan to Yugoslavia. It developed in point of
              fact that there was not a single dime of cash in the loan. It all consisted of goods
              and services. Accordingly, the Yugoslavs expect to turn to the United States and the
              Western Powers for a loan in hard cash.</p>
            <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_CLGCP1">General Cabell</persName> announced to
              the Council that the press ticker carried the news that all the top Soviet leaders had
              flown to the Black Sea area to meet with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Governor <persName

            <p>I recalled that the President was expected to make his “findings” under the Mutual
              Security legislation by the 16th. I said that the Department had been intensively
              studying the matter for some time, and I had been giving it much thought and that
              there was a unanimity of view that the President’s findings should be affirmative.</p>
            <p>I said that we did not know as much as we would like to know about the recent talks
              of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName>. However I remained convinced that the Government of
              Yugoslavia was independent in the sense of not being subject to dictation by the
              Soviet Government or the Soviet Communist Party; that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> jealously safeguarded this independence and that this view was
              shared by a majority at least of the Yugoslav Communist Party; that there was perhaps
              not the same need for building up Yugoslav military strength as had been the case
              heretofore, but that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was determined as a
              matter of pride to have some jet planes and would get them from Russia if not from us;
              and finally that the food situation in Yugoslavia was so desperate that unless we
              could quickly supply them with grain, they might have to go on their knees to Moscow
              and then might indeed lose their independence.</p>
            <p>I went on to say it seemed to me that in the main our policy of backing <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was paying off in terms of an increasing desire
              on the part of the satellites for independence from Moscow. There was evidence of
              considerable strains in this respect and of differences between <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and Moscow and as between the Soviet leadership
              themselves. It would, I felt, be a great misfortune to our whole policy for Eastern
              Europe if <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was forced to capitulate to
              Moscow under economic pressures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
              pointed out that the present legislation was so drastic that unless the President made
              an affirmative finding, everything in the pipeline would have to be cut off and even
                <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0777"/>our assistance to a number of Yugoslav
              students who are in this country under an exchange program—they would be left
              stranded.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> and I pointed out that there had
              been some suspension of any important military aid since Congress had acted last July
              and that this suspension could probably be continued for the time being without
              dangerous consequences, although the same was not true of the economic aid.</p>
            <p>The President said he quite agreed that the facts justified affirmative findings.
              Commenting on the military aid, he said that the great importance of our giving that
              aid was that then the recipient became dependent upon United States ammunition and
              spare parts, and it would be much better if Yugoslavia had that relation with us
              rather than with Soviet Russia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> also
              pointed to the value of our having a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in
              Yugoslavia which of course would be cut off if we cut off all military aid.</p>
            <p>I said that we were drafting findings along the line we had discussed, and I would
              expect to transmit them formally very soon. I thought it desirable that his report to
              Congress be finalized within the next day or two so that some of the Congressional
              leaders could be told of it in advance.</p>

              Following general discussion subject with President, Secretary has sent to White House
              suggested finding and report to Congress re Section 143. At news conference Oct

              President stated he would make decision at last minute on basis latest data but that
              some announcement would be made on issue Oct 16. In brief, proposed text refers to
              Congressional criteria and then states that “I (President) hereby find and report to
              Congress affirmatively with respect <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0778"/>to the
              three matters”. First reason given for President’s decision is that our Yugoslav
              policy has been based not on approval of or affinity with internal policies of regime
              but on our decision that US interests required support for independence Yugoslavia in
              face Soviet threat. Balance available evidence indicates that Yugoslavia still
              independent of Soviet control and wishes remain so, that Soviets still trying
              compromise that independence, and that some American aid still needed and wanted by
              Yugoslavs. This is true despite fact that Soviet designs against Yugoslavia are now
              more subtle and perhaps not adequately appreciated or defended against by
              Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>Second reason relates to finding that ideology and doctrine of Yugoslav Communist
              Party seem to follow concept that each nation should decide for self nature of own
              society and that there should not be interference by one nation in affairs of other.
              Third reason states that there is danger that without US aid Yugoslavia will be unable
              maintain independence. Moreover US policies begun 1949 to enable maintenance
              independence remain valid.</p>
            <p>Report then notes that President’s action while meeting statutory requirement will
              have primary immediate effect of clearing way for conversations with Yugoslavs to
              examine various possibilities for bilateral cooperation in economic field. In military
              field US has since enactment Section 143 followed policy of permitting only small,
              routine and long-planned deliveries of equipment. “I (President) intend that this
              attitude, which implies non-delivery of jet planes and other items of heavy equipment,
              shall be maintained until situation can be more accurately appraised during days to
              come.” However it is now prudent and wise proceed with economic aid for people of
              Yugoslavia primarily in form foodstuffs.</p>
            <p>Paper concludes with acknowledgement that it does not definitely settle US-Yugoslav
              relations which will remain under constant review with periodic reference to criteria
              of Section 143 to ensure present decision remains justified in future. Furthermore
              this determination is not mandate for expenditure of funds but restores discretion to
              Executive Branch to act in accord with national policy and interest. This approach
              will serve foreign policy interests and simultaneously protect against unwise
              expenditure public funds. (<hi rend="italic">End of summary of report</hi>)</p>

            <head>290. Editorial Note</head>
            <p>On October 16, the President released his decision relative to Section 143 of the
              Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, which provided for the suspension of aid to
              Yugoslavia pending the evaluation by the President of Yugoslavia’s attitude toward the
              West. The President’s findings were sent in identical letters to the President of the
              Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. In these letters, the
              President stated that he had decided to resume assistance to Yugoslavia because of his
              conviction that Yugoslavia remained independent of the Soviet Union, and was not
              participating in any program for Communist conquest of the world. The President also
              remained convinced that it was in the national security interests of the United States
              to continue to assist Yugoslavia. Accordingly, the President ordered that economic
              aid, in the form of shipments of foodstuffs, be resumed. The policy of non-delivery of
              jet planes and other heavy equipment items would be maintained, pending further
              clarification of Yugoslav policies. The President cautioned that these determinations
              merely restored discretion to the President on the matter of aid to Yugoslavia, and
              that aid would be continued only if it remained in the interest of the United States.

                was subjected to considerable interpretation. He said he would like my comment on
                press release first, particularly as it represented Yugoslav Government viewpoint on
                President’s report which while welcome in some respects had given certain shock in
                others. I then spoke along following lines.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Press release in my opinion could be criticized primarily on grounds
                inconsistency and inaccuracy on certain points. If Yugoslav Government found certain
                sections letter unpalatable or even unacceptable, it should recall first that
                President had made affirmative response to three points. In view highly generalized
                information hitherto given us re Yugoslav-Soviet relations and recent developments
                it was not unnatural United States should have some reserves on ultimate Soviet
                aims. Seriousness of developments at Brioni and apparent Soviet intention to reverse
                line laid down in Moscow declaration had been emphasized to us only by Yugoslav
                Government and in particular by <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> in our
                conversation October 1 (Embassy telegram 437, paragraphs 3 and 4).<note n="3"

                    target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/10–156)</note> Subsequently little information had
                been offered how this “wide gap” had been bridged at Yalta and we were still unaware
                what compromise had been arrived at. I said threats to independence could take
                various forms and Tempo, in course of wheat discussions, had underlined danger for
                Yugoslavia in becoming too dependent on USSR in trade relations. Therefore I found
                lack of logic in contention of no threat to Yugoslav independence by Soviet Union.
                Yugoslav Government desire for long-term economic arrangements was of course
                well-known to us but this raised several problems which we had discussed lengthily
                with Tempo. I reminded <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> we had extended
                under authorization stipulated by law and further I had told Tempo only recently
                question of long-term credits would naturally raise same type political issues with
                which we now concerned. Furthermore generalized Yugoslav proposals to date envisaged
                sale of surplus agricultural products under long-term credits <pb n="753"
                  xml:id="pg_753" facs="0781"/>eventually payable “in dollars or some other
                currency”. Emphasis seemed to be on latter which raised host of problems. Perhaps
                next year administration would have new proposals to present to Congress but at
                present we must operate under existing laws.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Re statement on military aid, I could only remark release was inaccurate and
                quoted figures mentioned Embassy telegram 500, paragraph 4 amplifying these with
                numerous illustrations on variety of deliveries in addition to spare parts.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> said would try explain Yugoslav
                Government position in existing circumstances. Difficult accept President’s report
                without comment; although Yugoslav Government knows aid given under United States
                laws, it thinks situation now greatly changed. President had in effect repeated what
                was formerly true but it no longer corresponds to facts, i.e., danger from Soviet
                Union has lessened or is disappearing. Yugoslav Government is attempting to find
                balance between East and West which is different from Presidential formulation which
                implies Yugoslavia in same danger as five years ago. Yugoslav Government does not
                want to be bound to one side and would be difficult for it to admit it accepting aid
                on basis danger from Soviet Union. These formulations therefore offensive to
                Yugoslav Government which is striving for good economic relations with both sides.
                Also mention of possibility of cutting off aid worries Yugoslav Government as it
                places it in position insecurity for future while its duty must be provide food for
                its people. Yugoslav Government hopes US will therefore understand its motives in
                accepting aid, and its standpoint is set forth in press release.</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> then said Yugoslav Government in
                difficult position on wheat. It wants to plan for more than one year’s supply and
                with United States it cannot be certain in view of President’s letter whether it can
                count on more than one year. (I interrupted to say our record of covering deficits
                spoke for itself and <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> admitted this was
                true.) He said he would be entirely frank about present status of negotiations with
                USSR. Soviet system was rigid as was based on state planning and Soviets were
                demanding to know Yugoslav requirements for 4 to 5 years ahead before concluding
                agreements. Yugoslav Government had postponed and was still postponing decision on
                this because it wanted to investigate again possibility of longer term arrangements
                with United States for agricultural surpluses. He referred to our recent agreement
                with India as example of what Yugoslav Government had in mind and it hoped very much
                we would examine some such possibilities for them. He entered strong plea on basis
                necessity Yugoslav Government plan future economic development, assure food supply
                over next 4 to 5 years, remove friction from our economic relations and put them on
                some loan or credit basis as not to cause such criticism in Congress. Although he
                  <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0782"/>understood limitations under which we
                worked he hoped we could give some indication of our attitude when we commenced

            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am indeed grateful for your message
              of August twenty-sixth<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">See <ref target="#d284fn2">footnote
                  2, Document 284</ref>.</note> expressing your views on various questions which
              directly concern both of our countries. Events have moved rapidly since then and it
              does not seem appropriate to discuss in detail the concrete problems of our bilateral
              relations in the economic and military fields about which you wrote me. This is not
              because these matters are not important to both our countries, but because I think
              they are, or soon will be, on their way to a mutually satisfactory solution through
              negotiations or conversations in regular channels between our Governments.</p>
            <p>I am sure we can agree that the cordial relations between our two countries are due,
              above all else, to our common stand in favor of national sovereignty, independence and
              non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. Our two countries have also
              supported international cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world. Because
              we both adhere to these principles, we have seen that our relations can serve as proof
              that dissimilar governments can not only respect each other but also work
              together.</p>
            <p>With respect to the dramatic yet tragic events in Eastern Europe, I am reminded of
              what Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> told me of his
              conversations with you a year ago<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">See <ref target="#d263"
                  >Documents 263</ref>–<ref target="#d265">265</ref>.</note> and I have observed how
              well those <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0783"/>discussions anticipated current
              trends. Many of the favorable developments can be credited, I am sure, to the personal
              efforts which I understand you made in Belgrade in 1955 and in Moscow in 1956 to
              persuade the Soviet leaders to engage themselves not to interfere in the internal
              affairs of other countries.</p>
            <p>Until set back by ruthless full-scale Soviet intervention in Hungary, this trend
              seemed to open up the possibility of creating better conditions in Eastern Europe.
              Much now depends on the course of action adopted by the Soviet Union. Our concern at
              conditions in Eastern Europe in the last decade has been caused not alone by social
              and economic conditions there or by ideological practices. Our greatest concern has
              arisen from the Soviet domination exercised over most of the area and from the
              totalitarian rule of suppression of freedom which has accompanied it. This extension
              of Soviet power into the heart of Europe poses a grave threat to the security of the
              whole world.</p>
            <p>Tensions in Europe cannot really and permanently be relaxed until the Soviet Union
              has retired to its frontiers and released Eastern Europe from its grip. The events in
              Hungary show that desperation may lead a defenseless people to rebel against an
              oppressive regime which they know has the means for forceful suppression. But I want
              to assure you that our policy has never been to encourage or induce such revolt by any
              people. Independence for these nations does not preclude the Soviet Union’s having
              friendly neighbors on its frontiers, but should facilitate this result. It seems to me
              inevitable that the area will develop into one of hatred for Russia instead of one of
              peace unless the Soviet Union makes a constructive contribution conforming with the
              true desires of the people.</p>
            <p>You may be assured that the United States does not seek to derive any special benefit
              or to impose its concepts on these lands. As I announced in my broadcast to the
              American Nation on October thirty-first,<note n="4" xml:id="d292fn4">For text of the
                President’s address, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the
                  United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>,
                  1956,</hi> p. 1060.</note> we have, with respect to the Soviet Union, sought to
              remove any fears that we would look upon any government in the Eastern Europe
              countries as potential military allies. I said that we had no such ulterior purpose
              and that we see these people as friends and wish simply that they be friends who are
              free. I have also made it clear, with the Yugoslav example in mind, that the United
              States stands ready to furnish assistance without political conditions to those people
              in Eastern Europe who have started on the path to true national independence.</p>
            <p>I believe these views accord with your own. While very much regretting that
              Yugoslavia in the United Nations was unable to take a <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756"
                facs="0784"/>stand on some phases involved in Soviet repression of the Hungarian
              people, we welcome your Government’s support for the United Nations’ action requesting
              immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. I also think you can take
              satisfaction from the fact that your efforts have consistently been in the direction
              of greater independence for the Eastern European countries. Efforts of this kind will
              be needed all the more because of the consequences produced in Hungary by a reversal
              of this trend and because of Soviet pressures being exerted on the new Polish
              Government. I believe I appreciate something at least of the difficulties the current
              situation has created for your Government.</p>
            <p>I have been happy to note the appreciation shown by your Delegation at the United
              Nations of the role the United States has been playing with respect to the Middle East
              crisis. I hope we may be able to count upon your country’s support of action by the
              United Nations which will restore peace to the area.</p>
            <p>It has occurred to me that although we have exchanged views on developments on a
              number of occasions through letters between us, this has hardly been an adequate
              substitute for a personal contact. It would give me great pleasure if you could find
              it convenient and agreeable to visit me in Washington sometime during the coming year.
              I would suggest that a suitable date could be arranged by our respective ambassadors
              through diplomatic channels.</p>

            <p>2. Foreign Secretary said he fully realized it impossible to avoid publicity if
              regular shipments resumed. While he thought it unfortunate shipments had been
              suspended, there had been a difference of political appreciation and we had to deal
              with facts as they are. He would not try to give me definite answer today as in such

              and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. He had three personal observations

            <p>3. With these points as background Foreign Secretary said he was happy for
              opportunity to consult re military aid. He said that in spite of remarks of Yugoslav
              military to <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">Waters</persName> there was growing feeling
              in top military circles that Yugoslavia should henceforth rely more on own efforts and
              less on foreign aid, although he was first to pay tribute to great assistance US had
              given in critical days. Difficulties which had arisen in execution of <gloss
                target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> and uncertainties of deliveries (although he
              recognized there were many technical difficulties involved) had created great planning
              difficulties for Yugoslav defense. Questions such as licenses and future spare parts
              deliveries had never been resolved and our frequent inability to give definite
              information on deliveries had led to growing inclination in Yugoslav Government to
              look for different solution.</p>
            <p>4. I made appropriate replies to this not forgetting to mention fact that Yugoslav
              Government had never replied to our proposal for conference to discuss future military
              aid and indeed <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> had suggested that whole
              subject be held in abeyance.</p>
            <p>5. Foreign Secretary did not contest this but remarked there was another approach.
              Yugoslav Government attached greatest importance to its proposals for long-term
              economic aid which he sincerely hoped we would view favorably. If it were possible to
              be assured of this kind of support, which involved largely agricultural surpluses for
              us, that would free other resources for defense purposes, would eliminate past
              friction and would hasten solution of pressing economic problems. He thought that
              thanks to arrangements concluded in November, we now had time to consider these
              proposals. He concluded by reiterating he was speaking personally and he would revert
              to question of military aid after he had opportunity for high-level consultation
              within Yugoslav Government.</p>
            <p>6. I reminded Foreign Secretary that only existing authority for long-term economic
              arrangements was <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 on which there was a ceiling
              and under which many requests were already pending. As he knew there were exhaustive
              studies now under way re future aid and I anticipated administration would make
              recommendations to Congress where final decision would lie. It was impossible now for
              me to make any firm predictions, but importance of such groups as Fairless
                Committee<note n="3" target="d294fn3">Reference is the the President’s Citizen

                programs.</note> was obvious and I was happy to note he and <persName

            <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0787"/>
            <p>7. I find it difficult to believe Yugoslav Government losing interest <gloss

              has been no indication this from military side. Two theories are possible: <list>
                <label>(A)</label>
                <item>Hungarian revolt has impressed upon Yugoslav Government necessity raising
                  living standards to assuage growing discontent and therefore less emphasis (and
                  less money) will be given to defense and more to civilian production thereby
                  reducing interest in military aid.</item>
                <label>(B)</label>
                <item>Resumption of deliveries presents at this stage, particularly if <persName

                  Soviets on Hungary, very real problem of timing for Yugoslavs. Soviets may be
                  insisting on some loosening Yugoslav military ties with US as price for
                  concessions in Hungary. I think we agree here and in Department loosening ties has

            <p>[Here follows discussion of subjects unrelated to Yugoslavia.] There was considerable
              discussion regarding the projected visit of President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>. The Secretary outlined the reasons for the visit, mentioning the
              opposition on the part of Catholic elements in the United States which has been
              aroused by recent publicity on the <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0788"/>subject.
              He mentioned that he had heard that <persName corresp="#p_MEC1">Cardinal
                Mooney</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2"><persName corresp="#p_MEC1">Edward
                  Cardinal Mooney</persName>, Archbishop of Detroit.</note> for example was
              outspoken in this regard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> mentioned
              a message sent to him recently by the Catholic Bishops of America meeting in
              Washington, who expressed concern.</p>
            <p>The Secretary stressed that the suggested state visit was not sentimental in
              character but designed to further American objectives and policies. <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> represents a force in the satellite area which
              has been working in a direction desired by us and causing a deterioration of the
              Soviet stranglehold in that area. Inviting him obviously does not mean we approve of
              all things that the Yugoslav Government stands for. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> said that an explanation along these lines had been given to the
              Catholic Bishops.</p>
            <p>The President thought that we might stimulate through our Ambassador in Belgrade some
              gesture favorable to Catholics on the part of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> before he comes here. The Secretary mentioned <persName
                corresp="#p_SAC1">Cardinal Stepinac</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d295fn3">See <ref
                  target="#d265fn2">footnote 2, Document 265</ref>.</note> and it was explained that
                <persName corresp="#p_SAC1">Stepinac</persName> had been in prison, although he is
              now restricted to his native village where he is allowed to function as a priest, but
              not to carry on his duties as Cardinal. The President said with some asperity that
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> should make some gesture improving this
              condition as the President understood there was strong feeling in this country on the
              part of the Croatian and Slovene groups in this respect. Perhaps our Ambassador in
              Belgrade could discuss this at a suitable occasion and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> might refer to the problem in conversation with <persName
                corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName>. The President said he felt we should not be too
              squeamish in explaining to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> that we have
              our own problems in this country and that while we would defer to him on matters of
              strictly internal concern, it would be best for him to understand the actual situation
              prevailing in this country. The President referred to the fact that there are from 30
              to 40 million Catholics in the United States and that our views on the subject of
              freedom of religion are well known to everybody. Both the President and the Secretary
              expressed reservations regarding <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit
              and the President said he did not mind if <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
              was told that these difficulties exist, and unless he were willing to make some effort
              to cooperate, the President said in effect we might have to reserve action on this
              item.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that after our Ambassadors notify us in each case that the visits can
              be made at a certain specified time, we would then make a public announcement
              including a list of names of those who had been invited to visit the United States
              during 1957. It would be added that the exact dates are being worked out.</p>

                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> visit has as anticipated aroused considerable
              opposition domestically, most important but not sole source of which is American
              Catholic organizations and their adherents. Following discussion of details of trip by
              President and Secretary, they agreed visit suitable around end March or start April.
              However they believed that US domestic political situation should be explained
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and that he should show understanding
              our position by making appropriate move on Yugoslav domestic scene (perhaps on behalf
                <persName corresp="#p_SAC1">Cardinal Stepinac</persName>) which would mollify
              American opposition groups. At same time, in view well-known <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> recalcitrance in face foreign pressures and
              necessity for <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> take account of hostility
              felt by dominant Serbian population group towards <persName corresp="#p_SAC1"
                >Stepinac</persName>, it is clear that unless delicately handled such approach could
              cause serious deterioration US-Yugoslav relations and damage to US policy Eastern
              Europe. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
            <p>Suggest following line for approach:</p>
            <p>President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> have discussed
              specific timing and program of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> visit.
              They suggest <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> arrive Washington about
              March 26, remain three days, and then [spend] up to about week traveling around
              country, especially West Coast. This time most convenient here and strongly hope
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> could conform this schedule.</p>
            <p>At same time both consider it desirable apprise <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName> in all frankness of domestic US reaction to unfortunate premature
              leak of story to press. As <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> indicated in
              his August 26 letter to President,<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">See <ref
                  target="#d284fn2">footnote 2, Document 284</ref>.</note> he is aware of long
              history of opposition by certain members of Congress who represent sizable number of
              citizens to our policy towards Yugoslavia. These groups particularly lay Catholic
              organizations have raised loud cry against visit. They have alleged Yugoslav regime
              discrimination against Catholic Church and have especially contrasted <pb n="762"
                xml:id="pg_762" facs="0790"/>recent Polish developments in this field (such as new
              status <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Cardinal Wyszynski</persName>)<note n="4"

                Government in 1953, but restored in 1956.</note> with conditions Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>US has of course followed policy of scrupulously avoiding official mention these
              matters which pertain to Yugoslav internal affairs. However President and Secretary
              both anxious have visit proceed smoothly and successfully as possible. They certainly
              would want avoid mass picketing and protests which have been threatened in certain
              major cities where Catholics and citizens of East European descent make up important
              element of population. While such demonstrations would not be allowed involve safety
              of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> party, while they could be kept away
              from his line of travel (particularly if he did not visit sensitive cities), and while
              we would seek discourage them by official statements and actions, their occurrence in
              lawful manner might not be wholly preventable and they would tend mar visit in way we
              would consider most unfortunate.</p>
            <p>Accordingly and without any thoughts of own on subject, President and Secretary
              suggest that Yugoslavs might examine situation to see whether it feasible for
                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> or regime make some gesture at
              appropriate time between now and visit which would tend mollify American opposition
              groups and create atmosphere good feeling throughout this country. We would be happy
              discuss this further with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> during
              conversations on detailed planning for visit.</p>

                surprise to Yugoslav Government although vigor of reaction to trip may have been
                more than anticipated. When Foreign Secretary informed me of decision on January 28,
                he implied very clearly it would be postponement and made no mention of any
                publicity and in fact, on January 11<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">In telegram 994

                and his trip (June 1956), there seems to have been no necessity for such sudden
                publicity cancelling trip. We cannot therefore exclude possibility there was some
                ulterior motive, although growing intensity of ideological clash between Yugoslavs
                and Soviets would seem to militate against likelihood there any collusion between
                the two.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>Yugoslav exceeding sensitivity at unfavorable United States publicity would seem
                illogical and inconsistent when compared with their attitude toward anti-Yugoslav
                propaganda from Moscow. Only recently when I made some passing reference to
                virulence of Soviet radio propaganda against United States, I received long lecture
                from Foreign Secretary how those who work for peace and relaxation of tension should
                rise above such attacks and should pursue their mission without regard to
                vituperation. And certainly Yugoslav publicity and official attitude on United
                States Near East policy has not been characterized by any inhibitions. Therefore as
                I regard manner in which Yugoslav Government forced cancellation, I am impelled to
                conclusion <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> did not desire to make visit
                at this time. I have subsequently found out that following hunting party on January

                  <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> kept his principal collaborators
                until 3 a.m. and I suspect decision to publicize cancellation of trip was taken that
                night. This was followed by return to Belgrade of Yugoslav Ambassador to Moscow
                following conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and
                Italian Ambassador is informed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>

                United Kingdom Ambassador that Soviets had promised sufficient coking coal under
                trade agreement. (While these two comments are superficially in conflict with report

            <p>2. At present all military aid is suspended except training, local <gloss
                target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>, and spare parts and maintenance items necessary to
              ensure continued effectiveness of previously delivered equipment. This suspension
              which commenced last summer has without doubt led to confusion, uncertainty and
              misunderstanding on part of Yugoslavia military, particularly in view of favorable
              presidential determination in October.<note n="5" xml:id="d299fn5">See <ref
                  target="#d290">Document 290</ref>.</note> An example is case of three [garble] now
              ready for delivery and being held in French shipyards. Continuation of suspension not
              only imposes necessary US financial obligations for security and maintenance of craft
              that deteriorate rapidly through prolonged <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0794"
              />non-use but it confuses the Yugoslavs. The Yugoslav military does not understand the
              US position on delayed delivery of these ships while continuing work on four <gloss
                target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>
              <gloss target="#t_MSI1">MSI</gloss>’s under construction in Yugoslav yards which in
              effect indicates to Yugoslav Government planned delivery both types. Yugoslav military
              has, for several years, looked forward to acquisition of these new fleet units since
              they represent vast improvement over standard Yugoslav ships. The most useful training
              months for shaking down these ships with Yugoslav crews in local waters are ahead and
              further suspension in delivery tends to retard training.</p>
            <p>3. Turning to the Yugoslav air force it is noted that the benefit of their successful
              F–86–E training program wherein 227 pilots and 711 technicians were produced is being
              lost. The 5 flyable aircraft are insufficient to provide proficiency training for more
              than 15 pilots and 50 technicians, because of complexity and high performance type of
              aircraft. While not as acute problem, same situation exists with respect to F–84G
              aircraft where 109 are now flyable of the 132 delivered. <gloss target="#t_YAF1"
                >YAF</gloss> reports and <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss> has verified the
              number of qualified pilots and technicians available in excess of those required to
              activate the three remaining fighter-bomber (F–84G) squadrons to bring <gloss
                target="#t_YAF1">YAF</gloss> up to the planned 9 fighter-bomber squadrons contained
              in the force goal. Spare parts and equipment are available in Yugoslavia for one wing
              of 75 F–86E and are not interchangeable with other <gloss target="#t_YAF1">YAF</gloss>
              aircraft. Deterioration of spares and equipment in storage is not a serious problem
              but follows a normal course and must be expected. The delivery of these spares to
                <gloss target="#t_YAF1">YAF</gloss> has been interpreted as an indication of future
              deliveries of F–86E aircraft. Storage of programmed but undelivered aircraft is
              another problem, however, in that this “flyable storage” would be at great expense to
              the US. Yugoslavia has approximately eight months of good flying weather per year,
              most of which lies immediately ahead. The present lack of aircraft denies <gloss
                target="#t_YAF1">YAF</gloss> that training which could be executed during the
              March–October period and pushes further into the future the ultimate attainment of the
              planned force goal of providing Yugoslavia with an equipped and trained fighter-bomber
              and day fighter capability to support its conventional ground and sea forces. Over the
                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> years <gloss target="#t_YAF1">YAF</gloss> has
              provided funds and worked in an orderly fashion to have adequate ground facilities
              (seven modern jet aircraft fields), pilots and technicians prepared to receive the
              programmed aircraft. <gloss target="#t_YAF1">YAF</gloss> is now capable of absorbing
              aircraft and equipment deliveries at the maximum rate of delivery believed attainable
              by <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>.</p>
            <p>4. With respect to the ground forces the problems are neither as acute nor as
              distressing to the <gloss target="#t_YNA1">YNA</gloss>. They exist in the fields of
              suspended delivery of ammunition with its resultant fall-off of weapons training and
              in establishment of crystal repair and maintenance facilities <pb n="767"
                xml:id="pg_767" facs="0795"/>for some 250,000 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
              provided crystals. Neither is in the magnitude of the air or navy problems. However,
              Yugoslavs continue to press unceasingly for delivery of vehicles and weapons as well
              as ammunition.</p>
            <p>5. Foregoing description of technical problems facing US and Yugoslavs by continued
              suspension of deliveries represents considered views of <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1"
                >General Waters</persName> and me. We have not discussed cost to US of storage and
              related problems issuing from suspension because we are not fully informed, but we
              understand they are considerable. Pentagon no doubt has this information.</p>
            <p>6. Although we recognize this problem of resuming deliveries presents difficulties in
              Washington, I note from Deptel 701, February 26,<note n="6" xml:id="d299fn6">Not
                printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 411.6841/2–2157)</note> that Department
              expects include request <gloss target="#t_DS1">DS</gloss> funds in presentation to
              Congress and expects opposition will be less than last year. If Congressional
              situation is so improved, perhaps moment is favorable to take decision on military
              aid. Certainly current and growing Soviet-Yugoslav rift presents us with opportunity
              consolidate Yugoslav military ties with West. If we decide to lift suspension it would
              enable us to move toward completion of planned program to provide small, balanced,
              defensive force which has been mutually developed by US and Yugoslavia. Completion of
              program would at that time provide strong contrast to Soviet refusal to fulfill
              commitments in economic field and strengthen Yugoslav determination to resist Soviet
              pressure—a determination reaffirmed by <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to
              Kline on March 9.<note n="7" xml:id="d299fn7">In an interview with <persName

                stated that Yugoslavia would not rejoin the Soviet bloc, even though the refusal
                would cause economic difficulties for Yugoslavia. A summary of the conversation is
                in telegram 1250 from Belgrade, March 11. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

              of Soviet control and that U.S. objectives would, on balance, continue to be served by
              U.S. support of Yugoslavia. The finding permitted economic aid to Yugoslavia to go

              spare parts and maintenance items. (See paragraphs 3.a. and 6.)</p>

                blandishments, as it had after late 1954. The Soviets have blamed the events in
                Poland and Hungary in part on Yugoslav influence. The result has been a mounting
                Soviet bloc pressure on the Yugoslavs for ideological (and, hence, political)
                subservience to Moscow. This pressure was first manifested on an ideological level
                and exercised through speeches and editorials, but it now gives clear signs of being
                extended to the state level, where it is evidenced by the refusal of the USSR and
                East Germany to implement fully previously-granted credits and development loans.
                The Yugoslavs have indicated clearly that they do not intend to submit to this
                pressure.</item>

                reaction thereto have provided evidence of the extent of Yugoslav influence. Polish
                nationally-minded Communists have been influenced by the Yugoslav example and advice
                in their so-far successful bid for greater independence and, moreover, from all
                reports, have been greatly heartened by the fact of U.S. support for Yugoslavia and
                the nature of U.S.-Yugoslav relations. The Yugoslav example had an important role in
                encouraging those in intellectual elements which first instigated the Hungarian
                revolt with their demands for greater national and intellectual freedom.</item>

                further Soviet-Communist cold war objectives and that Yugoslav potentialities be
                developed on behalf of U.S. and other free world aims, Yugoslav foreign policies
                seem to call neither for great concern nor for enthusiastic approval. Yugoslavia has
                not recognized the (East) “German Democratic Republic,” but remains willing to
                accept economic relations with it not leading to recognition. In general, the
                neutralist bent of Yugoslav foreign policy continues as before and seems to be
                dictated by the Yugoslavs’ view of their country’s needs as a small country balanced
                between East <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0798"/>and West. Yugoslavia has
                supported United Nations actions in the Middle East, but its attitude in regard to
                UN action on Hungary has been somewhat ambiguous. While disapproving of Soviet
                intervention there in principle, Yugoslav officials have explained their abstention
                on most General Assembly votes condemning the Soviet Union by claiming that UN
                action could only exacerbate the situation, would not influence the USSR, and could
                not help Hungary in any case. Besides this rationalization of their position, the
                Yugoslavs indicated to the United States last November their apprehension about
                possible Soviet military actions against them or other nearby countries.</item>

                Yugoslav Communists have been realistic enough, apparently, to recognize the desires
                of the people for improvement in living standards and for some measure of freedom,

              17,000 Hungarian refugees in Yugoslavia. UN observers have reported that conditions of
              housing and feeding provided by the Yugoslavs are roughly comparable to Austrian
              standards. New refugee flow has been reduced to a trickle and it is unlikely that the
              number in Yugoslavia will exceed 20,000. To date, about 400 have settled permanently
              in Yugoslavia, over 250 have gone from Yugoslavia to Western countries other than the
              United States, and almost 1,800 have voluntarily returned to Hungary. The Yugoslavs
              complain that the refugees represent a heavy economic burden to them, and continue to
              press the West for financial and material assistance in caring for the refugees, as
              well as for action to remove some of the refugees to the countries of second asylum.
              No refugees will be taken directly into the U.S. from Yugoslavia on parole, at least
              until the proposed amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act have been acted
              upon. However, the Department of State is seeking to work out a plan (for which $2
              million has been allocated) for helping the Intergovernmental Committee for European
              Migration to move 10,000 Hungarians from Yugoslavia to countries of permanent
              resettlement or secondary asylum. Some U.S. assistance for interim care and
              maintenance of the refugees is also being considered.</p>
            <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Military Aid.</hi> The resumption in March 1956 of previously
              programmed deliveries, following a 10-months’ suspension, continued for less than four
              months before another partial suspension was instituted on the basis of Congressional
              hesitancy about aid for Yugoslavia. In October 1956 this partial suspension was
              extended to all items except spare parts and maintenance equipment. The Departments of
              State and Defense have reviewed this situation a number of times in recent months, and
              an early decision on a resumption of relatively normal shipments appears probable.
              Such a decision is required to avoid expensive prolonged storage of jet aircraft
              incorporated in prior programs. On the political level the Yugoslavs have requested a
              decision and on the working level Yugoslav military officers have made it apparent to
              American Military Assistance Staff officers in Belgrade that the present stoppage is
              materially affecting the tactical efficiency of the Yugoslav Air Force. A similar
              problem exists concerning three <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> minesweepers which
              have been completed for <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0800"/>the Yugoslavs in

            <p>7. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> Visit.</hi> After
              premature reports of a possible visit to the United States by <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> began circulating publicly, Congressional and
              press opposition mounted rapidly. In the face of the unfavorable atmosphere building
              up here, the Yugoslav press announced <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s
              unwillingness to visit the U.S. under such conditions, at least for the time being.
              Yugoslav officials have since expressed their disappointment at the foregoing incident
              and have pointed out that recent attempts by the Soviets to pressure the Yugoslavs
              into ideological conformity have been encouraged, in part, by the Soviet belief that
              Yugoslavia has become relatively isolated in relations with the United States.
              Nevertheless, a visit is now unlikely this year in the absence of a renewed high-level
              U.S. initiative.</p>

              of about $100 million per year, consisting mainly of wheat. As yet, no inter-agency
              consideration has been given to this proposal. The prospect now for a multi-year
              agreement of this kind for Yugoslavia is not very good. Consideration of this request

                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit to Moscow, began to manifest itself soon
              thereafter. A secret letter was dispatched from the Soviet Communist Party to the
              satellites and some West European parties warning them against Yugoslav influence
              tending to splinter the Soviet orbit and “proletarian international solidarity.” In
              September 1956 <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> flew to Yugoslavia to
              visit <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, with the apparent intention of
              securing his acquiescence in the continuation of Soviet control in the satellites.

              and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to Yalta, but were only a

              <item>The outcome of the Polish crisis and the Hungarian revolt seems to have
                convinced the Soviet Union that “national Communism” was fraught with danger for
                their control of Eastern Europe. Soviet and Soviet-inspired polemics against the
                Yugoslavs have sought to prove the <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                regime’s ideological weaknesses and anti-Leninist tendencies. The Yugoslavs,
                however, have tended to enunciate theories which, if adopted, would seriously weaken
                the cohesion of the Communist world. The most complete formulation of this
                ideological line can be found in <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName>’s
                speech of December 7, 1956 which maintains that communism, in Yugoslavia as
                elsewhere, cannot have a future unless it proves itself able to better the lot of
                its people, and to avoid becoming a harsh bureaucratic apparatus distant from the
                people.</item>

              <item>It is too early to estimate the meaning of this development from the point of
                view of U.S. policy. The new estrangement between Moscow and Yugoslavia must mean,
                for the present, that Yugoslav influence in Eastern Europe, with the exception of
                Poland, is now at a low ebb. But, in the long run, the ability of the Yugoslavs to
                criticize Soviet-style Communism where it is vulnerable, in its own terminology,
                remains a divisive and demoralizing factor. As such, it may have continued effects
                on the ability of the Soviet Union to maintain stable control over the largely
                disaffected population of the nations in the Soviet orbit in Eastern Europe.</item>

            <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Trade With the Sino-Soviet Bloc.</hi> Yugoslav trade with the
              Sino-Soviet bloc expanded somewhat during the period under review. It represented 22
              per cent of total Yugoslav trade during 1956. Exports amounted to $74 million, while
              imports totalled $105 million. The excess of imports was financed primarily by
              drawings of more than $26 million on Soviet and satellite credits and loans during
              this same period. Exports to the bloc were comprised mainly of meats, fruits, tobacco,
              chemicals, lead, hemp, and wool. Imports were mainly cotton, petroleum, coal, iron and
              steel, some machinery and paper. During recent weeks difficulties encountered both in
              concluding trade agreements with the USSR and Eastern Germany and in obtaining Soviet
              agreement on the utilization of various promised credits, indicate a reversal of the

                <p>State Department communiqué gives grounds on which decision carry out previously
                  approved military deliveries to Yugoslavia is based. Approval includes
                  interpretation of state of relations between Yugoslavia and third countries. No
                  doubt that Yugoslav Government will examine this question from standpoint
                  political interests and practical needs of Yugoslavia. Question is raised whether
                  aid can be made dependent on appraisal Yugoslav relations with third countries. Is

              is, that no real reason for suspension ever existed.<note n="3" xml:id="d303fn3">See

              and “consistency” Yugoslav foreign policy which, they argue “does not vacillate as do
              policies toward Yugoslavia of great powers.”</p>
            <p>After this face-saving declaration of “independence,” Yugoslavs undoubtedly will

            <p>1598. Paris for West and CINCEUR. Department pass Defense. In conversation last night
              with Under Secretary of Foreign Office, Ivekovic, latter informed Embassy officer and
                <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">General Waters</persName> that Yugoslav authorities
              intended within short time open in Belgrade conversations with us on political as well
              as military level concerning US military assistance to Yugoslavia. Ivekovic expressed
              his government’s displeasure over the Department’s communiqué on resumption of
              military assistance,<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">See <ref target="#d302fn2">footnote
                  2, Document 302</ref>.</note> in complaining that Yugo authorities had not been
              consulted either in Belgrade or Washington. He questioned whether communiqué of this
              nature was necessary “for the Senate” and opined that it “would have been much wiser
              simply to have quietly resumed deliveries.” When it was pointed out that communiqué
              had been prepared by those who wished to help Yugoslavia he shrugged his shoulders in
              doubt.</p>
            <p>Turning to aid itself Ivekovic said that judging by communiqué tempo of deliveries of
              “small amount” involved was “not interesting” to Yugoslavia especially if deliveries
              were paced over one or two years; the manner in which announcement was made was
              “humiliating.” He explained that Yugoslavia did not like being given from time to time
              certificate of good conduct when everyone knew that his country was and would remain
              independent. He pointed out especially that treatment of this kind “hurt Yugoslav
              relations with Soviet satellites like Poland and that it did not encourage the
              satellites to turn to US for aid.”</p>
            <p>Yugoslav attitude no doubt reflects strong desire to receive more specific
              information on rate of military deliveries. <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">General
                Waters</persName> is under pressure from Yugoslav military to provide soon as
              possible plan for forthcoming deliveries. So far <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss>
              and Embassy have avoided giving any specific information on timing of deliveries in

              given informing us what information we can give Yugoslav Government re schedule of
              deliveries so that we can respond at least partially to questions being submitted.
                <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">General Waters</persName> and I believe effort should
              be made to give such information as we possibly can to enable Yugoslav Government to
              plan orderly receipt <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0805"/>and handling of
              forthcoming shipments. <persName corresp="#p_WGJK1">General Waters</persName>

              probable developments in these respects.</p>
            <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>The Yugoslav Communist dictatorship remains strong and apparently cohesive.
                Although there are chronic economic difficulties, widespread anti-Communist
                sentiments among the populace, and antagonistic attitudes among various nationality
                groups, these do not now pose a threat to political stability. The regime has
                successfully resisted Soviet pressures and maintained Yugoslavia’s independence on
                the international scene. A serious challenge to its control is improbable unless
                party unity should break down, and this development appears unlikely except possibly
                in the event of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s death. (Paras. 7,
                9–10, 32, 34–37)</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>We believe that Yugoslavia will continue to maintain its independent foreign
                policy, avoiding alignment in the East-West struggle. While continuing to criticize
                the inflexible attitudes which it perceives in the two blocs, Yugoslavia will
                nevertheless continue to recognize the bargaining power it gains from the struggle
                and would view with anxiety any drastic changes in the power balance. (Para.
                44)</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Barring the improbable event of substantial new Soviet concessions to Yugoslav
                views on national independence, the Yugoslavs are unlikely for some time to develop
                relations with the USSR as <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0806"/>close as those
                prevailing in the 1955–56 period. However, they will continue to moderate public
                expression of differences and will seek opportunities to expand economic and
                political contacts with the Sino-Soviet Bloc, hoping to exercise some influence
                toward the emergence of national Communist regimes. (Paras. 46–47)</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>In the face of Moscow’s campaign to impose ideological orthodoxy on the
                Satellites, the Yugoslavs are giving particular attention to their relations with
                Poland and Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will
                continue to cultivate these and any other Bloc states that demonstrate some ability
                to determine policy without complete Soviet dictation. He will also seek to
                establish special relations with the neutralist powers and with a wide variety of
                Socialist parties and organizations in the interest of his personal prestige and in
                an effort to make Yugoslavia a leader of political forces uncommitted to either
                Bloc. (Paras. 30, 50, 53)</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>Yugoslavia’s continuing need for outside economic aid and political support will
                make friendly relations with the West, and particularly the US, an important
                concern, though cooperation with the Western powers in the military sphere will
                remain limited. Present levels of US aid enable the Yugoslavs to carry on
                development programs that they would be loath to abandon. Were US aid to be
                curtailed, the Yugoslavs would be receptive to greater assistance from Bloc sources,
                though not at the price of surrendering their independent position. (Paras.
                54–56)</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>There is no figure of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s stature to
                replace him, and a crisis in party leadership could arise after his death,
                particularly if this coincided with an international crisis or major internal
                difficulties. However, we believe it likely that there will be a relatively peaceful
                emergence of a national Communist successor regime which will continue the policy of
                nonalignment rather than risk a renewal of domination by the Soviet Union. (Paras.
                37–43)</item>

                receptive to Yugoslav ideas and this was reflected by reference in communiqué to
                “peaceful and progressive forces of whole world and unity of international workers
                movement”. This in Yugoslavia’s view comprised all socialist parties and in no sense

              <item>Somewhat to my surprise <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Prica</persName> while
                admitting <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> had been influential in
                gaining support for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> during Moscow
                crisis tended to deprecate his importance and remarked his power may have been
                overestimated in some quarters. When I asked what he meant, Acting Foreign Secretary
                advanced explanation along following lines. In Yugoslav view, situation in USSR went
                far beyond explanation in terms of personalities. Soviet Union was in state of
                ferment flowing both from de-Stalinization and pressure from below for reforms. No
                one could be sure today how far de-Stalinization had gone or what final outcome
                would be but fall of such figures as <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                and Kaganovich was measure of depth of ferment in USSR. Yugoslav Government had
                impression this ferment was so widespread and internal pressures so great that
                Soviet leaders could not stop developments, which he would describe as “positive”,
                even if they wished. Evidence of this could be found in the “confusion and
                uncertainty” in satellite leadership which was particularly noticeable in Albania
                and Bulgaria. In Rumania Yugoslavs discerned some signs of improvement and
                willingness to recognize necessity for change. Although he would not specify how
                liberalization of Soviet policies toward satellites would be manifested, his
                expectation was that developments would occur perhaps sooner than was anticipated in
                West. He would not go so far as to say that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                  >Khrushchev</persName>’s policy was entirely correct in Yugoslav Government
                opinion but he was moving in right direction and justification was slowly emerging
                for Yugoslav tenacity in sticking to principles of Belgrade Declaration.</item>

            <p>The Secretary then spoke in substance as follows:</p>
            <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0810"/>
            <p>We have been very admiring of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName>’s
              courage in establishing the independence of his country. In the past, the United
              States has made large contributions, in both military and economic spheres, to assist
              the Yugoslav Government in maintaining its independence, despite the fact that we do
              not entirely agree with the type of governmental system in Yugoslavia. It is not,
              however, our official responsibility to interfere in internal matters as long as any
              given country maintains its independence and conducts itself internationally in an
              acceptable manner. In view of the rapidity with which news is now spread throughout
              the world, the public in every nation has become increasingly interested in domestic
              developments in other countries. These domestic matters have thus become news and are
              read with interest by the American people. Their reactions are duly reflected in our
              Congress.</p>
            <p>This development is relevant to the economic talks on which we are about to embark.
              There is growing concern in responsible quarters here and abroad as to whether
              Yugoslavia’s independence is being maintained to the same degree as heretofore. As
              Stalin himself once said, in a one-party state the party and the government are
              separate entities but the government can take no action without party consent. It
              seems that a greater degree of unity—perhaps subservience on Yugoslavia’s part—between
              the Yugoslav and Soviet Communist Parties, is taking place which seems to impair the
              independence of the Yugoslav Government. We have no means of knowing the precise
              relationship between the two parties, but we have to draw the necessary inferences
              from certain facts, and the degree to which the Yugoslav Government is consolidating
              its policies with those of the USSR gives concern with respect to the former’s
              independence. The most disturbing event is that the only countries to vote against the
              most recent UN resolution on Hungary comprised the Soviet bloc plus Yugoslavia. This
              is the first time that Yugoslavia has voted with the Soviet bloc when no other
              independent country was voting that way. The only Yugoslav departure from the Soviet
              line is the withholding of recognition from East Germany and there are indications
              that recognition is now being contemplated by the Yugoslav Government. Such a
              development would obliterate the last difference between the Yugoslav and Soviet
              foreign policy lines. It would seem that were Yugoslavia really independent there
              would be at least one time just under the laws of chance when the Yugoslavs would find
              the West right and the Soviets wrong.</p>
            <p>The Secretary would say that he personally still holds the view that Yugoslavia is
              maintaining its independence and that the US is justified in attempting to nurture and
              support this independence. But, he would have to say that he is becoming increasingly
              isolated in this view not only as far as the executive branch and the Congress <pb
                n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0811"/>of the United States are concerned but also
              with respect to our allies in their attempts to evaluate the current situation as
              regards Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the question of economic assistance, we are facing a year when our
              resources are limited and when we failed by considerable majority to obtain the
              authority in the economic field which we sought. Hence, our available resources must
              be rationed between many deserving claimants. He ought frankly to say that in order to
              carry along our present policies we are going to need more cooperation than we have
              been getting from the Yugoslavs to validate our position before Congress and the
              American public and to explain to other countries why they are being cut down in the
              matter of economic aid. As far as the next year is concerned, we have already been put
              on notice by powerful figures in the Congress that there will be greater effort than
              ever before to eliminate aid to Yugoslavia, if things continue as they are going
              now.</p>
            <p>The Secretary wished to make it perfectly clear that nothing he was saying should be
              interpreted as an effort to coerce Yugoslavia in the formulation of its policies. We
              want Yugoslavia to be absolutely independent, not only of the USSR but of the US and
              any other country. But, no other independent state in the world, including the various
              neutral states, has so completely aligned itself with USSR in the international field
              as has Yugoslavia. This cannot help but raise doubts in the minds of American people
              and its representatives in the Congress. This is the problem we face. It is proper to
              state it frankly at the beginning of these economic talks. We would welcome anything
              which can be said to reassure us and to enable us to reassure others. We are pretty
              much lacking evidence to refute those saying that because of closer relations between
              the Yugoslav and the Soviet Communist parties, which control the governments in both
              countries, Yugoslav independence is being compromised.</p>
            <p>The Secretary indicated that he was addressing his remarks both to the Ambassador and
              to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName> since perhaps the latter, as
              Minister of Finance, was not primarily concerned with essentially political
              matters.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName> responded to the Secretary’s statement
              along the following lines:</p>
            <p>He thanked the Secretary for his exposition of US views and for his statement of the
              problem as seen here. He was indeed happy to hear of the Secretary’s belief in
              Yugoslavia’s independence. He wished to reaffirm categorically Yugoslavia’s
              determination to maintain its independence and to state that this determination will
              remain unshaken in future.</p>
            <p>No one has better insight into the developments in the USSR than the Yugoslavs. They
              fully realized the evils of the Stalinist <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0812"
              />system with its emphasis externally on preparation for war and internally on the
              ruthless repudiation of all freedoms. Hence, it is the Yugoslav belief that everything
              possible should be done to assist in the evolution now in progress away from this
              system in the USSR. The Yugoslav Government is convinced that even the modest advances
              toward the defeat of Stalinism must be fostered since its elimination will influence
              Soviet foreign and domestic policies and will have favorable repercussions on the
              international scene. Soviet society is still fraught with contradictions. There are
              still grave internal difficulties being encountered in achieving stabilization in the
              sense of evolution away from the bad conditions which used to prevail in the USSR. Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName> trusted that recent developments have
              justified the Yugoslav view, repeatedly expressed in the last several years, of this
              evolutionary trend in the Soviet Union. The ouster of <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                >Molotov</persName> and other Stalinist leaders was an important turning of this
              page in Soviet history but its impact cannot yet be fully felt. Some time must elapse
              before its full importance can become manifest.</p>
            <p>Considered in the foregoing light, the crux of the matter insofar as the improvement
              of relations between Yugoslavia and the USSR is concerned is, in Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName>’s view, not that Yugoslavia has shifted its
              position but that the USSR has changed. It cannot be said that the Yugoslav Government
              or party has become subservient to the Soviets. On the contrary, the Yugoslavs have
              exerted an important influence toward change in the USSR. Without going into details
              about the question of the Yugoslav position regarding various international issues,
              the closer coincidence of Yugoslav-Soviet positions should be examined from the point
              of view of determining whether this was the result of a change in Yugoslav or Soviet
              attitudes. Yugoslavia did not change its position on Hungary. Its vote in the United
              Nations was not on the substance of the resolution but was determined “in the context
              of contemporary international relations”.</p>
            <p>With respect to the Communist Party in Yugoslavia, there can be no foreign influence
              permitted in the sense of subservience in the development of its actions and policies.
              This same principle applies to Yugoslav party relations with the parties in the other
              countries of Eastern Europe, and Yugoslav influence in this respect is helpful to the
              Communist parties in those countries.</p>
            <p>Two episodes demonstrate Yugoslavia’s equanimity in international affairs and the
              purposeful course which it is pursuing. When <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> was in Prague he declared that Yugoslavia was a satellite of
              the United States. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName> was in Moscow
              last year he was asked how many US military bases there were in Yugoslavia. These two
              incidents demonstrate the continued existence of grave internal conflicts in the USSR
              and show that Yugoslavia is fully aware of these difficulties in the USSR. But the
              Yugoslav Government believes <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0813"/>that the trend
              in the USSR cannot be turned back to the ugly past and that the future being shaped
              there will benefit the whole world. The Yugoslav Government has this in mind in
              building its relations with the USSR.</p>
            <p>Regarding US assistance for Yugoslavia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                >Humo</persName> wished to stress its value and importance in Yugoslavia’s
              development and recovery and his Government’s recognition of this fact. He understands
              that it is in US interests to see Yugoslavia economically strong and independent. As
              has several times been stated, the Yugoslav Government does not intend to alter its
              friendly relations with the US and the West because of the friendly relations which it
              maintains with the USSR.</p>
            <p>In responding to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName>, the Secretary said
              that although it was clearly impossible to settle in this talk all matters alluded to
              thus far, he would comment on one or two of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                >Humo</persName>’s remarks. The United States shares the Minister’s opinion that
              there are evolutionary signs in the USSR which may indicate that some of the worst
              features of what is called Stalinism are being removed. He took note of Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName>’s statement that while there have been important
              changes in the Soviet leadership there may be some time before their full import
              becomes clear. He hoped that there would be a change for the better, but this has yet
              to be seen as far as Soviet international policies are concerned. Not since 1950, when
              Soviet aggressive attitudes reached their high point in Korea, has there been as
              aggressive a Soviet foreign policy as now seems to be the case today. <persName
                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s press conference before leaving for the UN
              was one of the most vicious statements ever made by any Soviet Foreign Minister. The
              most recent Soviet Note on the Middle East was so rude in its expressions and false
              accusations that it is questionable whether it was a proper diplomatic note between
              countries at least at peace with each other. The designs of the Soviet Union in the
              Middle East were displayed in the massive shipments of armaments in amounts quite
              beyond the capability for use of the countries in the Middle East for which ostensibly
              they were destined.</p>
            <p>In the case of Germany, the Secretary observed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> agreed at
              the Summit Conference to free elections. Yet the Soviet Government has made no
              pretense to uphold this commitment and frankly says that no reunification of Germany
              can take place except under a system enabling the extension of Soviet control to all
              Germany. The Secretary doubted whether Stalin would have been as brutal in his
              repression of the heroic Hungarian uprising as his successors were. So, while we do
              not lament the departure of some of the old Stalinist leaders, we have difficulty in
              taking hope from the behaviour of those replacing them. We can understand the
              satisfaction of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Marshal Tito</persName> and his
              Government over the denunciation <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0814"/>within the
              Soviet Union of Stalinism which <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> himself
              had so vehemently denounced in the past. But, the Secretary suggested that the
              disappearance of one hated and distrusted symbol does not automatically mean
              satisfaction with its replacement.</p>
            <p>The Secretary said that perhaps he had gone beyond the intended scope of this
              conversation in which he desired merely to explain the genuine difficulties
              confronting us. He regretted that the Yugoslav Government had thus far been unable to
              do a little more to facilitate our task when we want to help Yugoslavia. Nevertheless,
              we hope that we shall be able to do something helpful for Yugoslavia and that
              Yugoslavia can do something to help us to help Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>Speaking for himself and for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName>, the
              Yugoslav Ambassador declared that we are now living through a hazy and fluid period in
              international affairs, in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Consequently he was confident
              that mutual relations between the US and Yugoslavia could not properly be considered
              on the basis of a short period of time and trusted that future developments will show
              the genuineness of Yugoslav independence and Yugoslavia’s desire for peace. Since the
              US also cherishes these principles, the natural development of US-Yugoslav relations
              must be mutually beneficial.</p>

            <p>At the Secretary’s Staff Meeting on October 7, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                >Dillon</persName> reported that the Central Intelligence Agency had information
              indicating that Yugoslavia planned to establish diplomatic relations with East
              Germany, but was delaying because of the possible effect on the current Yugoslav-U.S.
              aid negotiations. According to the minutes of the meeting, Secretary <persName

                >Tito</persName> had told him as much at their meeting in November 1955. The
              Secretary directed that the reaction of the West German Government be ascertained
              before the matter was discussed with the Yugoslav Government. (Department of State,

              problem. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> replied that Yugoslavia’s
              action would be seen as an abandonment of its policy of non-alignment, and as a <pb

            </list>
            <p>The Secretary stated that we have been told by the German Embassy here that, subject
              to US, UK and French views, the German Government has decided to terminate relations
              with Yugoslavia in retaliation for Yugoslavia’s recognition of the East German regime.
              The Secretary said that we are not disposed to dissuade the Germans since, in our
              opinion, the Yugoslavs have already proceeded too far into the danger zone in their
              relations with the USSR. He stated that by siding with the Soviets in the UN vote on
              the Hungarian Resolution, the Yugoslavs have eliminated the last point of difference
              between themselves and the Russians in the foreign policy field. The Secretary added
              that our intelligence sources have reported that the Soviet slogans designed for
              consumption in Yugoslavia are now identical with those used for the Eastern European
              satellites.</p>
            <p>The Secretary also stated that our feelings about the Yugoslav action in recognizing
              the East German regime will be reflected in the attitude we take in our current
              economic negotiations with the Yugoslavs. While we are not disposed, he said, to cast
              the Yugoslavs into “outer darkness” we would expect to curtail the military, economic
              and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 aid which they have been receiving.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> expressed agreement with this policy
              and pointed out that during his September visit to Belgrade<note n="2"
                xml:id="d309fn2"><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> visited Belgrade
                September 4–8 for talks with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and other
                Yugoslav leaders.</note> he had warned the <pb n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0816"
              />Yugoslavs that they are becoming too involved with the Russians. He said that they
              had replied that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is very different
              from Stalin and that their eyes are wide open in their dealings with the USSR. [<hi

            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that the Yugoslavs do
              not realize yet that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is more
              versatile and actually more dangerous than Stalin. He said the Yugoslavs consider that
              with Stalin’s death and <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s demotion they
              have won a great victory and are now safe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> repeated his agreement with the
              proposed German action in breaking relations stating that it would be a real slap in
              the face to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said that the Germans were quite prepared to
              make their own decision to break relations but would like to know in advance that they
              would have our support.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he believed that we were all agreed in this
              matter.</p>

              <item>US Policy toward Yugoslavia</item>
            </list>
            <p>In view of the Yugoslav recognition of East Germany and the break in diplomatic
              relations with the Federal Republic which is expected momentarily, we have considered
              what new courses of action might appropriately be adopted with respect to
              Yugoslavia.</p>
            <p>We believe some adjustment in our assistance programs is desirable but the manner in
              which this would be done is of the utmost importance. Abrupt cessation of all aid,
              especially if accompanied by wide publicity, might well drive Yugoslavia almost
              irretrievably into the Soviet bloc. It could also be misinterpreted as an acceptance
              of the failure of our policies, and might thus serve to undermine the basis for the US
              program in Poland and ultimately perhaps in other countries of Eastern Europe. On the
              other hand, we realize that through recognition of East Germany the Yugoslavs, by
              alteration of their own policy, have virtually completed the total alignment of their
              foreign policies with those of the Soviet Union. As we have made clear to them on
              several occasions in recent weeks, this alignment <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789"
                facs="0817"/>makes it difficult to justify continuing our aid programs unchanged.
              Some curtailment of these programs would therefore appear to be desirable in order to
              underline the concern with which we regard this positive move on the part of the
              Yugoslavs in the abandonment of an independent, non-alignment policy. Moreover, this
              action by the Yugoslavs particularly concerns the US as one of the Four Powers with
              special responsibilities in Germany.</p>
            <p>The continuing although modest flow of spare parts and supplies which now constitutes
              the major part of our military assistance program in Yugoslavia serves the useful
              purpose of maintaining the equipment already furnished and thus reduces the
              effectiveness of Soviet pressures to replace us as suppliers. Jet aircraft, however,
              now being furnished at a rate of only 10 a month with over 300 yet to be delivered,
              have long been a target for critics of our policy, while the rate of delivery and the
              increasing obsolescence of the types being provided has reduced their effectiveness as
              a deterrent to Yugoslav interest in finding other suppliers. On balance, therefore, we
              believe it would be desirable to suspend<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2"><persName
                  corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> crossed out the word “terminate” and wrote
                “suspend” above it.</note> the jet aircraft program, while continuing, however, to
              supply all other military items as programmed. It might be noted that the Department
              of Defense has already requested guidance from us for purposes of logistics and
              planning on deliveries after November, in accordance with our understanding last May
              that the aircraft program would be previewed at this time.</p>
            <p>As for economic assistance, we believe we should suspend negotiations on the <gloss
                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 programs and on <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
              Special Economic Assistance as inopportune in the recent circumstances. We would
              indicate that while negotiations may be undertaken later there can be no assurance
              that the outcome will be that envisaged during the recent talks with Finance Minister
                <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName>. With respect to the Majdanpek copper
              project, on which we promised an early reply during the talks, we should inform the
              Yugoslavs that US participation in this project is not feasible at this time.</p>
            <p>With respect to the important question of timing, we believe no action should be
              taken until the break in diplomatic relations has been announced by the Federal
              Republic and until public opinion on the matter has had an opportunity to manifest
              itself. Moreover, when we inform the Yugoslavs of our actions, we should make it clear
              that we have not interpreted their recent actions as a relinquishment of their
              independence and that we fully respect their right, as a sovereign state, to pursue
              the course of action they deem to be in their own best interest. The US desires to
              maintain good relations with Yugoslavia, and believes that a basis for mutual
              cooperation and understanding exists. As we have pointed out on three occasions <pb
                n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0818"/>recently, however, the choice they appear to
              have made in aligning their policies with the USSR renders it difficult for us to
              continue to support an aid program for Yugoslavia before the US Congress and tends to
              undermine the basis on which such a program can be justified.</p>

            <p>In carrying out the courses of action approved by the Secretary with respect to
              Yugoslavia we believe it is important, particularly in view of Ambassador <persName

                >Not further identified.</note> that we avoid giving <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791"
                facs="0819"/>the impression we are motivated primarily by a desire to support the
              Federal Republic in its present stand. The Germans themselves have not asked for any
              gesture of support, and do not apparently expect one at this juncture. The Yugoslavs,
              on the other hand, may well be prepared, in their present mood, to interpret any
              untoward action on our part as confirmation of their suspicion that we “pressured”
              Germany into breaking relations. We therefore believe the present situation calls for
              careful and deliberate action on our part in order to impress upon the Yugoslavs that
              it is the almost complete alignment of their policies with those of the USSR that has
              obliged us to change our programs, and not merely their attitude on any issue. This
              is, of course, consistent with the position taken in our various contacts with the
              Yugoslavs in recent weeks; you will recall that it was also discussed briefly in the
              paragraph on timing and presentation in our memorandum to the Secretary of October

              exists. However, as we have pointed out on three recent occasions, choice they appear
              to have made in aligning their policies with USSR makes it difficult for us to

              This action will lend credence to Soviet propaganda that US was responsible for German
              action in breaking relations, that our aid program is based on political conditions,
              and that we are unwilling to allow Yugoslavia to follow an independent policy but are
              forcing them to join one camp or the other. In view of our action will be extremely
              difficult for Yugoslavs to make any pro-Western moves since these would be considered
              as a result of our economic pressure. Since Yugoslavia unlikely at any time break
              relations with East Germany would appear difficult for us in the future to renew aid,
              should this become desirable, if we go as far at this time as is indicated in

              Yugoslavs as proposed last sentence reference telegram. Could we not merely tell them
              that embarking on any new aid programs at this time likely provoke congressional

            <p>5. In reply to the Secretary’s question Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                >Dillon</persName> said he plans to see the Yugoslav Ambassador later in the day to
              discuss the question of economic aid. He understood that Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> plans to confer with <persName corresp="#p_ML1"
                >Mates</persName> in a few weeks regarding military aid aspects. He said he plans to
              tell the Ambassador that, in view of the still closer alignment of Yugoslav policy
              with the USSR and the resulting adverse congressional and public opinion in this
              country, the time is not opportune to start <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480
              negotiations. He also intends to say that the prospects of finding funds for the
              Majdanpek copper project are not good at present and the Yugoslav Government may wish
              to seek financing elsewhere. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted
              that certain carryover <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 funds in the amount of
              $7.5 million are still available to Yugoslavia and that the US will continue to supply
              military spare parts for Yugoslav land forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> also said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"
                >Riddleberger</persName> has been instructed to return to post immediately.</p>
            <p>The Secretary stressed the need for a complete and thorough examination of US policy
              toward Yugoslavia, commenting that we should not take impulsive actions on this
              subject. He cited the large investment we have in the policy that <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, because of his personal ambition and personal
              influence within the Soviet Bloc, could be the one to lead the satellite states to a
              greater degree of independence. He said that although the US should clearly indicate
              its displeasure at the Yugoslav recognition of the East German regime, we should also
              be careful not to push <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> into the arms of
              the USSR unless we are satisfied that he has surrendered this personal ambition.</p>
            <p>In the light of the Secretary’s remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                >Dillon</persName> said he would inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1"
                >Mates</persName> that we find it necessary to restudy the timing of the proposed
              economic negotiations with Yugoslavia in view of the effect of the recent actions of
              that government on public and congressional opinion in the US; and, therefore, it will
              be impossible for economic aid negotiations to commence next week as had been planned
              because the study is taking longer than had been anticipated. The Secretary authorized
              Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to make remarks in this vein.</p>

              <item>Call of the Yugoslav Ambassador</item>
            </list>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that he had asked the
              Ambassador to call in order to clarify certain unfortunate newspaper accounts
              appearing in the last day or so which indicated that a decision had been reached to
              suspend US aid programs to Yugoslavia. These stories, he said, were not entirely
              accurate. As is often the case, newspapermen obtain a kernel of fact upon which they
              build, producing an exaggeration of the true situation.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> recalled, however, the conversation
              between the Secretary of State and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Humo</persName> in
              which the Secretary pointed out that Yugoslavia’s closer, if not total, alignment with
              Soviet positions on major international issues created a very difficult problem for us
              in providing aid to Yugoslavia.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">See <ref target="#d307"
                  >Document 307</ref>.</note> As a result of what has happened since this
              conversation took place, it has become necessary for us to reexamine the situation,
              particularly as regards timing. It will be necessary for us to study the effects of
              the present situation on attitudes in Congress, bearing in mind our need to go before
              the Congress again for next year’s program. Therefore, while no decision has been
              taken on the aid program for Yugoslavia, one result of this present situation is we
              cannot now proceed with negotiation of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
              program for this year as early as was indicated during the <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                >Humo</persName> talks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> made it
              clear that the present problem would not <pb n="796" xml:id="pg_796" facs="0824"
              />affect the smaller <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program on which
              negotiations had begun in Belgrade.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> expressed appreciation for
              this clarification, saying that he would, of course, communicate it to his Government
              immediately. He felt obliged to state, however, that reexamination by the US of its
              Yugoslav policy was not an unfamiliar occurrence, having happened on a number of
              occasions in the past and even several times in one year. He found it regrettable that
              situations continually arise requiring study and reappraisal by the US of subjects on
              which the Yugoslav Government has frequently made itself clear. The Ambassador
              maintained that he didn’t object to an examination of the Yugoslav foreign policy
              which considered this policy as a whole. He did object, however, to concentration on
              specific acts. Foreign policy, he believed, is a matter of continuity and specific
              acts have to be examined in the light of the more general policy over a period of
              time.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador believed also that friendly relations between countries could not
              imply agreement on all questions. The important thing, however, was the way positions
              were taken. He pointed out here that in those cases where Yugoslavia has differed with
              the US, the Yugoslav position has been expressed in line with its general foreign
              policy. Yugoslavia, he emphasized, has made no hostile statements or engaged in
              hostile acts.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> then launched into a defense
              of Yugoslavia’s foreign policies, covering familiar ground with respect to Syria,
              Germany, and Hungary. He maintained throughout that Yugoslavia has not joined in any
              hostile alignment against the US and, in this connection, alluded to the fact that
              Yugoslavia had not echoed the recent Soviet charges concerning threats to the peace in
              the Middle East.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador emphasized that Yugoslavia’s positions on international issues have
              been consistent with its policy of non-alignment. Despite this, Yugoslavia, he stated,
              was subjected to the most hostile propaganda in the US, directed at its internal
              system and foreign policy, especially by the Congress and the Press. It was not enough
              that the Secretary of State and the Department of State understood Yugoslavia’s
              policies. Relations between two countries must be looked at as a whole. This basic
              hostility, he insisted, was responsible for the constant reexamination of policy. If
              there was something wrong with our relations it was not the fault of Yugoslavia, but
              the hostile attitude in the US, which has been offset only in part by the Secretary of
              State.</p>
            <p>Again arguing that Yugoslavia was not aligned with the East, the Ambassador cited as
              evidence the efforts made by Yugoslavia to develop its economic relations with the
              West and create permanent ties. <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0825"/>If a country
              wished to align itself with a bloc it would do so on such a basic matter as economic
              relations. Yugoslavia, he maintained, has been rebuffed by the West on a number of
              proposals which would have the effect of tying it to the West. Yugoslavia is thus
              being driven to the East. Notwithstanding these rebuffs, however, Yugoslavia has
              refused offers from the East to develop basic areas of its economy such as minerals
              and power. Another example cited by the Ambassador was the rejection of Soviet offers
              to establish television in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia did not wish to tie itself in with
              the television standards of the East and was therefore paying hard cash to buy
              transmitters and other equipment in the US and Western Europe. The Ambassador hoped
              that these facts would be given due consideration in our reexaminations.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that, of course, these matters
              are [being] given consideration. He explained that in a democracy there is a lot of
              discussion with many points of view expressed, and from these a balance is reached.
              The conclusions reached in past years have certainly not been unfavorable to the
              Yugoslav Government. Yugoslavia’s recent actions, however, have upset the balance of
              forces. The Department has to try to maintain the balance of forces in the way we
              think best. We think we understand the general outline of Yugoslavia’s policy, but the
              events of recent weeks have, as the Secretary has said, made the situation much more
              difficult. The Department will, of course, examine the matter calmly, looking at the
              whole problem, and not just a few issues. While we cannot predict the outcome, Mr.
                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said, we hoped for the best.</p>
            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> commented that after five
              years in the US, he was not inclined to be so optimistic. Regardless of what
              Yugoslavia does, he said, short of alignment with the West or abandonment of
              socialism, both of which are clearly impossible, it could not stop the hostile
              propaganda against it. This basic hostility in the US, which actually represents
              efforts to subvert Yugoslavia, come to the fore from time to time, forcing the State
              Department constantly to review its policy. The prime example of this hostility, the
              Ambassador said, was the treatment of the proposed visit by <persName
                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> to this country.<note n="2" target="d315fn2"
                >Regarding <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s visit to the United
                States, which was cancelled, see <ref target="#d295">Documents 295</ref>–<ref
                  target="#d298">298</ref>.</note></p>
            <p>Another example of hostility mentioned by the Ambassador was our visa policy as
              applied to Yugoslav newspapermen and students. He stated that although no obstacles
              were put in the way of American newspapermen going to Yugoslavia, Yugoslav journalists
              could come to the US only under false pretenses, i.e., as Yugoslav government
              officials. He also cited the example of six scholarships having <pb n="798"
                xml:id="pg_798" facs="0826"/>been set aside for Yugoslav students, the students
              being selected by the American Embassy in Belgrade, and then visas could not be
              obtained. The scholarships subsequently lapsed.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador concluded, saying that our relations were a patchwork, which has held
              together for some time and may hold together for some time in the future. He felt much
              less optimistic now, however, than when he first came to this country.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that he did not share the
              Ambassador’s pessimism. The majority of Americans believe that each country is
              entitled to adopt any system of government it wished so long as it didn’t try to force
              that system on other countries. He thought that there was considerable understanding
              of Yugoslavia’s position in the US, and therefore was optimistic as to the future
              course of our relations.</p>

                  <persName>Dulles</persName>’ memorandum of the conversation reads in part: “The
                President said that he had noticed reports in the papers that we were planning to
                cut off assistance to Yugoslavia. He suggested that we should go slow about this as
                we did not want to force the Yugoslavs against their will into a greater dependence
                upon the Soviet Union. I said that at least some of the stories in the press seemed
                to have derived from Italian sources which were always hostile toward Yugoslavia. I
                said that while we felt that it was useful to give the Yugoslavs a sense of our
                dissatisfaction of their recognition of East Germany, we had not in fact decided to
                cut off aid, and this whole topic was under advisement.” {<hi rend="italic"

              our Embassies concerned that no decisions have yet been taken with respect to ultimate

              programmed. Aircraft scheduled for November delivery will also go forward; a formal

              as a result of recent developments, we needed to review the Yugoslav aid situation,
              particularly as to timing, and noted that while no decision had been reached, the

                >Dillon</persName> did not give notification of the aircraft suspension, as you will
              recall we planned to delay this until we had an opportunity to observe Yugoslav
              reaction to the break in diplomatic relations announced by the Federal Republic on
              October 19.</p>
            <p>Our recommendation for modification of US aid programs had been prompted by
              Yugoslavia’s persistence in aligning itself with the USSR on virtually all important
              international issues despite clear warnings from us of the consequences of such a
              course. The Yugoslavs maintained, on the other hand, however, that they had not
              abandoned their policy of non-alignment, while on the other they claimed that where
              their positions did coincide with those of the USSR, this was desirable in order to
              support <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who was regarded by the
              Yugoslavs as the Soviet leader most responsive to liberating forces and hence most
              deserving of support. On <hi rend="italic">Hungary,</hi> for example, they pointed out
              that Yugoslavia’s condemnation of the <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0828"/>first
              Soviet intervention still stands and that Yugoslavia’s recent vote in the UN does not
              indicate any change in their appreciation of the Hungarian situation. On <hi
                rend="italic">disarmament,</hi> they proposed a resolution in the UN which
              incorporates a number of provisions at variance with the current Soviet position,
              although it appears on balance still more favorable to the USSR than it is to the US.
              As for <hi rend="italic">Germany,</hi> there are numerous indications that Yugoslavia
              miscalculated the force of the West German reaction, and wishes now to avoid any
              further deterioration of relations with Bonn. For its part, the Federal Republic has
              now indicated that it intends 1) to maintain consular representation in Yugoslavia,
              and 2) to continue full economic relations, including implementation of the long-term
              “reparations” credit extended last year. <hi rend="italic"><persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s illness,</hi> announced yesterday, seems to
              indicate a reluctance on his part to project himself into the power struggle in
              Moscow, and may also reflect an awareness that he may have gone too far in his
              rapprochement with the USSR. Moreover, with respect to US <hi rend="italic">military
                aid,</hi> the Soviet power struggle may well have increased Yugoslavia’s
              appreciation of its value while US press speculation over possible cuts may increase
              their apprehension and cause them to move now with greater caution. In short, some of
              the major objectives of the modifications in US aid which we proposed may already have
              been at least partly realized.</p>

            <p rend="center">Summary and Conclusions</p>
            <list>
              <label>1.</label>
              <item>The Yugoslav leaders have appeared convinced that the USSR under <persName
                  corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is willing to live with Yugoslav
                independence and with gradually increasing autonomy among the Satellite regimes.
                They hope to insure the security of their country and the maintenance of their own
                regime and to increase their influence in the Communist world by supporting
                  <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and what they believe to be
                  <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s anti-Stalinist policies. As
                long as Belgrade assesses Soviet policies favorably, we believe that Yugoslavia will
                maintain its rapprochement with the USSR and may gradually move toward a somewhat
                closer alignment within limits which would safeguard its independence.</item>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>However, we see many possibilities of an interruption in the trend toward closer
                alignment. A Soviet reversion to tough Stalinist policies, such as undue pressure on
                Yugoslavia or a tough line in the European Satellites, or a variety of other
                possible developments could lead again to strained relations or even to another
                break. The <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> ouster, for example,
                apparently has already prompted Belgrade to take another look at its policy toward
                the USSR.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item>Moreover, we believe that there are distinct limits on how far <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> feels he can safely go toward Moscow. We
                believe that he will not be willing to make himself militarily or economically
                dependent on the USSR, or to join the Warsaw Pact or the Council of Economic Mutual
                Aid. Within the general trend of his policy, moreover, we think that <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will be alert to any Soviet attempts to assert
                control over him, and to any other Soviet actions or policies which appear dangerous
                to Yugoslav interests; if he feels that such developments <pb n="803"
                  xml:id="pg_803" facs="0831"/>are occurring he will almost certainly desire to turn
                away from a close Soviet alignment.</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>In any event, the Yugoslavs will probably remain sufficiently suspicious of
                Soviet intentions and concerned enough over possible reversals in Soviet policy to
                strive to keep a door open to the West. By themselves, Western policies regarding
                the Yugoslav-Soviet rapprochement probably could not decisively influence Yugoslav
                policies, but they could lead Belgrade to limit its pro-Moscow moves. For example,
                US aid, while probably not so vital as to cause <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> to alter his basic policy to ensure it, is probably sufficiently
                important to lead him to take some pains to retain it, at least in part. Hence: <list>
                  <label>a.</label>
                  <item>Postponement or the threat of further reductions in US aid might cause the
                    Yugoslav regime to make some political gestures favorable to the West, and to be
                    more cautious in its approach to the USSR.</item>
                  <label>b.</label>
                  <item>Complete withdrawal of US aid and moral support would not only weaken his
                    ability to maintain his independence but would also seriously reduce the US’s
                    leverage on <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s future moves.</item>
                  <label>c.</label>
                  <item>Continuation of substantial US aid, irrespective of <persName
                      corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s attitude toward Moscow, would probably
                    reinforce <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s confidence that the
                    West was committed to his support, and that he could maintain his independent
                    position even while he aligned some policies more closely with those of the
                    Soviet Union.</item>

              <item>In hour and half conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                in presence Foreign Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_VDJ1">Vilfan</persName> on
                Brioni this morning, I opened with President’s message of sympathy and wishes for

                sincere thanks to the President and his hope that he in turn is now fully recovered
                to health. I also gave <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> the President’s
                personal opinion that Yugoslav recognition of East Germany represented retrogressive
                step.</item>
              <pb n="804" xml:id="pg_804" facs="0832"/>
              <label>2.</label>
              <item>After having expressed our admiration for <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName>’s courage in establishing and maintaining Yugoslavia’s
                independence under most difficult circumstances and recalling extent to which we had
                given material support to this Yugoslav policy, I described reasons why US is now
                concerned that Yugoslav independence is not being maintained as heretofore. In this
                I followed closely Secretary’s remarks to <persName corresp="#p_HA1"
                  >Humo</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">See <ref target="#d307">Document
                    307</ref>.</note> (and therefore do not repeat argumentation here) adding that
                since that conversation Yugoslav Government had recognized East Germany, an action
                which we regretted. Recalling Secretary’s conversation with <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> on Brioni in November 1955<note n="4"
                  xml:id="d320fn4">See <ref target="#d263">Document 263</ref>.</note> when former
                had outlined agreement on Germany that heads of states had arrived at and how we
                hoped to proceed, I pointed out that Yugoslav recognition was in effect support for
                Soviet Government which had promptly violated its own commitment. This Yugoslav
                action together with others mentioned had so aligned Yugoslav policy with Soviet
                that it raised legitimate concern in American opinion respecting continuation of
                independent policy, particularly when relationship between <gloss target="#t_CPSU1"
                  >CPSU</gloss> and UCY was taken into account. In conclusion, I said that while US
                had no intention or desire to interfere in internal Yugoslav affairs, there was no
                sentiment in US for support of Yugoslav regime per se and that support we had been
                able to give found its justification in the independent line Yugoslavia had followed
                until recent months.</item>
              <label>3.</label>
              <item><persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said he would begin his reply by
                referring to letter he had sent <persName>Eisenhower</persName> several years
                  ago.<note n="5" xml:id="d320fn5">Apparently a reference to <persName
                    corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>’s letter of August 26, 1956; see <ref
                    target="#d284fn2">footnote 2, Document 284</ref>.</note> In that letter he had
                tried to explain how he looked at our relations and particularly aid questions.
                Yugoslavia, he was convinced, did have an independent policy but its application
                gave rise to so many difficulties in US and had led to such suspensions that they
                interfered with our good relations. He had expressed opinion in his letter to
                President that he would prefer to cease military aid entirely if it gave rise to
                such difficulties and today situation was worse than ever. As military aid seemed to
                cause such difficulties for us (to the extent of embittering our relations) and as
                it affected ability of Yugoslavia to carry out what it had judged to be truly
                independent policy, his government had now decided to propose discontinuance of
                military aid and suggested that our representatives convene to decide quietly how
                this could be best accomplished. He said this was considered decision of his
                government and he thought it was best way out. I replied that I would of course
                submit it promptly to Washington and that, speaking personally, <pb n="805"
                  xml:id="pg_805" facs="0833"/>it might provide solution. I remarked there would be
                number technical questions involved in closing up the program as it had continued
                over so long a period. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> agreed and
                Foreign Secretary remarked it should be kept absolutely secret until both
                governments had worked out procedures for discontinuance,</item>
              <label>4.</label>
              <item>Referring to the President’s remarks on recognition of East Germany, <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said he wished to clarify certain points. His
                action was not hasty or ill-considered and had been in the air for over a year. It
                would have been done sooner had it not been for Soviet attacks early in 1957 against
                Yugoslavia. It was not planned as move to make things more difficult for <persName
                  corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> nor, as had been suggested in Western press,
                result of deal between him and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. It
                represented logical continuation of independent foreign policy based upon principles
                long enunciated. Until recognition was accorded Yugoslavia could not have free hand
                in its relations with Eastern European states and its influence would diminish. He
                would ask us to realize that it was logical development given Yugoslavia’s middle
                position and should be accepted as based upon principle that way must be found to
                settle great issues between blocs. I inquired if these principles implied that
                Yugoslav recognition could therefore be expected of other divided countries such as
                Korea, China, and Indochina, if his principles implied acceptance of situations of
                fact followed by attempts to final solution. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> got out of that query, with some help from Foreign Secretary, by
                somewhat rambling reply to general effect recognition of East Germany was decided on
                its merits alone and represented “positive” step. Yugoslav decision was based on its
                own appraisal and recognition of other countries would have to be similarly decided
                as Yugoslavia did now want to “subordinate its foreign policy to bloc
                considerations” (whatever that may mean).</item>
              <label>5.</label>
              <item>In seeking further clarification of Yugoslav position vis-à-vis US and USSR,
                following emerged. When I commented upon increasingly hard line of Soviet policy
                  (<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> press conference, note on N.E. to
                US and declarations at launching of satellite), <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> said he is convinced present Soviet declarations do not represent
                long-term intentions. He said West should not react so sharply to Soviet
                declarations and remarked some of our Generals indulged in bellicose speeches as
                well. We should by now be accustomed to sharp speeches and not become too alarmed. I
                recalled that circumstances should not be overlooked when aggressive declarations
                were made, attended as they were by fall of <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1"
                  >Zhukov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> replied he was
                convinced <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s fall was not result of
                foreign policy considerations but was purely internal. I asked him how he
                interpreted removal of <persName corresp="#p_ZMGK1">Zhukov</persName> to which he
                replied it was internal matter and therefore he could not properly comment. He would
                say, however, that West should deal “with whole complex of Soviet policies” and not
                worry too much <pb n="806" xml:id="pg_806" facs="0834"/>about personalities. I said
                given type of government in USSR this was not so simple as our experience with
                violated agreements fully demonstrated. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                did not deny this but said he was still convinced process of liberation in Soviet
                Union will continue. Russian people expect and await such development and pressure
                for it will continue, It would be wrong to assume that Soviet foreign policy is
                purely matter of internal developments and personalities. It represents foreign
                policy of powerful Socialist country developed as result of many interests.</item>
              <label>6.</label>
              <item>I said we had possibly seen reflection of this in recent party declaration in
                  Moscow<note n="6" xml:id="d320fn6">Reference is to Declaration of the Communist
                  and Workers’ Parties, issued in Moscow on November 16, 1957.</note> which,
                however, seemed to repudiate some earlier postulates embodied in Belgrade
                Declaration of 1955 and Moscow Declaration of 1956<note n="7" xml:id="d320fn7"
                  >Regarding the Belgrade Declaration, see <ref target="#d251fn2">footnote 2,
                    Document 251</ref>. Regarding the Moscow Declaration, see <ref target="#d280fn5"
                    >footnote 5, Document 280</ref>.</note> which <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> had signed. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said
                anyone who read recent Party Manifesto in Moscow could readily see why Yugoslav
                delegation had not signed. Too many conclusions, however, should not be drawn from
                speculation in Western press. Yugoslavia stuck to positions it had enunciated
                although it was clear from Party Manifesto that there were differences of principle
                between it and USSR. Perspectives for Yugoslavia are somber, <persName
                  corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said, caught as it is between two blocs. He
                thought basic principles of Yugoslav foreign policy, seeking as it does a relaxation
                of tension, were right. Failure to make progress on disarmament was discouraging.
                Had West shown more confidence in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                earlier things might have been different. He though present international situation
                was extremely dangerous and hoped West would make renewed efforts to reach agreement
                with USSR. Yugoslavia would continue to work for solution on basis of its
                independent judgment and will continue its efforts to have good relations with both
                blocs. CP Manifesto should not be over-dramatized and it will take time for process
                in Soviet Union to become manifest.</item>

              <item>Returning to question of US-Yugoslav relations <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                  >Tito</persName> said he hoped economic relations could continue as before. He
                recalled hope he expressed last year that eventually he could get away from grants
                and move toward credit and loan basis. He said Yugoslav Government intends to do
                everything it can to intensify agricultural production so that it will not
                perpetually ask for grant aid. He was hopeful that within several years our economic
                relations would be expanded but on altered basis which would make it easier for
                both.</item>

            </list>
            <p>The Yugoslav Ambassador called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
              at his own request to discuss the conversation last Friday between Ambassador
                <persName corresp="#p_RJW1">Riddleberger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Marshal Tito</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">See <ref target="#d320"><hi
                    rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> He explained that he had come under
              instructions from his Government to repeat President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                >Tito</persName>’s remarks to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"
                >Riddleberger</persName> on the question of US military aid. Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> observed that this particular aid had in the past
              given rise to unfortunate statements, particularly in the US Congress, which did not
              contribute to good relations and had resulted generally in an “unpleasant atmosphere”.
              He recalled his meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> on
              January 8<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">Telegram 556 to Belgrade, January 9, summarized
                the <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_ML1"
                  >Mates</persName> discussion the previous day. (Department of State, Central
                Files, 758.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/12–2456)</note> when, he said, he
              had pointed out in connection with the then anticipated resumption of deliveries that
              it would be desirable if these deliveries could be effected at the rate originally
              contemplated and without further interruption. After deliveries were resumed in May of
              1957, he said, he had pointed out that the stretchout was in his personal view
              unfortunate. Since that time, his Government has given further consideration to the
              question, the Ambassador said, and has concluded that the political difficulties
              caused by <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0836"/>military aid now outweigh the value
              of the military equipment involved.</p>
            <p>In order that the termination of military aid may be carried out smoothly and without
              irritation on either side, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> said,
              President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had proposed that US and
              Yugoslav representatives meet in Belgrade to make necessary specific arrangements.</p>
            <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> observed that he saw no occasion
              for irritation, and that he appreciated the motivation for the Yugoslav proposal. He
              pointed out, however, that we had been surprised at the publicity which the whole
              question had received, particularly as this appears to have originated in Belgrade.
              This was difficult to understand, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
              said, since it was our understanding that the Yugoslavs had specifically requested
              that their proposal be kept secret. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName>
              replied, however, that he knew nothing about the publicity, that he too had been
              surprised, and that he had in fact intended to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> whether he knew anything about it.</p>
            <p>In closing the conversation on this topic Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                >Murphy</persName> asked, as he had once earlier in the conversation, whether we
              were correct in taking the Yugoslav decision to apply to all US military aid program,
              including end items, spare parts, training, etc. In his reply Mr. <persName
                corresp="#p_ML1">Mates</persName> made no distinction between end items and spare
              parts and training. He said it was his understanding that the decision extends to all
              military aid, all “military hardware” as he put it, that is, the entire military aid
              program.</p>

            <p>Popovic’s attitude seemed friendly and cooperative. He said this action was being
              taken by mutual consent and that this aspect should be stressed in any public
              discussion or announcement on the subject. He also mentioned the fact that this
              represented a step toward putting our relations with Yugoslavia on a “broader basis”
                <pb n="809" xml:id="pg_809" facs="0837"/>and referred to the difficulties which had
              been engendered by specific programs. He seemed rather vague on the steps necessary to
              implement this decision but promised to designate someone in the Foreign Office to
              follow the matter up. I pointed out to him some of the possible difficulties, chiefly
              those involving reassignment of <gloss target="#t_AMAS1">AMAS</gloss> personnel and
              the moving of some 100 families. He assured me that he could foresee no difficulties
              in this respect.</p>

              issuing immediate press statement to confirm decision of two governments to terminate
              military aid and then proceeded to read rapidly in French proposed draft statement. I
              replied that while I saw no objection to official confirmation of decision, I thought
              it might be preferable if both governments issued parallel statements at about same
              time in order to avoid misunderstanding. Foreign Secretary agreed and said he would
              send me proposed statement which Yugoslav Government would like to issue. Text of
              draft statement as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                <p>“Subsequent to the talks which were recently held between the representatives of
                  the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Federal
                  People’s Republic of Yugoslavia concerning the United States military aid to the
                  Government of the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia, the two governments
                  have agreed to terminate this aid. The two governments have also agreed that a
                  meeting should be held in the near future in order to solve technical questions
                  involved in the cessation of military aid.”</p>
              </quote></p>
            <p>This draft corresponds to the facts and we see no objection to its early
              issuance.</p>
