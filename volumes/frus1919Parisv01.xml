                <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>I know that I speak for the American people—and I have good reason to believe
                        I speak also for all the other peoples who fight with us—when I say that
                        this time we are determined not only to win the war but also to maintain the
                        security of the peace which will follow.</p>
                </quote>
                <p>These words, addressed to Congress on January 6, 1942, by the President of the
                    United States, serve to emphasize the conviction, which so many of us share,
                    that the achievement of the right kind of peace after the cessation of
                    hostilities is, like the winning of the war in the field, a major objective of
                    the American people. We fully understand that the just and stable order to which
                    we look forward can be realized only by judicious planning and skilled
                    execution. To that end we must not only study every phase of the international
                    structure of today but we must also draw upon the world’s last great experience
                    in peacemaking, the Paris settlement of 1919.</p>
                <p>Whether a more effective peace settlement in 1919 or a more effective execution
                    of that settlement would have saved us from the devastating war in which we are
                    now engaged is a question which it may not be possible even for the historians
                    of later generations to settle beyond a doubt. But irrespective of the verdict
                    of history it is imperative that we make every effort to avoid the pitfalls of
                    the period following the last war. To avoid those pitfalls it is necessary for
                    us to have at hand while the next world settlement is in the making, available
                    to the public and to responsible officials alike, full and authoritative
                    information on the peacemaking of 1919. The present is, therefore, an especially
                    appropriate time for the Department of State to fill an obvious gap in its <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series by publishing in this volume and
                    in the volumes to follow the official American records of the Paris Peace
                    Conference of 1919.</p>
                <p>None of the governments represented at Paris in 1919 has yet given a
                    substantially complete record of the Conference to the public, although there is
                    a large unofficial literature on the Conference already in existence. This
                    literature includes volumes of memoirs by distinguished participants and
                    collections of documents dealing with certain aspects of the work of the

                <p>The documents published in this edition are largely from the files of the
                    Department of State and those of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace,
                    whose extensive records are now also in the possession of the Department. A
                    certain number of closely related documents from other sources, whose
                    publication seemed desirable in the interest of completeness, have also been
                    included. Among these may be mentioned documents from the papers of <persName

                <p>It is intended that the volumes of the present series be arranged in three

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Volumes I and II, containing documents on the preliminary period
                            dealing with preparations for the Conference and the period between the
                            signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918, and the first meeting of
                            the Council of Ten on January 12, 1919.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Volumes III through X, containing minutes of the Plenary Sessions of
                            the Conference, the meetings of the representatives of the Powers with
                            Special Interests, and minutes of the meetings of the governing bodies
                            of the Conference, i. e., the Supreme Council in its various aspects:
                            the Council of Ten, Council of Four, Council of Foreign Ministers,
                            Council of Heads of Delegations, International Council of Premiers
                            (through its meeting of January 20, 1920), and Council of Ministers of
                            Foreign Affairs; and (in Volume X) minutes of meetings of the American
                            Commissioners Plenipotentiary and documents relating to the <pb n="V"

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Volume XI and following volumes, containing (1) minutes and reports of
                            the Commissions of the Conference, with other documents relating to the
                            same subjects, arranged in general in the order followed in the Treaty
                            of Versailles and the other peace treaties; (2) documents on the
                            negotiations with the enemy powers and the signature and ratification of
                            the treaties of peace; (3) documents concerning the negotiation of the
                            other treaties produced by the Paris Conference; and (4) documents
                            bearing on economic aspects of the work of the Conference, including
                            regulation of trade, the blockade, food relief, and the Supreme Economic
                            Council and its subordinate bodies.</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p rend="flushleft">With few exceptions the publication of documents will not be
                    carried beyond the period of active American participation in the Conference,
                    which ended with the departure from Paris of the American Commission to
                    Negotiate Peace on December 9, 1919.</p>
                <p>The principles being followed with regard to selection of material and inclusion
                    or exclusion of documents or parts of documents in the volumes are the same as
                    those which have governed in the preparation of earlier volumes of the <hi

                    the Division of Research and Publication. The volumes are being compiled in the
                    Research Section of the Division of Research and Publication by Dr.
                        <persName>James S. Beddie</persName>, Dr. <persName>Morrison B.
                        Giffen</persName>, and Mr. <persName>John W. Foley, Jr.</persName>, under
                    the immediate direction of Dr. <persName>Ernest R. Perkins</persName>. The
                    editorial work is directed by Miss <persName>Matilda F. Axton</persName>, the
                    principal editor of the Research Section. Those engaged upon the project are
                    deeply appreciative of the interest in and support of their work by Mr.
                        <persName>G. Howland Shaw</persName>, Assistant Secretary of State, and his
                    Executive Assistant, Mr. <persName>Laurence C. Frank</persName>. Many other
                    officers of the Department have cooperated generously in reviewing material and
                    in offering their papers for publication. Officers of the Library of Congress,
                    of Yale University, and of the <persName corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName>
                    Library on War, Revolution, and Peace have very kindly placed certain of their
                    collections at the disposal of the Department. The interest in the project so
                    frequently expressed by students of foreign policy throughout the country has
                    been an inspiration to the compilers.</p>

                        <p>I am deeply touched with your telegram. The share of America in the
                            victory you are celebrating is so great that never will any Frenchman
                            forget it. In the run of history, the ancient alliance of our two
                            countries was once more sealed by brotherhood in arms. The Americans and
                            French are united in these days of rejoicing as they were in the days of
                            fighting. I beg you to convey to the Federal Government the thanks of
                            France and of the Government of the Republic and to accept for yourself
                            who always evinced so much sympathy with my country my sentiments of
                            cordial friendship.</p>

                        <p>Accept my heartiest and warmest congratulations on the triumphant
                            conclusion of an armistice which we trust will lead to a peace, glorious

                        <p>By order of my Government I have the honour to express to the Government
                            of the United States the joy of the whole Greek Nation on the news of
                            the signature of the armistice which brings to an end the terrible war
                            by the triumph of the Nations who stood for right.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Nation at this solemn hour admires and appreciates at its just
                            value, the American contribution, which brought in at the most crucial
                            moment of the war, has been such a strong factor in conserving freedom
                            to the World.</p>
                        <p>The small nations, who would have been the easiest prey, and Greece
                            surely one of them, have not only seen their freedom secured by the
                            American intervention, but they furthermore expect to see the
                            reestablishment of their national unity. The United States are
                            henceforth their benefactor and they have gained their eternal
                            gratefulness.</p>
                        <p>The Greek nation is proud and happy to have been able to cooperate in
                            this great work. Greece wishes to assure the United States that she will
                            continue to join her endeavours to those of the American People in order
                            to contribute with the same devotion and faith at the construction of
                            the magnificent edifice of the Society of Nations.</p>

                            Government, and it will be read with profound appreciation throughout
                            the British Empire. We are proud to think that in the cause of
                            international freedom we, like our Allies, have worked and suffered,
                            fought and conquered side by side with the people of your great country.
                            May this unity of ideals bind us ever closer together through all the
                            generations to whom the Great War will be no more than an ancient and

                            and a more civilized future for all mankind. In the name of the people
                            and soldiers of Italy I express to you and your noble Nation the
                            sentiments of earnest admiration and the fervent wish that the memory of
                            the battles fought together may enhance the ties of lasting friendship
                            between our peoples.</p>

                            that the ideals of our two countries in regard to international
                            reconstruction are fundamentally the same and I feel sure that at the
                            forthcoming peace conference we shall be able to cooperate fruitfully to
                            promote the reign of peace with liberty and true democracy throughout

                            herself, and I am sure that I speak their heart in thanking Your Majesty
                            with sincerest warmth for your message, and in sending in return the

                                corresp="#p_WLH1">Woolsey</persName> and I have thought about and
                            talked about a bureau to be established for the study and preparation of
                            those questions which appear likely to be proposed at the Peace
                            Conference. We have thought that such work should be in charge of a
                            board to be composed of, <list>
                                <item>First, a high official of the Navy;</item>
                                <item>Second, the Naval Instructor;</item>
                                <item>Third, the head of the War College;</item>
                                <item>Fourth, some official of the Department of State to be
                                    designated by you;</item>
                                <item>Fifth, some expert on International Law—such as Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SJB1">Scott</persName>.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Under this board, and to serve as advisers to it, should be selected
                            persons who are experts in the different geological [<hi rend="italic"
                                >geographical</hi>] divisions of the work: such as Professor
                                <persName>Harper</persName> on Russia; someone on the Balkan States;
                            someone on Turkey and Persia; someone on Japan; someone on Germany and
                            Austria; someone on England, France and Belgium, and such others as may,
                            from time to time, develop as either necessary or expedient.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that the bureau—if the suggestion meets with your
                            approval—should be organized immediately but most quietly and that its
                            existence be not made known; that it should meet, not at the Department
                            of State, but at the War College, or some other place where it could be
                            concealed, and that it be furnished with all books and literature which
                            could be of any possible service to it.</p>
                        <p>Personally I feel that the Secretary of State should keep control of it
                            and of its operations; that it should report to the Secretary of State
                            and be under his directions. Whether this would be sufficiently insured
                            under the membership above proposed, cannot be definitely said, but it
                            could be made certain by adding one or more other persons to be
                            designated by the Secretary of State or it might be assured by having it
                            composed of five persons to be designated by the Secretary of Slate and
                            to have the military and naval representatives attached <pb n="10"
                                xml:id="pg_10" facs="0080"/>to it in an advisory capacity in the
                            same manner as the expert advisers above indicated.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry that I will not have an opportunity to speak to you about this
                            in person. I leave this memorandum for you and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WLH1">Woolsey</persName> will speak to you.</p>

                        <p>It is impossible in selecting negotiators to represent this Government at
                            the Peace Conference to find men who possess the full knowledge to deal
                            with the numerous and complex questions which will arise. It is
                            important, therefore, that they should be furnished beforehand with
                            information and data in a condensed form upon which they can rely in the
                            discussion of questions even though they may not be participants in all
                            the discussions.</p>
                        <p>To accomplish this purpose experts on the various probable subjects of
                            negotiation should be invited, with or without compensation, to prepare
                            brief, though comprehensive articles on these subjects, explaining to
                            the writers that the purpose is for the use of the representatives of
                            the United States at the Peace Conference and that, therefore, their
                            work must be kept secret.</p>
                        <p>The subjects in general would fall under the heads of History, Commerce,
                            and International Law. History would naturally be divided under the
                            various countries and could be developed along political, commercial,
                            industrial and military lines. Possibly it would be found advantageous
                            to group certain countries together in treating of their history, while
                            colonial possessions would require special treatment. Commerce would be
                            in a measure statistical but would involve the careful study of exports
                            and imports, markets and trade routes. International Law would cover a
                            wide range of subjects, relating to peace and war, such as maritime law,
                            rules of war, neutralization of land communication, internationalization
                            of waterways, extent of territorial waters, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Outside of these subjects which fall under the three heads named, there
                            are others which should be considered, such as disarmament,
                            international <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0081"/>guaranties and
                            their enforcement, arbitration, &amp;c. Possibly, too, it would be
                            advisable to have the constitutions and political institutions of the
                            countries carefully analyzed and commented upon.</p>
                        <p>Following out this general plan, which, if adopted, ought to be
                            elaborated with great care in order that the experts engaged would
                            understand the exact limits of their respective studies, a selection
                            should be made from the historians, political economists and jurists in
                            this country, who are especially qualified to deal with particular
                            subjects. Each should prepare a pamphlet of not to exceed 10,000 or
                            15,000 words on the topic assigned to him and these pamphlets after
                            being submitted to the person or persons having general charge of the
                            work of gathering information for the negotiators should be secretly
                            printed and carefully indexed for use when occasion arises.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these condensed articles it would probably be advisable to
                            have a collection of documents, statistics, quotations, &amp;c., which
                            would form appendices to the articles, but which should be indexed so
                            that they could be readily referred to. These appendices should also be
                            secretly printed.</p>
                        <p>Full instructions should also be prepared for each writer engaged on this
                            work explaining the method of treatment of the subject assigned to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The division of subjects, the selection of writers, the issuance of
                            instructions, the examination of articles and collected data, and the
                            direction of printing and indexing should be in the hands of one man,
                            who should have such assistants as he may require.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_BND1">N. D.
                                    B.</persName>
                            </hi>: I want to write you personally for your advice and
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that the question of reducing armaments will be thoroughly
                            agitated at the peace conference. By that time it will have become
                            something more than a humane agitation. Economically the nations cannot
                            support the present scale of expenditure and recover from the losses of
                            the war. For we have to remember that a case of armaments today is
                            immeasurably more burdensome than it was during the armed peace up to
                            1914. To return even to that scale would mean a radical proportionate
                            reduction. Recognition of <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0083"/>this
                            fact seems to be dawning upon statesmen in Central Europe, especially in
                            Austria, and undoubtedly gives a certain sincerity to their repeated
                            pleas.</p>
                        <p>I have been examining what literature is immediately available, and I can
                            find nothing which contains a practical and technical analysis of the
                            problem. Obviously the crux of the problem is how to prevent cheating by
                            subtle forms of mobilization. The line between normal industry and
                            semi-military preparation no longer exists, and as armament is relative,
                            one naturally suspects such obvious devices as limitation of budgets, of
                            capital ships, or the size of standing armies.</p>
                        <p>What is needed now is a creative study of the question by a group of men
                            who thoroughly understand modern military science. These men would be
                            required at the peace conference as technical advisers, not only on the
                            general question of reducing armaments but on the specific strategic
                            problems which will arise.</p>

                            </hi>: I have your letter of the 27th with regard to the reduction of
                            armaments question. I agree with you that it ought to be studied from
                            the points of view which you suggest, and that those who study it ought
                            to be headed by someone who would be available as a conferee at the
                            Paris Conference. Under all the circumstances I think I would rather
                            turn <persName corresp="#p_BGTH1">General Bliss</persName>’s mind loose
                            on this subject than anybody’s else. He is not at hand just now, but
                            when he comes back I will be glad to speak to him about it and let him
                            brood upon it, as he will do thoroughly. I think it would not be a bad
                            plan also to have General <persName>Crowder</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d21fn4">General <persName>Enoch H.

                                Army.</note> thinking about it, as he has a ruminating mind and will
                            take a good deal of pleasure in learning all the literature there is on
                            the subject; but perhaps it would be better to have <persName

                            />them independently in the matter, so that unless you want the study
                            started sooner I will let the matter go until <persName

                            </hi>: I have prepared a memorandum, which I enclose, giving a rough and
                            approximate outline of the subjects to be dealt with in The
                                Inquiry.<note n="5" xml:id="d25fn5">Attached to the file copy of
                                this letter are two memoranda, which are here printed as enclosures
                                1 and 2.</note> I have included only those which seem to be most
                            urgent and am sending the outline to you for your consideration and
                            suggestion when we next meet. Naturally, it only can embody a general
                            scheme which, if finally accepted, should be kept in mind in prosecuting
                            individual inquiries, but should not be allowed to interfere with the
                            variations in treatment which the nature of each inquiry, and even to
                            some extent the personality of each inquirer, would naturally render
                            desirable. The outline is an attempt to summarize the more important
                            points of agreement that resulted from our various conferences.</p>
                        <p>I think we made good progress at our meeting on Thursday, and have no
                            doubt that The Inquiry will continue satisfactorily. I am sending copies
                            of the memorandum to the other gentlemen who were present at the

                            for me to have a verbatim statement of the agreement that was at one
                            time contemplated between ourselves and other American republics looking
                            towards the mutual guarantee of sovereignty and territorial integrity,
                            and dealing, no doubt, with some other matters involved in these two
                            guarantees. Would it be possible for you to have one of your assistants
                            get and send me a statement of the contemplated agreement? I should, if
                            you think best, use it as a possible form of general international
                            agreement, without indicating that it was in contemplation an agreement
                            for this hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The point, of course, is that this is one of the types of international
                            cooperation that needs study, especially as it was worked out by our own

                            Republics which was under consideration about a year-and-a-half ago. You
                            will observe it is in the form of what might be called a “Pan American
                                Treaty”.<note n="6" xml:id="d28fn6">For papers previously printed on

                            </hi>: Thank you for letting me see the copy of your letter to the
                            President of the twenty-first.<note n="7" xml:id="d30fn7">Not found in
                                Inquiry files.</note> I thoroughly sympathize with the view you
                            express, although I had not thought of it before. I am reaching the
                            place, or have already reached it, where I feel that every energy must
                            be combined to make Germany livable after the war. By that I mean
                            livable to her own people as well as to the rest of the world. If a
                            “victorious peace” were achieved by the Allies and the German people
                            were condemned to intolerable domestic conditions of an economic kind
                            they would be worse, maybe, than they were before, and yet access to the
                            resources of civilization can be tolerated only upon assurances that can
                            be relied upon that <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0096"/>such
                            resources will be used in the interest of civilization when they are

                        <p>Now that a skeleton organization has been created it may be well to
                            examine the context of the inquiry.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>In all human probability the war will not at any one moment suddenly
                            terminate in a peace. Demobilization will not precede the peace
                            conference. It is not even likely that hostilities will cease during the
                            early stages of the discussion.</p>
                        <p>The probable course of events is already indicated. We may expect a peace
                            propaganda from Central Europe of increasing intensity calculated as
                            accurately as possible to allure the groups of the Allied Left at a
                            minimum of concessions. The minimum of actual concession will be covered
                            by formulas which approach more and more the verbal form of the war aims
                            outlined by the Left among the Allies. As the German proposals grow in
                            “moderation” there is a political movement in each of the Allied nations
                            towards its own left. The object of course is the division of the
                            coalition as between the nations and within the nations. Naturally the
                            German peace offensive is aimed at the weak points of the Alliance.
                            Those points are those where the aims of the Allies do not coincide and
                            within the nations the points where the
                            imperialist-nationalist-liberal-pacifist-cleavages are least
                            successfully covered.</p>

                            reduced the war spirit of Russia and opened a schism between Russia and
                            the Western Allies. That same resolution and the propaganda which

                            reluctant liberal support of the war in the Western Nations. The
                            Stockholm conference plan had a similar effect, and from its failure
                            dates the withdrawal of official labor and socialist support of the
                            French and British governments.</p>
                        <p>It must be noted that a parallel movement exists in Central Europe.
                            There, too, the strain within the Allies and between the Allies is
                            serious, and each move to seduce the Left among the Allies involves a
                            heavy pull upon the Right in Germany. How much of the concessive policy
                            of the German government is forced by the German Left, and how much is
                            deliberately preventive in order to forestall division at home, and how
                            much is carefully calculated to create division abroad, it is not
                            possible to estimate exactly. But this we do know—the German government
                            has succeeded thus far in maintaining a unity in <pb n="28"
                                xml:id="pg_28" facs="0098"/>Central Europe which is effective for
                            military purposes and has played with considerable result for the
                            weakening of the coalition.</p>
                        <p>The counter to this German effort has taken two forms. The first is
                            coercive and consists in the suppression and ostracism of any opinion
                            which is responsive to the concessive proposals from Central Europe.
                            This policy has had some success in the Western Nations, at least
                            temporarily, and may be even more successful in America as we become
                            heavily engaged in France. But it is a very costly policy and in the
                            long run, chiefly because it tends to accentuate class division into a
                            militaristic-pacific division as well; because it corrupts the war
                            spirit by inciting mob violence to drive out disinterested idealism;
                            because it establishes a mood which is recklessly hostile to a
                            constructive international policy. The other of the two methods by which
                            the German offensive is countered reached its expression in the
                            President’s reply to the <persName>Pope</persName>.<note n="9"

                            unify Central Europe in a tenacious defence psychology. This method
                            unifies the Allies by attraction, immensely enlarges the constituency of
                            the war, and because it acts to disintegrate Central Europe compels
                            increasing concession by the Bight to the Left. These concessions are,
                            of course, minimal and deceptive, but the assumption of power by a

                            shift in the balance of political power.</p>
                        <p>In enemy and friendly nations there is at this time a fierce political
                            struggle, not even concealed. The fact that the European Allies did not
                            themselves reply to the <persName>Pope</persName> is not to be taken as
                            complete acceptance by the governments of the President’s reply. It is
                            to be taken as an indication that the domestic political situations are
                            too tense for them to risk a discriminating reply. They were compelled
                            to avoid a debate which would have inevitably revealed grave differences
                            of opinion.</p>
                        <p>Resistance to declarations now of “peace terms” arises from a recognition
                            that once public opinion centers upon questions of territory, no bit of
                            territory will seem worth the cost of war. The actual struggle is waged
                            against the menace of the German army which has terrorized Europe and
                            the world, and the object of the battle is either to demonstrate that
                            the army can be beaten, or to inflict such pressure upon the German
                            nation as would result in a radical rejection of the groups now in
                            control of the Empire. Terms of peace are inevitably <pb n="29"
                                xml:id="pg_29" facs="0099"/>secondary to this purpose. To permit
                            them to occupy the center of discussion would cause morale to decline by
                            a substitution of mere territorial ambitions for this greater purpose. A
                            debate about territory now would reduce the war to the merely
                            nationalistic objects, and inevitably split the coalition.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately the difficulty seems to be this: The war is waged by many
                            nations against an international menace. Those who are directing that
                            war have not centered upon this international fact but retain it in
                            their consciousness and as part of their motive.</p>
                        <p>These divergencies of purpose in the coalition are no doubt the ultimate
                            cause of an unco-ordinated strategy. The logic of nationalist absolutism
                            is to stake more and more on victory, and to increase the prize as the
                            effort requires sacrifice. The Western Allies are in the control of
                            absolute nationalists, the stability of whose own power depends upon the
                            realization of certain large promises. Therefore in official circles
                            there has been a recession of interest in what may be called the program
                            of an enduring peace, the program for which the workers, the farmers,
                            the small capitalists and the liberal intellectuals of Western Europe
                            and America accepted the war. This heavy emphasis on nationalist success
                            in each country has brought its government into conflict with the
                            governments of the Allies. As between Russia and the West it appears to
                            have opened up an era of tragic misunderstanding. For Italy it has meant
                            a curious isolation which appears to have led her to military disaster
                            in a spectacular effort to secure sympathy and assistance. Thus, because
                            the Allies distrusted Italy’s political ambitions, and her
                            unco-operative method of pursuing them, her military zone was in a
                            measure disregarded and the supplies needed for an offensive to complete
                            Italy’s purposes were not furnished. To secure those supplies Italy
                            appears to have overextended her front and exposed her flank. A similar
                            political blunder upon the part of Rumania appears to have led her to
                            disaster.</p>
                        <p>Unity of strategy, especially if the war is prolonged, will depend upon a
                            simplification and pooling of purposes in both coalitions, the enemies’
                            and our own. This involves a shifting of political power from those who
                            now control all the nations of Western Europe and Central Europe so that
                            the governments represent both in personnel, in social outlook and in
                            patriotic purpose the middle parties. Unity will involve placating the
                            moderate left even at the cost of opposition from the irreconcilable
                            right. In both coalitions unity will depend increasingly upon this
                            movement toward the left. The movement, of course, need not be parallel
                            or at the same rate. In each country it is relative to the position now
                            occupied by the controlling groups.</p>
                        <p>But the two movements react upon each other almost like the bidding at an
                            auction. The price of unity is increased in each nation as the
                            liberalism of the enemy increases. But as the governing groups have <pb
                                n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0100"/>staked themselves on particular
                            nationalist successes, this competition in liberalism cuts under the
                            whole social regime which they represent. They resist liberalization of
                            purpose, and so, while they disintegrate their own people, they make it
                            easier for the enemy to hold together.</p>
                        <p>This political situation bears most heavily on our own success in the
                            war. Excluding for the purposes of argument the invention of some
                            brilliant tactical or strategical novelty, the military decision must be
                            reached on the Western Front by an attempt to exhaust Germany’s
                            reserves. No immediate spectacular success is expected. This involves an
                            unprecedented strain on morale and resources which can be met only by
                            the most successful kind of moral and administrative economy in Western
                            Europe and the United States. This is to be had only by keeping
                            political power upon the broadest basis of popular consent and by a
                            powerful counter-offensive in diplomacy to reveal deceptive liberalism
                            in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Without this we may expect Germany’s skilful seduction to succeed
                            sufficiently to bring about moral disunion followed by administrative
                            waste and military weakness. Larger and larger areas of the front would
                            then grow torpid as the Russian, Rumanian, Macedonian, Caucasus,
                            Mesopotamian and Gaza fronts now are, and as the Italian may very
                            possibly be.</p>
                        <p>We may assume that following the conclusion of the Italian campaign
                            Germany will attempt this winter to force a peace discussion aimed to
                            disintegrate the Allied morale before the opening of the spring and
                            summer fighting. The Allies, on the other hand, will resist this peace
                            offensive during the winter, and will this summer try to force a German
                            retirement behind the Meuse and the Scheldt, and will begin at least a
                            tentative invasion of Germany through Lorraine. Until this occurs a very
                            tight hand will be kept on peace discussion in Western Europe and
                            America. If it occurs, the military decision will have been reached and
                            the German army’s prestige will be sufficiently reduced to permit
                            negotiation and discussion. This will be the decision. It will consist
                            of the destruction of the submarine bases, the recapture of northern
                            France, and a potential invasion at least of German territory. The
                            deeper decision, however, will consist in the relative reserves of men.
                            For when the new lines are established at the end of the 1918 campaign
                            Germany will face the military reconquest of Lorraine at the time when
                            the American reserve is becoming an actuality.</p>
                        <p>If such a decision is reached it will probably not be pressed to any
                            ultimate conclusion. Negotiations will begin on the new line, and with
                            the Allies in control of the outer world and, therefore, of all the
                            materials essential to German reconstruction.</p>

                        <p>The motive which will probably control all others in the minds of
                            European statesmen will be how to obtain the means of recuperation.
                            Unless they are found revolutionary discontent will accompany
                            demobilization. This will be intensified by the fact that the disbanding
                            of armies is a slow process, and must be accompanied by violent
                            discontent once the pressure of the enemy is removed. Slow
                            demobilization will produce an insurrectionary spirit in those detained
                            too long after hostilities cease. Quick demobilization will produce an
                            economic crisis unless raw materials, transportation, markets, credit
                            are in proper working order. The competition for these facilities will
                            be immediate and intense, and the power to allocate them will be the
                            strongest of all instruments of negotiation. No territory in that belt
                            which stretches from the-Baltic through the Balkans to the Persian Gulf
                            (the chief area of debatable territory) is as immediately important as
                            access to and use of sea-borne materials. If the Powers which control
                            the outer communications have a policy of national autonomy and
                            international organization to enforce, this is the only means by which
                            it can be done. For though a military decision is obtained in the West,
                            this great disputed belt of peoples will almost surely remain at the end
                            of the war within the German lines.</p>
                        <p>The President has many times emphasized the fact that the supremacy of
                            Germany throughout the Near East represents her victory thus far. This
                            supremacy can scarcely be disputed from the East with Russia weak. The
                            acceptance of the Reichstag Resolution by all but the extreme
                            Pan-Germans is based unquestionably upon this fact, and it is highly
                            significant that the German Foreign Secretary, <persName>von
                                Kühlmann</persName>, should be himself one of the chief promoters of
                            the Bagdad railway. The men he represents undoubtedly see that German
                            prestige east of the French boundary assures them a mastery of the
                            points which control the approaches to three continents.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, one overpowering difficulty in the way, and that is
                            the blockade. The Near East, even with Russia added as an economic
                            colony, is still an inchoate empire which would require perhaps a
                            generation of peace and economic resource to organize. Although the
                            enthusiasts for Mittel-Europa write as if it could be a closed economic
                            system, soberer criticism has shown them that this is an impossibility.
                            Middle Europe must, in the immediate future at least, draw essential
                            supplies of reconstruction from the outer world. To pay for those

                        <p>There appear to be two schools of German imperialism at the present time,
                            represented perhaps by the Fatherland Party and by the
                            Kühlmann-Helfferich groups. They differ considerably in tone, in
                            domestic policies, perhaps even in spiritual values. But there is a
                            tacit agreement on two points: (1) that Germany’s immediate future is
                            the domination of the eastern part of the continent; (2), that this
                            domination depends upon access to the supplies of the outer world. It is
                            upon the method of attaining the second point that they really disagree.
                            Kühlmann and his group wish to attain it by “accommodation”, by a
                            reconciliation with the western nations which at the present time is
                            equivalent to a surrender of the Near East to the Germans. They count
                            shrewdly that the anti-German coalition would have even less unity of
                            action in peace than it has had in war and that German methods of
                            competition would be irresistible in a world that was exhausted and in a
                            sense demoralized by inability to win when the odds were in its favor.
                            They believe they would secure their supplies from over-seas and
                            dominate the Near East without serious resistance. The Fatherland Party,
                            on the other hand, believes that this access to the outer world must be
                            established by military and naval power, and maintained by constant
                            threat of force.</p>
                        <p>That is why this party insists on retaining Belgium. That is why the
                            struggle in Germany centers on Belgium. It is a contest between two
                            schools of imperialism. The moderate Kühlmann school is assisted by the
                            German Socialists because its plan of accommodation seems quicker to
                            attain and does not imply a continuation of heavy armaments. This school
                            consists of the really practical men of Germany who understand that
                            recuperation is impossible without a reduction of military expenses and
                            freedom from the threat of war.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons Belgium has become the pivot of German policy.
                            Obviously the control of Belgium, besides its commercial advantages,
                            would make it possible for Germany to prevent England ever again landing
                            an army in France and would thus leave France absolutely at her mercy.
                            This is probably even a stronger motive than the control of submarine
                            bases. It is interesting to note that Bethmann,<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d32fn11">Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, German Imperial
                                Chancellor, 1909–17.</note> who tried to preserve party unity,
                            frequently toyed with the idea of an “administrative division of
                            Belgium”. Such a division would mean Flemish administration of the
                                <persName>Flanders</persName> coast with the possibility at least
                            that the Flemings could be drawn into the orbit of German influence.</p>
                        <p>Immediate recuperation through access to supplies, followed by the
                            organization of the Near East, is the probable policy from which German
                                <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0103"/>peace plans arise. The

                        <p>This organization assembles the material, which is then deposited with

                            direction a staff for the filing and digesting of the material. The plan
                            adopted here provides for an editing of the material by Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSE1">Mezes</persName> and Mr. <persName

                            by the Belgian Institute of Bibliography. Under this system it will be
                            possible to collect the material <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0105"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Keogh</persName> will also act as librarian of the Inquiry,
                            assembling documents and materials on any points which are called for.
                            He will be in a position to state where any material published is to be

                        <p>The administrative machinery of the Inquiry is now in running condition,
                            and is planned so that the Central Committee is immediately in touch

                        <p>The personnel of these collaborators and assistants is representative of

                            prepared, and should be completed at the end of January, a preliminary
                            survey of the chief sources of economic strength and weakness of the
                            nations participating in the settlement. A study of the existing
                            machinery, administrative and legislative, preventing free economic
                            intercourse between the nations which might be used either to maintain

                            position, the shipping situation, the industrial needs, and the
                            industrial possibilities of the major powers. A study is being prepared

                                <item>There are a number of ways in which this might be done. We
                                    might follow the English model and establish a Reconstruction
                                    Bureau in Washington. The objections to this are obvious. It
                                    would create an immense amount of gossip and speculation and
                                    would be besieged by dogmatists and special interests. A better
                                    way, it seems to me, would be to do it quietly, along the lines
                                    we are pursuing in collecting reference data for the peace
                                    conference. The method would have this advantage, that it would
                                    enable us to consider internal problems in their relation to
                                    international conditions.</item>

                                <item>In working out the organization of the Inquiry, we are
                                    canvassing the expert resources of the country as they relate to
                                    social problems. It would be entirely feasible, I believe, for
                                    the Inquiry to expand into this other field without straining
                                    it. The method of assembling data would be much the same, the
                                    machinery for editing and digesting would require no essential
                                    change. We should need a somewhat larger central office force,
                                    six or eight more men to direct the research, and from
                                    twenty-five to fifty thousand dollars to cover payments to

                        </p>
                        <p>The Allies have had various opportunities to destroy Middle Europe by
                            arms, to wit: the Russian invasion of Alicia, the protection of Serbia,
                            the intervention of Rumania, the offensive of Italy, the expedition at
                            Gallipot, the expedition to Salonika, the Mesopotamia campaign, and the
                            Palestinian campaign. The use made of these opportunities has produced
                            roughly the following results: The Russian army has ceased to be an
                            offensive force, and Germany occupies a large part of that territory of
                            the Russian Empire which is inhabited by more or less non-Russian
                            peoples; Rumania is occupied to the mouth of the Danube; Serbia and
                            Montenegro are occupied; the Austrian and German are deep into Italian
                            territory. As the Russian, Rumanian, Serbian, and Italian armies cannot
                            be expected to resume a dangerous offensive, the invasion of
                            Austria-Hungary has ceased to be a possibility. The Allies hold
                            Saloniki, which they are unable to use as a base for offensive
                            operations. There is danger that they may be driven from it. If they are
                            able to hold it, and to keep it from Austrian hands, they have made a
                            blind alley of one subordinate part of the Berlin-Bagdad project, which
                            has always included a branch line to Saloniki, and then to the sea. By
                            the capture <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0112"/>of Bagdad they not
                            only control the rich resources of Mesopotamia but have made a blind
                            alley of the main Berlin-Bagdad line, so far as that line was aimed to
                            be a line of communication to the Persian Gulf as a threat against
                            India. By the capture of Palestine the British have nullified a
                            subordinate part of the Berlin-Bagdad scheme, that is, the threat to the
                            Suez Canal. By the almost complete separation of Arabia from Turkey, the
                            Turks have not only lost the Holy Cities, but another threat to the Red
                            Sea has been removed. Germany has therefore lost the terminals of her
                            project, and if Saloniki, Jerusalem, Bagdad, and Arabia remain in
                            non-German hands the possibilities of defense against the
                            politico-military portions of the Bagdad scheme exist.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The problem is therefore reduced to this: How effectively is it possible
                            for Germany to organize the territory now under her political and
                            military influence so as to be, in a position at a later date to
                            complete the scheme and to use the resources and the manpower of Middle
                            Europe in the interests of her own foreign policy? She faces here four
                            critical political problems: 1) The Poles; 2) the Czechs; 3) the South
                            Slavs; and 4) Bulgaria. The problem may be stated as follows: If these
                            peoples become either the willing accomplices or the helpless servants
                            of Germany and her political purposes, Berlin will have established a
                            power in Central Europe which will be the master of the continent. The
                            interest of the United States in preventing this must be carefully
                            distinguished before our objectives can become clear. It can be no part
                            of our policy to prevent a free interplay of economic and cultural
                            forces in Central Europe. We should have no interest in thwarting a
                            tendency toward unification. Our interest is in the disestablishment of
                            a system by which adventurous and imperialistic groups in Berlin and
                            Vienna and Budapest could use the resources of this area in the interest
                            of a fiercely selfish foreign policy directed against their neighbors
                            and the rest of the world. In our opposition to Middle Europe,
                            therefore, we should distinguish between the drawing together of an area
                            which has a certain economic unity, and the uses of that unity and the
                            methods by which it is controlled. We are interested primarily in the
                            nature of the control.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The present control rests upon an alliance of interest between the ruling
                            powers at Vienna, Budapest, Sofia, Constantinople, and Berlin. There are
                            certain common interests which bind these ruling groups together. The
                            chief ones are: 1) the common interests of Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest
                            in the subjection of the Poles, the Czechs, and the Croats; 2) from the
                            point of view of Berlin the <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0113"
                            />present arrangement assures a control of the external affairs and of
                            the military and economic resources of Austria-Hungary; 3) from the
                            point of view of Vienna and Budapest it assures the German-Magyar
                            ascendency; 4) the interest that binds Sofia to the alliance lay chiefly
                            in the ability of Germany to exploit the wrong done Bulgaria in the
                            treaty of Bucharest; 5) the interest of Constantinople is no doubt in
                            part bought, in part coerced, but it is also in a measure due to the
                            fact that in the German alliance alone lies the possibility of even a
                            nominal integrity for the Turkish Empire; 6) at the conclusion of the
                            war, the greatest tie which will bind Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and
                            Turkey to Germany will be the debts of these countries to Germany.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The commercial control of the outer world, and the possibility of German
                            exclusion both from the sources of raw materials and the <pb n="44"
                                xml:id="pg_44" facs="0114"/>richer markets, and from the routes of
                            communication, lie in our hands. The possibility of a continued
                            commercial exclusion weighs heavily, in fact, most heavily of all, upon
                            the German mind at present, because upon the conclusion of peace a
                            successful demobilization is possible only as there are raw materials
                            and markets for the resumption of German industry. Without these the
                            army would become a discontented and dangerous body. If the possibility
                            of exclusion from economic opportunity is associated with a vision of a
                            world co-operation realized, the double motives of fear and hope can be
                            used upon the German people. This is our strongest weapon, and the
                            Germans realize its menace. Held over them, it can win priceless
                            concessions. It should be noted that this weapon will be of special
                            advantage after the peace conference has assembled. Our ability to
                            protract the discussion at the industrial expense of Germany and to our
                            own benefit, and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] will give us a bargaining
                            power of great advantage. Skilfully handled, this asset can be used both
                            to threaten and to lure them; and its appeal is wellnigh universal, as
                            the utterances and comment from Germany clearly show. To the dynasty and
                            the ruling classes, it presents the most tangible threat of revolution,
                            because it is obvious that the danger of revolution will be enormously
                            increased upon the conclusion of peace, when the patriotic motive
                            subsides. To the commercial classes it presents the obvious picture of
                            financial ruin and of disorder. To the army it presents the picture of a
                            long period following the conclusion of the war in which government will
                            not dare to demobilize rapidly. To the poorer classes generally it
                            presents the picture of a long period after the war in which the present
                            hardships will continue.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">II. <hi rend="italic">Our assets in
                                Austria-Hungary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Austria-Hungary we have a number of assets which may seem
                            contradictory at first, but which can all be employed at the same time.
                            There is the nationalistic discontent of the Czechs and probably of the
                            South Slavs. The increase of nationalistic discontent among the Czechs
                            and the possibility of some kind of Poland will tend to break the
                            political coalition which has existed between the Austrian Poles and the
                            German Austrians. On the part of the Emperor and of the present ruling
                            powers in Austria-Hungary there is a great desire to emerge from the war
                            with the patrimony of <persName>Francis Joseph</persName> unimpaired.
                            This desire has taken two interesting forms: 1) it has resulted in the
                            adoption of a policy of no annexations, which is obvious enough; and 2)
                            in the adoption, evidently with much sincerity, of a desire for
                            disarmament and a league of nations. The motive here is evidently a
                            realization that financially Austria cannot maintain armaments at the
                            present scale after the war, and a realization that in a league of <pb
                                n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0115"/>nations she would find a
                            guarantee of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. It follows that the
                            more turbulent the subject nationalities become and the less the present
                            Magyar-Austrian ascendency sees itself threatened with absolute
                            extinction, the more fervent will become the desire in Austria-Hungary
                            to make itself a fit partner in a league of nations. Our policy must
                            therefore consist first in a stirring up of nationalist discontent, and
                            then in refusing to accept the extreme logic of this discontent, which
                            would be the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary. By threatening the
                            present German-Magyar combination with nationalist uprisings on the one
                            side, and by showing it a mode of safety on the other, its resistance
                            would be reduced to a minimum, and the motive to an independence from
                            Berlin in foreign affairs would be enormously accelerated.
                            Austria-Hungary is in the position where she must be good in order to
                            survive.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the danger of economic exclusion after the war
                            affects Austria-Hungary as well as Germany very seriously, and no amount
                            of ultimate trade in transit to Turkey will be able to solve for her the
                            immediate problem of finding work for her demobilized army, of
                            replenishing her exhausted supplies, and of finding enough wealth to
                            meet her financial burdens.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In regard to Bulgaria our greatest asset is the possibility of satisfying
                            her just claims, now that the threat of an imperialistic Russian
                            occupation of Constantinople is removed. A satisfied Bulgaria would no
                            doubt share in the economic advantages of Middle Europe, but without a
                            strong national grievance of her own, her exploitation for political and
                            military purposes is improbable. To this should be added the
                            consideration that the reverberations of the Russian revolution are sure
                            to be felt in Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">IV. <hi rend="italic">Our assets in Turkey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In regard to Turkey our primary assets are our military successes,
                            already commented upon above. These military successes should have a
                            religio-political effect upon the Ottoman Turk. The great financial and
                            economic weakness of Turkey immediately after the war and her need of
                            assistance are also assets to be considered.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is often overlooked that the Russian revolution, inspired as it is by
                            deep hatred of autocracy, contains within it at least three other <pb
                                n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0116"/>great motives of serious danger
                            to German domination: 1) anti-capitalist feeling, which would be fully
                            as intense, or more intense, against German capitalism; 2) a religious
                            love of Russia which is spiritually antagonistic to Protestant Germany;
                            and 3) a powerful nationalist feeling among the Moderates, who will
                            either return to power or at least exercise a strong influence in
                            Russia. The revolution, therefore, must be regarded not only as
                            inherently difficult for the Germans to manage and to master, but as
                            being in itself a great dissolving force through its sheer example. Note
                            in this regard the reported interpellation of a deputy in the Austrian
                            parliament, who wanted to know when the Austrian and Hungarian landed
                            estates were to be broken up upon Bolsheviki principles, seeing that the
                            government had recognized the Bolsheviki.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Vatican has been rightly regarded as pro-German in its neutrality.
                            But we should not be misled in regard to it as we have been misled in
                            regard to the Russian revolution. The Germans have been skilful enough
                            to use it. The Vatican is one of those forces in the world which require
                            exceedingly skilful handling, and contains within it the possibility of
                            great assistance to our cause, as is shown, for example, by the
                            opportunity it offered the President to carry on the first successful
                            diplomatic offensive made by the Allies since the beginning of the
                            war.</p>

                        <p>The fact that with time the man-power and resources of this country,
                            added to the present forces of the Entente, render a complete and
                            crushing military victory over the Central Powers a certainty.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>To be counted on our side if skilfully used are certain intangibles which
                            the President undoubtedly had in mind when he warned the statesmen of
                            the world in his last message that they were living “in this midday hour
                            of the world’s life.” These are: 1) the universal longing for peace,
                            which under the circumstances should not be handed over to Germany as
                            something for them to capitalize; 2) the almost universal feeling on the
                            part of common people of the world that the old diplomacy is bankrupt,
                            and that the system of the armed peace must not be restored. This is a
                            sentiment fundamentally anti-Prussian in its nature, and should be
                            capitalized for our side; 3) there is then, too, a great hope of a
                            league of nations which has the approbation of disinterested people
                            everywhere; 4) there is the menace of social revolution all over the
                            world, and as a factor in it a realization by the governing political
                            and financial groups that the meeting of the war debts is virtually
                            insoluble without revolutionary <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0117"
                            />measures about property. In a war fought for democratic aims, these
                            fears should be made to fight on our side.</p>

                        <p>In estimating the objects of German policy, as well as the concessions
                            which Germany offers, it should be borne in mind that her first economic
                            and political penetration pointed due south through Italy, that later it
                            swerved southeast towards Constantinople, Bagdad, and the Persian Gulf,
                            and that at present, in view of the Russian debacle, its direction of
                            easiest advance is due east. The present is the best time for Germany to
                            seize the opportunities offering themselves there, and this may very
                            well cause her to decide that she will accept sacrifices towards the
                            southeast, the west, on other continents, and in distant seas, in order

                            nationalistic reasons. The abandonment by Italy of her imperialist
                            claims can be covered by strong assurances that her territory shall be
                            evacuated and her pressing economic needs now and after the war
                            assured.</p>

                        <p>Towards Austria-Hungary the approach should consist of references to the
                            subjection of the various nationalities, in order to keep that agitation
                            alive, but coupled with it should go repeated assurances that no
                            dismemberment of the Empire is intended, together with allusions to the
                            humiliating vassalage of the proudest court in Europe. It will probably
                            be well to inject into the discussion a mention of the fact that
                            Austria-Hungary is bound to Germany by huge debts expended in the
                            interest of German ambition. In regard to Austria-Hungary it will
                            probably not be wise to suggest frankly the cancellation of these debts,
                            as in the case of Turkey. Reference to their existence and to the
                            bondage which they imply will, however, produce a useful ferment. The
                            desire of Austria-Hungary to discuss the question of disarmament should
                            not be ignored. The discussion should specifically be accepted and the

                        <p>As against Germany the lines of the offensive have already been laid down
                            by the President. There should be more explicit assertion that the

                            exclusion from freedom of intercourse after the war, that the reward for
                            democratization is a partnership of all nations in meeting the problems
                            that will follow the peace. This offensive should of course contain the
                            explicit assurance that we do not intend to dictate the form of
                            responsible government in Germany, and that we are quite within the
                            justified limits of intercourse with nations if we take the position
                            that our attitude towards a responsible Germany would be different from
                            our attitude towards the present Germany.</p>

                            which will show the way to the Liberals in Great Britain and in France,
                            and therefore restore their national unity of purpose. These Liberals
                            will readily accept the leadership of the President if he undertakes a
                            liberal diplomatic offensive, because they will find in that offensive
                            an invaluable support for their internal domestic troubles; finally 3)
                            such a powerful liberal offensive on the part of the United States will
                            immensely stimulate American pride and interest in the war, and will
                            assure the administration the support of that great mass of the American
                            people who desire an idealistic solution. Such a liberal offensive will
                            do more than any other thing to create in this country the sort of
                            public opinion that the President needs in order to carry through the

                            war, while giving all possible moral support to France in her effort to
                            regain the provinces. It is now our belief that the recovery, of
                            Alsace-Lorraine is highly desirable and practically essential to the

                            destruction of German militarism. At the same time, we recognize that
                            America cannot insist upon fighting for Alsace-Lorraine longer than
                            France herself is willing to fight, and therefore if Germany should
                            offer France a compromise which France herself was willing to accept, it
                            would be unwise for us to have a commitment on record which we could not

                            however, may tentatively be kept in mind. They are in brief these: 1)
                            that the area annexed by Rumania in the Dobrudja<note n="†"
                                xml:id="d35fn16">In the treaty of Bucharest. [Footnote in the

                            be returned; 2) that the boundary between Bulgaria and Turkey should be
                            restored to the Enos-Midia line, as agreed upon at the conference of
                                London;<note n="‡" xml:id="d35fn17">And in the treaty of San
                                Stefano. [Footnote in the original.]</note> 3) that the south
                            boundary of Bulgaria should be the Aegean Sea coast from Enos to the
                            gulf of Orfano, and should leave the mouth of the Struma river in
                            Bulgarian territory; 4) that the best access to the sea for Serbia is
                            through Saloniki; 5) that the final disposition of Macedonia cannot be
                            determined without further inquiry; 6) that an independent Albania is
                            almost certainly an undesirable political entity.</p>
                        <p>We are strongly of the opinion that in the last analysis economic
                            considerations will outweigh nationalistic affiliations in the Balkans,
                            and that a settlement which insures economic prosperity is most likely
                            to be a lasting one.</p>

                        <p>An independent and democratic Poland shall be established. Its boundaries
                            shall be based on a fair balance of national and economic
                            considerations, giving full weight to the necessity for adequate access
                            to the sea. The form of Poland’s government and its economic and
                            political relations should be left to the determination of the people of
                            Poland acting through their chosen representatives.</p>
                        <p>The subject of Poland is by far the most complex of all the problems to
                            be considered. The present distribution of Poles is such as to make
                            their complete unification impossible without separating East Prussia
                            from Germany. This is probably not within the bounds of practical
                            politics. A Poland which consists essentially of Russian and perhaps
                            Austrian Poland would probably secure its access to the sea through the
                            Vistula River and the canals of Germany which run to Hamburg and Bremen.
                            This relationship would very probably involve both <pb n="52"
                                xml:id="pg_52" facs="0122"/>the economic subjection of Poland and
                            the establishment of an area of great friction. If Russia is to remain
                            weak the new Poland will lie in an exceedingly exposed position. The
                            experiment must no doubt be made, however, but in order to assure it a
                            fair start, it is necessary to insist at the outset upon a democratic
                            basis for the Polish state. Unless this is loyally observed, the
                            internal friction of Poles, Ruthenians, and Jews is likely to render
                            Poland impotent in the presence of Germany.</p>

                        <p>We see promise in the discussions now going on between the
                            Austro-Hungarian Governments and the peoples of the monarchy, but the
                            vassalage of Austria-Hungary to the masters of Germany, riveted upon
                            them by debts for money expended in the interests of German ambition,
                            must be done away with in order that Austria-Hungary may be free to take
                            her rightful place among the nations.</p>
                        <p>The object of this is to encourage the present movement towards
                            federalism in Austria, a movement which, if it is successful, will break
                            the German-Magyar ascendency. By injecting the idea of a possible
                            cancellation of the war debts, it is hoped to encourage all the
                            separatist tendencies as between Austria-Hungary and Germany, as well as
                            the social revolutionary sentiment which poverty has stimulated.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is necessary to free the subject races of the Turkish Empire from
                            oppression and misrule. This implies at the very least autonomy for
                            Armenia and the protection of Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia
                            by the civilized nations. It is necessary also to establish free
                            intercourse through and across the straits. Turkey proper must be justly
                            treated and freed from economic and political bondage. Her war debts to
                            Germany must be cancelled. None of the money involved was spent in the
                            interest of Turkey, and none of it should be regarded as a Turkish
                            obligation. An adjustment of her pre-war debt in accordance with her
                            territorial limitations is also required by the considerations of
                            justice. Moreover, it will undoubtedly be feasible to arrange advances
                            of money to Turkey in order to enable her under suitable supervision to
                            institute and maintain satisfactory educational and sanitary conditions,
                            and to undertake her economic rehabilitation. Thus Turkey can be freed
                            from intermeddling and enabled to develop institutions adapted to the
                            genius of her own people.</p>
                        <p>This will appear on the surface to be a drastic solution of the Turkish
                            problem, but it is one which the military situation enables us to
                            accomplish, and it can hardly be doubted that no principle of <pb n="53"
                                xml:id="pg_53" facs="0123"/>justice requires the return of occupied
                            portions of Turkey to the German-Turkish alliance. The cancellation of
                            Turkey’s debt to Germany is the one final way to abolish German
                            political and commercial penetration. It is also the one method by which
                            Turkey can be given a new start, considerably reduced in size, without
                            power to misgovern alien races, and therefore free to concentrate upon
                            the needs of her own population. It should be noted in this regard that
                            only a few days ago it was announced that Germany had agreed to forego
                            interest on the Turkish debt for a period of twelve years after the war.
                            This implies a realization on Germany’s part that if she insists upon
                            the interest payments a repudiation is possible, carrying with it a
                            destruction of German influence in Turkey.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>From the nations at present engaged in resistance to Germany’s effort to
                            dominate the world there is growing a League of Nations for common
                            protection, for the peaceful settlement of international disputes, for
                            the attainment of a joint economic prosperity, including equal
                            opportunity upon the highways of the world and equitable access to the
                            raw materials which all nations need. Whether this League is to remain
                            armed and exclusive, or whether there is to be a reduction of armaments
                            and a cordial inclusion of Germany, will depend upon whether the German
                            Government is in fact representative of the German democracy.</p>
                        <p>This is of course simply another statement of the alternative before
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>We regard all of the terms mentioned as essential to any final agreement.
                            It may well be, however, that some of the provisions other than those
                            relating to Belgium and northern France, the evacuation of Italy and
                            Rumania, and the evacuation and restoration of Serbia and Montenegro, do
                            not require assent as a preliminary to discussion at the conference. And
                            this is due to the fact that we have the power to compel Germany’s
                            assent at the peace conference by our ability to bar her indefinitely
                            from access to supplies and to protract the negotiations at her cost and
                            at our own benefit.</p>
                        <p>We emphasize our belief that no surrender of this power, even by
                            inference, should be considered until all the terms stated above are
                            definitely agreed to, in detail as well as in principle, by Germany at
                            the peace conference. This involves adopting as our policy the reserving
                            of the discussion of economic peace until our political, social, and
                            international objects are attained.</p>
                        <p>We might well adopt as our slogan “No economic peace until the peoples
                            are freed.”</p>

                            confine ourselves to special studies in international law, with one
                            object in mind—the working out of proposals for the future. Naturally
                            this will involve a good deal of study of the present experience, but it
                            would not involve our making ourselves expert on the legal negotiations
                            now in progress. We should then want to consider merely legal aspects of
                            such problems as a possible league of nations, the internationalization
                            of the Dardanelles, the protection of racial minorities in the Balkans,
                            Turkey, and Austria-Hungary, access to the sea for land-locked states,
                            the internationalization of certain railroads, rivers, and ports, the
                            “freedom of the seas,” the reduction of armaments. In general one might
                            say that our interest would be in those questions of international law
                            which are involved in future political relations rather than in the
                            immediate negotiations now in progress.</p>

                            rooms, and the whole of your spacious top floor, rearranged to meet our
                            need; have been served by your attendants; and given invaluable and
                            expert assistance by your competent collaborators. A number of other
                            centers have contributed highly appreciated aid in the carrying on of
                            our work for the Government, but none has done more than you have.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Inquiry is to secure command of the data which may be
                            needed in the course of the negotiations at the peace conference.
                            Obviously this cannot be acquired by the compilation of a new
                            encyclopaedia or of a series of monographs. It is clear that the
                            American negotiators will not have time to read extensive treatises. It
                            is also clear that no treatise planned now would necessarily be in a
                            form pertinent to the actual negotiations when they are in progress. No
                            one can foresee at this time the order in which data will be
                            requisitioned, nor the ideas about which the data will have to be
                            grouped in the course of the negotiations. Whatever facts are assembled
                            must clearly be under such control that they can be arranged and grouped
                            and presented in almost any form at the shortest possible notice.</p>
                        <p>The first condition is the reliability of the material. Under the complex
                            and shifting conditions, reliability means not only a critical use of
                            the best sources but a very candid indication in each case of the degree
                            of validity. On many points certain to be discussed there are no
                            reliable data, though claims are often put forward by interested parties
                            as if complete accuracy of information existed. In <pb n="56"
                                xml:id="pg_56" facs="0126"/>these cases it will be as important to
                            be in a position to examine such claims critically as to make final
                            statements of fact. Where partisanship infects statistics as seriously
                            as it does in many parts of Europe and Asia, the essence of reliability
                            is to know as clearly as possible the character of the sources upon
                            which assertions of fact are based.</p>
                        <p>The second condition is complete mobility of the material. The data must
                            not only have been assembled before the conference. It must be
                            immediately available in the course of the conference.</p>
                        <p>The third condition is simplicity and lucidity of presentation. This
                            involves the preparation of maps, charts, graphs, statistical tables,
                            schematic outlines, upon which a high degree of ingenuity has been
                            exercised.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>The range of topics upon which the Inquiry may be required to furnish
                            information has expanded with the course of events. The most striking
                            case is supplied by the disintegration of the former Russian Empire.
                            Four months ago the plans of the Inquiry called for the study of Russia
                            as a unitary Great Power; today Russia is a complex of nationalistic,
                            economic, and religious questions stretching from the Baltic Sea through
                            Central Asia to China. Should Austria-Hungary disintegrate a multitude
                            of new issues and relationships would immediately be raised. Under these
                            conditions it has seemed prudent to maintain a flexible program, and to
                            lay plans for further research in anticipation of new developments.</p>
                        <p>The method of settlement laid down by the President in his addresses
                            introduces another factor which increases the detailed variety of the
                            topics likely to be discussed. Since the peace conference is to be
                            conducted by open discussion, a command of fact totally unnecessary in
                            secret negotiations is required. Where the whole world is to be the
                            critic of the debates, the American influence will be in proportion to
                            the depth and incisiveness with which just principles are applied to
                            particular cases.</p>
                        <p>So far as the territorial settlement goes, the following areas are
                            indicated as probable subjects of discussion: <list>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The decisive negotiating power will lie with the United States, Great
                            Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. The
                            influence of these powers will be increased or diminished insofar as
                            they carry with them the support of the Russian nations, the
                            Scandinavian countries, Holland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Spain, Brazil,
                            Argentine, and Chile, and in a lesser degree of the smaller belligerents
                            and neutrals.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand the needs and purposes which inspire the claims
                            put forth by the Powers, it is necessary to have an analysis of the
                            relationship of their political, social, and economic needs to their
                            resources and their present situation. It is important to know on whom
                            they are dependent for supplies and who is dependent upon them, what
                            investments, what cultural and religious affiliations, what political
                            ideas, make them friendly or antagonistic to policies of other Powers
                            and to proposals which may be brought forward in the interests of
                            international order.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the claims put forward by the conferees will be determined
                            by the views of the dominant parties at the time of the settlement as to
                            the general character of the settlement, as to immediate national
                            interest and need. These views will either be enlarged or diminished by
                            the process of negotiation, as viewed in its effect upon the support of
                            other powers, the adhesion of the second-class powers, and the interests
                            and demands of domestic factions.</p>
                        <p>As a general rule, it is necessary, therefore, to know, in regard to each
                            disputed area, what resources human and material it contains, what is
                            the concrete interest of each power in the area, what political group or
                            groups within each power are concerned in that interest. It is necessary
                            also to know the place of that area in the general plan of each power’s
                            foreign policy. Finally, the data as to each disputed area and as to the
                            nations with whom it has relationships must be in such form that the
                            displacement of forces effected by any particular proposal can be
                            estimated.</p>
                        <p>The American negotiators must be in a position to judge whether a claim
                            put forth by a power is supported by the democracy at home, or whether
                            it is merely a traditional diplomatic objective or the design of an
                            imperialistic group. In the fiercely disputed areas they must be
                            prepared freely to offer friendly suggestions either of compromise or of
                            constructive experiment, but if these suggestions are to have much
                            weight they must be supported by a body of reliable fact and must be
                            presented tersely and graphically so as to carry conviction.</p>
                        <p>In addition to territorial settlements the American program involves
                            complex covenants in respect to trade, future international disputes,
                                <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0128"/>the guarantees of minority
                            rights, of equality upon the seas, and of reduction of armaments. For a
                            successful negotiation in respect to each proposal, it will be necessary
                            not only to have the data that bears upon the probable effects of the
                            proposal, but also a large number of alternative suggestions, so as to
                            give an accommodating and experimental character to American
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the American negotiators should command various well tested
                            programs of reform and reconstruction for the historically embittered
                            areas. They should be in a position to propose to the torn peoples of
                            the Balkans and Turkey or to the natives of Africa expedients of
                            education, sanitation, financial reform, adequate police, and simply
                            administered justice. With this end in view, comparative studies are
                            being made of the different types of government applied to dependent and
                            backward peoples. A careful examination is planned of the various
                            attempts in the past to secure the rights of subject peoples. From
                            sympathetic analyses of failure and success it is hoped that a working
                            program may be derived.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">III. The Technique of the Inquiry</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1) The assembly of source materials. The inquiry is not purchasing a
                            library. It is locating source materials in the various libraries of the
                            country, keeping in its central office a card catalogue of the
                            materials, a critique of them, and the nearest places where the actual
                            material can be found. The librarian and his staff are instructed to
                            draw up a scheme by which a complete reference library could be
                            physically assembled in New York on two weeks notice. No actual
                            arrangements have been made with the various libraries of the country,
                            but it is assumed that whenever the time came all necessary books could
                            be borrowed or requisitioned.</p>
                        <p>There is now working in the service of the Inquiry a group of experts
                            each of whom commands the source material in some portion of the field.
                            These men can be assembled at any time, are organized in groups under
                            leaders, and are entirely competent to handle the source materials.</p>
                        <p>The Inquiry has prepared and keeps current, the declarations of
                            statesmen, of opposition parties and of important political groups in
                            all parts of the world, as they bear upon the settlement. These are
                            arranged so that the total official or semi-official expression of any
                            one nation in regard to the settlement can be studied, or the total
                            expressions of all nations in regard to a particular topic. There is
                            also being prepared a diplomatic history since 1870 arranged in special
                            form so that all the documents bearing upon a topic which has been a
                            continuing object of diplomatic interest are available.</p>
                        <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0129"/>
                        <p>2) The preparations outlined above have as their object the creation of
                            an agency by which research can be carried on from time to time in the
                            course of the negotiations. In addition data are now being collected by
                            specialists for those problems which the present situation justifies us
                            in believing will surely be the subject of discussion. For territorial
                            questions these data will be arranged as follows:</p>
                        <p>In each area the smallest administrative units for which figures exist
                            are listed on a chart and in parallel columns the latest and most
                            reliable data are assembled. If the data are of a kind about which there
                            is no dispute of authorities they will be designed in one fashion; if
                            there is dispute, as for example in Macedonia, the best figures (in this
                            case the best Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek, Austrian, German, French
                            and Russian statistics) will be given, together with the judgment of the
                            specialists in the employ of the Inquiry. It is planned to put upon
                            these charts not only statistics but brief historical and political
                            facts or comment of a significant character. Naturally, some districts
                            will require more intensive research than others. The amount of research
                            put upon each district depends upon its critical character, upon the
                            number of scholars whose services can be secured, upon the time
                            available, and upon judgment of the value of research.</p>
                        <p>Presenting all the available material in respect to an area in this
                            schematic form and in the smallest feasible units, the immediate bearing
                            of any frontier which can be assigned may be determined with some
                            definiteness. Moreover, a great many possible combinations of fact can
                            easily be made if the data are arranged in this way. Thus, for example,
                            if the Cholm question should arise at the conference, the procedure
                            would be to list the administrative districts in the area under dispute,
                            say ten or twelve, extract from the chart of Polish data the facts in
                            regard to these districts and sum them up in a table showing the ethnic
                            composition of the area, the religious affiliations, the condition of
                            agriculture, the industrial plants, the mineral production and mineral
                            possibilities, the educational facilities, the railroad systems and
                            canals which cross it, and any important historical facts connected with
                            the area. If the program is completed and if the proper clerical and
                            mechanical assistance is at hand, the Inquiry should be able to furnish
                            the American negotiators with the relevant facts for a problem of this
                            kind in two hours or less.</p>
                        <p>In each area it is necessary to have available, besides the facts as to
                            that area, the best possible analysis of the interests of the
                            neighboring states and of the Great Powers in any particular settlement.
                            With this object in view, there is now in course of preparation a
                            schematic and analytic study of the special interests, commercial,
                            political, religious, military, of each power. These interests are
                            sometimes expressed by treaties, sometimes by informal understanding,
                            sometimes <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0130"/>they exist merely as
                            ambitions among certain influential classes. Wherever possible, it is
                            important that the interests of each nation should be visualized as
                            concretely as possible and traced home to its course [<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>].</p>
                        <p>3) Presentation of material. There are being prepared for the Inquiry a
                            set of base maps for all the areas under discussion. Upon these base
                            maps will be laid a large amount of the data which seems relevant, and
                            copies of a complete loose-leaf atlas will be at the disposal of the
                            negotiators. In addition, the Inquiry is planning, by means of a
                            properly organized force actually at the conference, to be in a position
                            to lay any proposal made upon a map, showing the relations of that
                            proposal to any set of facts for which information is at hand. Thus, if
                            a certain boundary for Poland is proposed, the Inquiry would be prepared
                            to furnish the negotiators with maps showing the relation of the
                            proposal to the distribution of Poles or to the location of mineral
                            deposits, railways, etc. Besides maps, the Inquiry is planning charts
                            and graphs showing various relationships, as, for example, the
                            dependence of Austria upon the port of Trieste, or the relation of the
                            trade of an independent Poland to Germany and to Austria. Provided there
                            is a sufficient expert staff to control the underlying source material
                            adequately, and provided sufficient draftsmen and cartographers are
                            available, the Inquiry ought to be in a position to furnish the American
                            negotiators with graphic representations of sets of facts in their
                            relationships upon very short notice.</p>

                        <p>This is of primary importance, and should be examined from every angle,
                            because the full exercise of America’s influence can only be brought to
                            bear if a skilful use is made of the order of business.</p>

                            </hi>: I had hoped before this to be in New York and to get into more
                            direct and detailed touch with your work. That which I know of it and
                            have seen is so excellent that I probably could contribute little in the
                            way of suggestion. However there is one branch of study which intended
                            to mention as of importance in view of the uncertainty as to the scope
                            of the conference which will take up world affairs. I refer to South and
                            Central America. It is <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0147"/>of course
                            possible that these regions may not be considered at all, but I think as
                            a matter of precaution we should give as careful study to them as to the
                            countries of Europe and Asia, following the same general treatment along
                            historical, ethnological, geographical and economic lines. It would be
                            most unfortunate to be without preparation if these countries became
                            subjects of discussion.</p>
                        <p>I am writing you this because I do not see how I can get to New York
                            within the next few days, and I do not think work on these subjects
                            should be postponed. Possibly you have had this same thought and have
                            already acted upon it. If so, this letter is superfluous. But it seemed
                            to me sufficiently important and urgent to call to your attention on the
                            possibility that the desirability of this particular study and
                            collection of data had not occurred to you.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have your note of
                            April 17th with its valuable suggestion to the effect that there is
                            urgent need for as careful a study along historical, ethnological,
                            geographical, and economic lines of the problems involved in South and
                            Central America as for those involved in the countries of Europe, Asia,
                            and Africa.</p>
                        <p>We have had in mind the need of such additional studies, but in view of
                            the financial budget on which we are operating, we had planned to
                            postpone the South and Central American work until the European, Asian,
                            and African work, and general studies in international economics and
                            organization had progressed further; for on our present scale of
                            expenditure it is only possible to take up our work serially, as a
                            simultaneous investigation in all the fields would entail a larger
                            monthly expenditure than we are now incurring. A consideration of the
                            general scope of the work in brief outline will make the situation
                            clearer.</p>
                        <p>In order to be prepared for possible eventualities when the conference
                            assembles, facts bearing on the following problems should be gathered,
                            digested, and held under such control that they can be promptly and
                            compendiously presented: <list>

                        <p>1) and 2) above we have well in hand, though much remains to be done if
                            our representatives at the conference are to be supplied with data which
                            will enable them to maintain their positions as against those taken by
                            representatives of the Central Powers, or even of our Allies, who have
                            been in active and even bitter negotiation with one another on such
                            subjects for so many years, and whose officials, travelers, and scholars
                            have busied themselves with them and know the ins and outs of the
                            problems involved with an intimate knowledge. All that remains to be
                            done in 1) and 2), in addition to filling out in detail the data we have
                            blocked out in substantially satisfactory general outlines, is to
                            prepare maps and charts of the Atlantic Ocean basin, the Pacific Ocean
                            basin, and the Indian Ocean basin, as it is over these oceans that the
                            lines of communication run which tie together in relation to one another
                            the eastern and the western hemispheres, and Eurasia with the continent
                            of Africa. The omission just named we can supply before very long, and
                            without adding to the present monthly rate of expenditure.</p>
                        <p>While on this subject, I may point out a factor in the situation that it
                            is easy to overlook. If our government is to be prepared at the
                            conference it will be necessary not only to accumulate an appreciable
                            body of reports, maps, and graphic presentations of problems and
                            possible solutions, but, even more important, to train a body of workers
                            who can handle this mass of data and the research on which it is based,
                            and draw out from them, as the conference progresses, just the facts
                            that are needed to make clear the reach and significance of proposals
                            that will be constantly made, and the exact nature of which it is quite
                            impossible to anticipate. This means, of course, that even when the
                            facts with regard to any problem or area have been gathered with
                            approximate adequacy, the force must continue to deal with such data,
                            and, by constant practice, to perfect itself in analyzing proposals of
                            various kinds and presenting their significance in a compact and readily
                            intelligible form, for in no other form can busy officials and conferees
                            use them. This is the critical part of our task.</p>
                        <p>Coming specifically to the matter of expenditure, our last month’s budget
                            shows that we spent some $7,000 for the salaries of men engaged in
                            gathering historical, ethnographic, geographic, and economic data, and
                            in administration; $3,000 for the salaries of the clerical force <pb
                                n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0149"/>and for draftsmen to put the
                            results of research in compact form on maps and diagrams; and $3,000 in
                            addition for supplies and incidental expenses. The continuation of such
                            a monthly expenditure of $13,000 (which may run to $15,000 if rush
                            reports are called for) would enable us to complete the gathering of
                            data in the first and second fields above mentioned and, incidentally,
                            to give our force practice for the quick work we shall be called upon to
                            do at the conference itself. The cost of printing, a sizable item, is
                            not included in this estimate, nor is the cost of getting to and
                            attending the conference. Moreover, I am, of course, omitting any
                            estimate of the cost of gratuitous services and equipment, contributed
                            by universities, societies and libraries, that total much more than
                            $13,000 monthly.</p>
                        <p>And now as to South and Central America. We have made a careful study of
                            the additional expenditure which would be necessary if we are to take on
                            South and Central America at once, on top of what we are at present
                            swinging, with the following result: We can get South and Central
                            America up to the standard of adequacy we have attained in the European
                            regions by August first if an additional expenditure of $20,000, to be
                            scattered over the three months up to August first, is authorized, and
                            can keep this additional data alive and train a staff to deal with it
                            competently at the conference at a cost of about $5,000 a month from
                            August first until the time of starting for the conference. This
                            calculation is based on an estimate which shows that we will need for
                            each of the additional areas—that is, for South and for Central
                            America—about four draftsmen, one supervisor of draftsmen, a gatherer
                            and digester of economic data, with two assistants, a gatherer and
                            digester of political and social data, with two assistants, a man
                            competent to make diagrams and graphs, and some additional clerical
                            force, and expenditures for supplies and drafting expenses.</p>
                        <p>Of course I see the wisdom of your suggestion, and appreciate that in the
                            case of certain eventualities we might proceed to the conference
                            unprepared to deal at all adequately with problems in which Latin
                            America would be vitally involved, and in which her support and
                            co-operation would be of decided significance.</p>
                        <p>With cordial regards,</p>

                            was felt that it would be unwise to use the limited force available for

                            certain stage of progress. Moreover, it is believed that most valuable
                            assistance can be obtained from the men in government service who have
                            conducted actual negotiations with the neutrals.</p>

                        <p>These maps are needed in quantities for the convenient summary of the
                            research and for the exposition of problems susceptible to such
                            expression. In addition, it is proposed to put upon graphs all material

                        <p>In addition, it is proposed to provide, at a cost of $20 a set, 25 sets
                            of the millionth map of Europe and western Asia produced by the British
                            General Staff and the French Service Geographique de l’Armee. We have
                            the best of reasons for believing that the authoritative data for the
                            British and French governments will be embodied on these maps, and it is
                            therefore the intention of the Inquiry to put all data which might be
                            used as evidence at the conference upon millionth maps. This will make
                            them readily comparable with the British and French material.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">24) The collection of detailed primary reference
                            maps:</p>
                        <p>There will be required at the peace conference a very complete reference
                            library of detailed European maps, including all the General Staff maps
                            and other detailed maps engraved to a large scale. Most of these will be
                            loaned by the American Geographical Society. There are certain ones,
                            however, which will have to be purchased abroad, and for which provision
                            should be made soon. The approach of the peace conference itself will
                            create a great scarcity of maps.</p>
                        <p>The disposition to be made in the future of draftsmen now available is a
                            difficult question. A few of them will be transferred to work on Latin
                            America and their salaries debited to the Latin American fund. In one or
                            two cases, perhaps, different types of draftsmen will be needed as the
                            work advances, and some of the men should therefore be dispensed with.
                            As trained draftsmen are exceedingly scarce, and as a force of draftsmen
                            will be needed at the conference itself, the drafting force should in
                            principle be kept intact. The type of work needed by the Inquiry can
                            only be developed after months of training, even of the most skilled
                            draftsmen, and any man who has been with the Inquiry for some time
                            represents an invested capital of experience which should be
                            preserved.</p>
                        <p>However, should it appear by the autumn that the meeting of the
                            conference is likely to be postponed for a long time, a recommendation
                            for the decrease of the drafting force can be made.</p>

                            assembled on short notice.</p>
                        <p>The library is under the direction of Mr. <persName>Andrew
                                Keogh</persName>, librarian of Yale University, who has a staff of
                            seven. Mr. <persName>Keogh</persName>’s department has two functions: 1)
                            the preservation and indexing of all the documents and maps of the
                            Inquiry; 2) the preparation now of lists of books which will be needed
                            on all subjects likely to be discussed at the peace conference, together
                            with information as to where they can most quickly be borrowed or
                            purchased.</p>
                        <p>The Inquiry is not now purchasing a library. Only a very few
                            indispensable books which cannot be obtained in accessible libraries are
                            being bought. The library which will actually be used at the <pb n="96"
                                xml:id="pg_96" facs="0166"/>peace conference exists as a paper
                            scheme, planned on the theory that when actual negotiations begin the
                            necessary books can be obtained.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">26) The revision and current use of all material in the
                            archives:</p>
                        <p>This is under the immediate control of the Executive Committee, who have
                            a staff of four assistants, <persName>P. T. Moon</persName>,
                                <persName>H. L. Gray</persName>, <persName>F. E.
                            Flournoy</persName>, <persName>John Storck</persName>. These men are
                            trained every day in the use of the material itself. They have grown up
                            with the Inquiry and know all its details. They are the men who are
                            needed to control the intricate mass of material now in the archives. As
                            the material increases in scope, the importance of this part of the work
                            grows. On it depends, in the last analysis, the availability of all the
                            research being done. This staff should under any circumstance be kept
                            intact, and in the course of the next few months should be slightly
                            enlarged.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In Appendix 1<note n="17" xml:id="d44fn17">Not printed.</note> there is
                            given a list of all the workers for the Inquiry, defining them as paid
                            and unpaid. Among the paid recommendation is made as to those whose
                            services can profitably be terminated, and those whose services should
                            be continued. This list represents the minimum with which the work of
                            the Inquiry can successfully be carried on within the next 12 months.
                            Most of the men on the list will by that time have accumulated a fund of
                            experience which will make them indispensable for the final conference
                            itself, and provision should be made for keeping this force intact.
                            Should the end of the war be delayed after next spring, it will be
                            possible to reduce the staff very considerably by adopting the principle
                                <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0167"/>that certain of the men
                            should be regarded as on a reserve list, to be called into active
                            service whenever needed.</p>
                        <p>By working under full pressure it would be possible to produce an
                            intelligent result from six to twelve months hence. For the production
                            of a result which will adequately support the case of the President in
                            all its detailed application, the research should be regarded as
                            continuous up to and including the time of the conference itself.</p>
                        <p>Special emphasis is put upon the necessity of training each individual
                            man for this work. The type of intellectual effort required differs
                            radically from any with which university life accustoms one. The mass
                            and intricacy of the detail covered is greater than any ever attempted
                            in the field of political science.</p>
                        <p>The discovery and applications of methods by which this mass of detail
                            can be made readily and reliably useful to statesmen engaged in
                            momentous negotiations requires men who have lived with the research and
                            who know it in all its parts, and have explored all the means by which
                            it can be arranged and presented. The Inquiry should be regarded
                            primarily as an active organization, and not simply as a group of
                            scholars producing voluminous reports which can be printed and used in
                            their absence. For satisfactory results at the peace conference, a
                            selected group of men who have done the work should be on hand to
                            mediate between the documentary material and the peace commissioners
                            themselves.</p>

                            </hi>: I am very proud indeed of the copy of your book that you sent me.
                            I shall keep it in the very small box which contains things I shall want
                            always to preserve.</p>
                        <p>The work here goes along steadily and what might be called the structural
                            part of it is developing fairly satisfactorily. On many of the problems
                            of first-rate importance there is a real famine in men and we have been
                            compelled practically to train and create our own experts. This is
                            especially true of problems connected with Russia, the Balkans, Turkey
                            and Africa. Those are lands intellectually practically unexplored. What
                            we are on the lookout for is genius—sheer, startling genius and nothing
                            else will do because the real application of the President’s idea to
                            those countries requires inventiveness and resourcefulness which is
                            scarcer than anything. I have been reading lately with much perturbation
                            about the way in <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0168"/>which ignorance
                            on the part of peace commissioners in the past has lost causes which
                            have been won on the battlefield. It isn’t difficult to win a war and
                            lose the peace. England did it over and over again in the nineteenth
                            century in regard to Turkey.</p>

                            which is being carried out by the experts whom they have selected, and
                            of which I spoke to you yesterday. I think that except as to division IV
                            you cover practically everything that is in the list. However, you may
                            find this of considerable interest.</p>

                            is being done. The one thing we must guard against is pre-conceived
                            ideas or theories which will affect the unbiased treatment of the
                            various subjects. I am sure you realize the necessity of this, but it
                            ought to be impressed upon those who are working for you.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Thank you for the
                            French outline of preparatory work. I am having it compared with our own
                            and with similar British outlines which we have, in order to extract
                            from it such suggestions as it may offer.</p>
                        <p>We were very glad of the opportunity for a conference with you last
                            Thursday. It clarified our ideas in a number of important respects.</p>
                        <p>I am also glad to see that our insistence, on the prime necessity of
                            being open-minded and unbiased, accords with your ideas. We look upon
                            ourselves as engaged in forging instruments in aid of judgment; that is,
                            in gathering for each region and problem a thorough, well proportioned
                                <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0169"/>and well organized body of
                            facts which will aid you and other officers of the Government in
                            determining policies. Naturally, we have had difficulty from time to
                            time in keeping the theories of our collaborators out of the work, and
                            in some cases it has not been wholly possible to do so. Indeed, there
                            are regions, Austria-Hungary, for instance, and the Balkans, where it
                            sometimes seems best to get the facts from two or more antagonistic
                            points of view, as such points of view will be urged at the Conference,
                            and it is well to know what they are. But that, of course, is different
                            from admitting our own prepossessions into the study of regions and
                            problems.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On February 11th last the undersigned
                            were orally directed by you to undertake certain work in the field of
                            international law relating to such questions as might be considered by
                            the Peace Conference at the close of the present war, including,
                            pursuant to your subsequent direction, consideration of questions of
                            international policy in connection therewith, with special reference to
                            the historic attitude of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to such instructions the undersigned have the honor to report as
                            to the scope and progress of such work as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">I.—A Library, Including as Far as Can Be Foreseen,

                        </p>
                        <p>There are two phases of this portion of the work. The first phase is the
                            preparation of an inclusive list of such works, which comprise, <pb
                                n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0170"/>chiefly speaking, collections
                            of treaties, international agreements of a less formal character,
                            diplomatic documents, state papers, statutes, judicial decisions, the
                            works of prominent publicists, and of certain historians.</p>
                        <p>This collection necessarily includes Continental, Latin-American and
                            Japanese writings as well as those of Great Britain and the United
                            States, and also the leading periodicals during say the last twenty
                            years, as these contain many studies of importance which are more
                            detailed in their nature than those of the general works of authors of
                            authority or repute.</p>
                        <p>The second phase of this portion of the work comprises the actual
                            assembling of the library, partly, but to a limited extent, by purchase.
                            This limitation is necessary not only for financial reasons, but also
                            because of the fact that a large portion of the necessary collection is
                            not available except in existing libraries. Arrangements are to be made
                            with the chief libraries of the country for the loan of such books and
                            documents as are not purchase[d], in order that they can be assembled in
                            advance upon very short notice.</p>

                        <p>For this purpose the field of international law has been divided into
                            somewhat more than forty headings and under these headings are being
                            assembled the important treaties, agreements, diplomatic documents,
                            state papers, statutes, decisions, opinions, etc., having a bearing upon
                            the particular topic in question. Each collection is to be arranged and
                            edited with such brief comment as may be deemed necessary and will
                            contain a bibliography. Such of the matter as may be in foreign
                            languages is to be translated and the collection under each topic
                            separately printed in convenient form by the Government Printing
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>An essential part of this work in each case includes extracts from the
                            periodicals mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, research in this division is limited to the century
                            commencing with the Congress of Vienna and ending with the outbreak of
                            the war.</p>

                        <p>While in general, monographic treatment is not deemed by the undersigned
                            appropriate for all topics, there are certain topics, particularly those
                            of a highly technical nature, in respect of which monographs
                            supplementing the collection of authorities are deemed necessary. In
                            some cases it is possible for this work to proceed in connection with
                            the assemblage of other material, described under II. In others it needs
                            to be postponed until the more essential work is completed.</p>
                        <p>This method of treatment is also deemed appropriate in regard to certain
                            legal questions arising from the war but requiring detailed settlement
                            thereafter, whatever may be the provisions of the Peace Treaty. Such,
                            for instance, are questions involved in the repatriation of
                            prisoners-of-war and the adjustment of property rights sequestrated
                            during the war.</p>

                            organization but wholly inappropriate to a large one now establishing
                            broad relationships with almost every scientific bureau of the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The time has come when there should be a stricter division of functions
                            among the officers of the Inquiry and an exact definition of status and
                            appointments. It is a source of growing embarrassment to remain as we

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel
                                    House</persName>
                            </hi>: The shortest way in which I can report on the work of the Inquiry
                            is to enclose the minutes of the first two meetings of the Research
                            Committee and the Map Committee.<note n="21" xml:id="d53fn21">Not
                                printed.</note> While some of the items are not self-explanatory the
                            general nature of the work will be sufficiently clear. We are going full
                            speed ahead and everyone is working in the highest spirit. The
                            composition and work of the Research Committee have reestablished the
                            morale of the whole staff.</p>
                        <p>I was unwilling to accept the responsibility for “men, money and plans”
                            except on condition that this responsibility be fully shared by members
                            of a research committee. In selecting the committee I was guided by the
                            thought that it must command the respect of everyone both within and
                            without the Inquiry. When the peace conference organization stands in
                            the limelight, as it inevitably will, I felt sure you would wish to have
                            the guiding committee composed of men of whom there can be not the
                            slightest question.</p>
                        <p>Permit me to say that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MSE1">Mezes</persName>
                            and I have worked together with cordial good-feeling and without the
                            slightest personal difficulty. But I could not escape the conviction
                            that his good nature had been taken advantage of for purposes that were
                            not in harmony with the spirit of joint responsibility and team work
                            that must pervade the Inquiry if its work is to be successful. Under
                            these circumstances there were only two ways out: to resign or to fight,
                            but not to quarrel. I could not, in view of the great importance of the
                            Inquiry, just drop out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDH1"
                                >Miller</persName> is an exceptionally wise and big man for whom we
                            all have the highest respect and it is to his judgment and tact that we
                            owe the success of the reorganization plans.</p>
                        <p>We now have matured plans and cooperative decisions and these are forged
                            without fuss or talk. We have in Dean <persName corresp="#p_HCH1"
                                >Haskins</persName> an extraordinary man—clear-headed, direct,
                            strong. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YAA1">Young</persName> is one of the
                            ablest men I have ever known and as Secretary of the Research Committee
                            brings a driving energy to the management of the research. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJT1">Shotwell</persName> is a brilliant scholar whose
                            wide experience and knowledge make him an indispensable critic of
                            research plans and results. You may depend upon us all for complete
                            devotion to the work and everyone on the team has that sense of personal
                            responsibility which is a guarantee of success.</p>
                        <p>The Committee has scrutinized the budget with extreme care. Certain
                            topics and areas are not yet represented. The best men we can <pb
                                n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0176"/>find ought to be engaged to
                            fill the gaps. For example, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YAA1"
                                >Young</persName>’s work on International Economics needs several
                            men at once. The savings we can effect will do something in supplying
                            the need for money. The Committee will challenge every expenditure. But
                            I am frank to say that the work actually suffers for need of funds. The
                            colleges and universities are carrying so heavy a burden that the
                            Inquiry is obliged to pay more and more for its men. We feel the most
                            urgent need for $5000 more per month. Given that, we could develop the
                            work with stronger men and at greater speed.</p>
                        <p>There comes to us all, who are working close to the problems, a sense of
                            the profound need for the work of the best men and for haste in order
                            that this country may take a fit place at the settlement.<note n="22"

                            </hi>: You may have seen in the newspapers some mention of the fact that
                            the Government of the United States has undertaken, under the general
                            direction of <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName>, a
                            systematic collection of information for the use of the American
                            delegates at the Peace Conference. Having recently been made chairman of
                            the Research Committee which has charge of the collection of a large
                            section of this material, I am desirous of having our equipment
                            strengthened on the side of Italy. Elaborate special studies are in
                            preparation on the linguistic and other questions connected with the
                            Italian-Austrian frontier, and Italian interests will also come in for
                            consideration in connection with the special studies on Africa and the
                            Eastern Mediterranean. It would, however, be of advantage if we could
                            have at our disposal a rather full statement of the general questions
                            which will concern Italy at the Peace Conference, the statement to be
                            prepared by one who is fully informed of existing conditions and at the
                            same time able to regard them objectively. You are obviously indicated
                            as the only person qualified to prepare a statement of this kind, and we
                            should be very grateful if you would undertake it. It could be made as
                            full as you choose, taking up the matter under various headings in the
                            form of an analysis of the situation and the pros and cons of the
                            different problems, whether political, economic, or military, which will

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Before <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName> left I had a conference
                            with him regarding future work in the Latin American field. After going
                            into the matter with some care we reached the conclusion that all the
                            work that need be done in preparation for the peace conference in that
                            field could be well taken care of on the balance of the fund originally
                            allotted to it—about $6000—and he asked me to arrange for the tying up
                            of this work on that basis.</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0179"/>
                        <p>We also have before us a program of work in Latin America prepared by
                            Professor <persName>Bailey Willis</persName>, who has been in charge of
                            that field for us. <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName>
                            thought that the work proposed by Professor <persName>Willis</persName>
                            would bring in valuable results, and the rest of us here at the Inquiry
                            are of the same opinion, but it seemed to him that the results would
                            hardly bear on the peace conference and should be judged on the basis of
                            their possible utility to the Department of State rather than on the
                            basis of the needs of the Inquiry or the peace conference. He therefore
                            asked me to so advise Professor <persName>Willis</persName>, in order
                            that the Professor might take up with your Department the question as to
                            whether such work should be undertaken under its auspices.</p>
                        <p>I have so advised Professor <persName>Willis</persName>, from whom you
                            will no doubt hear shortly, and I am sending a copy of this letter to

                            arrival on the other side is noted in the press.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving he decided on a chart of organization of the Inquiry, a
                            copy of which I am enclosing;<note n="26" xml:id="d58fn26">Not enclosed
                                with file copy of this letter; it was apparently similar to the
                                chart enclosed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MSE1"
                                >Mezes</persName>’ letter of Oct. 25, 1918, to Secretary <persName

                                    112</ref>.</note> division heads remain unchanged. His idea was
                            to organize the force of the Inquiry in the way in which it could most
                            effectively work when the conference is in session and he thought it
                            would be well for the organization to go into effect at once in order
                            that we might practice our parts ahead of time.</p>
                        <p>He believed that the administrative plan with heads rather than with
                            committees would prove more effective, though no doubt special
                            committees for consultation and editorial revision or vise will be <pb
                                n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0180"/>constituted from time to time
                            as the exigencies of situations may require.</p>
                        <p>He especially charged me with the pleasant duty of thanking the members
                            of the Research Committee for their invaluable aid in rendering the work
                            of the last few months effective.</p>
                        <p>This is just an outline of his message which I shall be glad to expand
                            into fuller detail should any points remain unclear.</p>

                            </hi>: I have your letter of 19 October and note the changes in the
                            organization of the Inquiry which you enclose therewith. It is quite
                            clear that there is no place for committees in the kind of plan you
                            outline. I am glad to learn that <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel
                                House</persName> thought the work of the Research Committee during
                            the summer had some value.</p>
                        <p>In the copy of the chart sent me, the various fields of investigation are
                            left swinging in the air without any connection with the officers above.
                            It would look, however, as if the problem areas are supposed to be under
                            the immediate direction of Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bowman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YAA1">Young</persName>,
                            and, unless otherwise instructed, I shall assume that as division chief
                            I report to them.</p>
                        <p>I also note the omission of Luxemburg from the problem areas, where it
                            belongs along with Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Before <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName> left for Europe we
                            discussed together the work already accomplished and the year’s program
                            for Latin America with which you are familiar.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName> asked me to say to
                            you that the work already done for Latin America, and such further work
                            as could be done on the balance of the $20,000 fund (which amounts to
                            about $6000), would <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0181"/>bring in
                            the minimum of essential material for the peace conference, and that the
                            proposed year’s program went into many matters which in his judgment
                            were valuable, and might well be called to your attention as possibly
                            useful to your Department, but as going beyond the needs of the Inquiry
                            or the peace conference.</p>
                        <p>He thought, however, that a part of the program involving an expenditure
                            of $5000 or less monthly from November 1st, and for a period of two or
                            three months, would bring in all the material contemplated in the
                            original program submitted to you on May 4th;<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d60fn27">Not printed.</note> and supplement the minimum
                            results mentioned above, and would undoubtedly be useful at the peace
                            conference if certain questions regarding Latin America should come up,
                            as they may.</p>
                        <p>If you think well of such an additional two or three months’ program, we

                                >Colonel House</persName>’s statement to me that he thought that
                            some seventy-five or eighty individuals should compose the force of the
                            Inquiry, an estimate he said he had reached after discussing the matter
                            with you.</p>
                        <p>His further thought was that while some of this force might not be needed
                            at once, probably most of it would be in view of two facts: first, that
                            it would have to be kept in operation or else be lost and could probably
                            be kept in operation best as a unified body; and second, that there was
                            no way at present of determining the order in which the different
                            members of the force would be needed and that they could be used, if
                            kept as one body, to get the material into more satisfactory shape than
                            it is at present.</p>

                            programme, and I would be obliged if you would have a simpler one worked

                            issue will be settled at the peace conference and practically so certain
                            that all detailed discussions of financial and commercial and other
                            similar arrangements will be delegated by the conference to special
                            conferences or commissions, that I think he ought to plan only to carry
                            the men and materials with him which will be serviceable in settling the
                            main questions, together of course with the necessary clerical aid.</p>

                            consideration. This morning he returned the diagram to me with a letter

                            coming up on the train yesterday to study the program we discussed in
                            your office.<note n="34" xml:id="d69fn34">See the undated memorandum by
                                the Secretary of State, <ref target="#pg_113">p. 113</ref>.</note>
                            It seems to me that it meets emergency needs quite thoroughly, but I
                            find that in the section to be under my charge there is one omission
                            that I hope can be supplied.</p>
                        <p>There is no place for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bowman</persName>,
                            who as you know has acted and is still acting as our Executive Officer,
                            and who therefore does not come in under divisional specialists,
                            cartographers, or the library force. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bowman</persName> in addition to his valuable services to us is
                            Director of the American Geographical Society, which has furnished us
                            with our headquarters free of charge for the last year and has extended
                            to us many courtesies. I should not feel that I could ask him to go or
                            ask his trustees to approve of his going under the title of Confidential
                            Clerk, and I am writing to ask if in lieu of that position there might
                            not be substituted the position of Chief Territorial Specialist or that
                            of Executive Officer, which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bowman</persName> now occupies. If his services should not be
                            available our work would be very seriously embarrassed.</p>

                            will inform you.</p>

                        <p>I need hardly say that some of the most important data affecting boundary
                            decisions are economic, involving a knowledge of the precise location,
                            of the value and of the amount of mineral and agricultural resources, of
                            the drainage lines by rail and water effecting the distribution of such
                            resources, etc. Such economic problems are thick along the northern,
                            eastern and western limits of Bohemia and Silesia, in Galicia and, of
                            course, in Asiatic Turkey at various places. It was with this in mind
                            that I suggested Professor <persName corresp="#p_YAA1">Young</persName>,
                            who is primarily an economist, and I suggested him for Turkey in view of
                            the large part that economic problems play there. But on reflection, I
                            am sure it would be clearer and better to let <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAA1">Young</persName> go under his own colors rather
                            than as a regional specialist for Turkey, and he is a man of too much
                            competence and position to be asked to go merely as an assistant. The
                            change suggested will not, of course, add to the number originally
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>I note what you say about stenographers and translators and about the

                        <p>3. Things are moving so rapidly that the question of a place for the
                            Peace Conference is upon us. The French are urging Paris. The Belgians,
                            Brussels. The only objection to Paris is that if a sharp difference
                            should arise between one of the Allies and the French it might be
                            embarrassing. Otherwise it is desirable. Will you not advise me as to
                            your preference.</p>
                        <p>The Supreme War Council will not meet until Wednesday.</p>

                            wiser care being taken not to choose a place where either German or

                            portion can be released, if desirable, before the conference.</p>

                                involve the leasing by the United States of such telegraph and
                                telephone lines as may be necessary and available and within the

                        <p>11. On second thought it occurs to me that Versailles may be the best
                            place for the peace conference where friendly influences and authorities
                            are in control rather than Switzerland which is saturated with every
                            poisonous element and open to every hostile influence in Europe.<note

                        <p>93. Though the decision to hold the Peace Conference in Paris has not as
                            yet been formally taken by the Allies and the United States I feel sure
                            that this will be done within next few days. The British Government has
                            sent representatives to Paris who have conferred with me and who have
                            advised me that they are planning to request the French Government to
                            requisition for the use of the British representatives at the Peace
                            Conference the Hotel Majestic or the Hotel Astoria and perhaps both. I
                            would very much prefer that all of the negotiations for the acquisition
                            of headquarters for the American representatives should be conducted by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Sharp</persName> with the
                            assistance of the American military authorities now in Paris who have
                            already had experience in dealing with the French authorities in the
                            matter of requisitioning accommodations for the use of the War
                            Department in Paris. Various plans for the accommodation of the American
                            representatives have been proposed to me and at the present time I am
                            inclined to think that the best suggestion that has been made is for you
                            through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Sharp</persName> to
                            request the French authorities to requisition for the use of the
                            American representatives at the Peace Conference the Hotel de Crillon,
                            together with a very much smaller hotel on the Boissy d’Anglas in the
                            near vicinity of the Crillon.</p>
                        <p>The Crillon has accommodations for approximately 100 guests. I should
                            estimate that the American representation including high military
                            officials would amount to at least this number. The operation of the
                            hotel should be placed entirely in the hands of citizens of the United
                            States. This can easily be arranged. The smaller hotel near the Crillon
                            could be fitted up as offices. It [<hi rend="italic">I?</hi>] would also
                            suggest that you instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWG1"
                                >Sharp</persName> to discuss with the French Government the
                            acquisition of suitable accommodations for the President. I have [in]
                            mind certain residences which may be suitable in the near vicinity of
                            the Crillon.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that the staff of the “Inquiry” be instructed to report at once
                            when it would be practical for them to sail for France. At the present
                            time it seems clear to me that we should try to establish our
                            organization in working order in Paris as near to December 1st as
                            possible though in all probability the actual Peace Conference will not
                            be called before December 16th because it is unnecessary and I believe
                            inadvisable to send to Europe for the Conference either stenographers,
                            code clerks, or any other kind of clerical assistance. Very efficient
                            men can be obtained to do this work for [<hi rend="italic">from?</hi>]
                            the army and naval forces now in Europe. I should appreciate an <pb

                            Commissioners at the peace conference the Hotel de Crillon. Possibly it
                            could be arranged so that the offices would be in that Hotel and any

                            this matter with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Sharp</persName>
                            as soon as possible in accordance with your suggestions, notifying him
                            that I will instruct him to take the matter up with the French

                            the conference in Paris? He might informally approach the French
                            Government on the subject without awaiting instructions. Please explain
                            to him also that I am taking this indirect means of communication as I
                            do not feel I can make it official in nature until the place of meeting

                        <p>It does not seem to me advisable that the Bureau of Inquiry should leave
                            before the rest of the force as they will not be fully equipped with
                            stenographers and others. The President feels that we must economize in
                            the matter of clerical force and expects to draw largely from the army
                            supply in Paris.</p>

                        <p>130. For the President and Secretary of State. <persName>Lord
                                Derby</persName> has just sent word to me that he has heard from Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> that the British
                            Government does not feel that it is bound to consider Versailles as the
                            place finally decided upon for the Peace Conference. They feel that this
                            is a question which must be finally decided by the Inter-Allied
                            Conference. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> points
                            out, however, that after the various delegations have arrived in Paris,
                            and the organizations set up there, it will be most difficult to change
                            the meeting place of the final conference. <persName>Lord
                                Derby</persName> believes that the British Government has, however,
                            definitely accepted the proposal that the Inter-Allied Conference should
                            be held in Paris. <persName>Lord Derby</persName> states that he is
                            doing his best to hurry the French Government into the taking over of
                            the necessary accommodations for the staff of the British Government.
                                <persName>Lord Derby</persName> has asked the French Government to
                            take over both the Astoria which has 130 bedrooms and the Majestic Hotel
                            which has 450 bedrooms. He says that the rent has not yet been agreed
                            upon.</p>

                        <p>5968. Referring to the Department’s 34, November 13, 1 p.m. for <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName>. I would say that I have
                            been successful in getting prompt action by the French Government in the
                            matter of requisitioning the Hotel Crillon for [special?] use of the
                            American commissioners at the Peace Conference. Representations were
                            made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AG1">Auchincloss</persName> to me that
                            there was the greatest need for expedition in securing this property as
                            certain arrangements affecting the hotel accommodations would
                            necessarily have to be made prior to the actual coming over of the
                            members of the commission. A representative of the American military
                            governor of Paris called on me to inform me that the property would be
                            turned over to those representing the commission on the 25th instant;
                            just now, however, I am informed that the hotel will be formally
                            requisitioned on the 23rd instant and representative of the Embassy is
                            asked to be present. As to the terms of rental, duration of lease, etc.,
                            I asked Major Warburton, military attaché, to take up with the proper
                            authorities the question of procedure in taking over the property and
                            the estimate of the amount of rent, etc.; after seeing these authorities
                            he has left a report with me, the substance of which is as follows:
                            After the military governor of Paris has been notified that the property
                            is desired for military purposes, it is thereupon requisitioned on the
                            basis of the taxes paid upon the income derived from the property. A
                            Military Board of Reviews examines the property and if there are any
                            damages assesses value for same. The property is requisitioned by this
                            board for only the time that it is actually needed and may be returned
                            to the owners without any notice whatever. The rental assessed by the
                            board is arbitrary and in the case of the United States Government it
                            would be the same as that which the French or any other Government would
                            have to pay. I shall appreciate any further instructions that the
                            Department may desire to give in reference to the matter.</p>

                        <p>200. <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName> advises me as follows
                            with reference to tentative arrangements for leasing office space for
                            the peace commission in addition to the Hotel Crillon already taken over
                            by the Embassy. The transfer of the lease for the property at 4 Place de
                            la Concorde from the American Red Cross to the commission has been
                            arranged and is now awaiting signature. The rent of the property is now
                            75,000 francs a year, the lease to run for a period of 6 months after
                            the date announced by the French Government as the official [date?] of
                            the suspension of hostilities. Mr. <persName>Warren</persName> of the
                            legal department of the commission has examined the terms and approves.
                            There would, furthermore, be a charge of 40,000 francs representing less
                            than 50 percent of the cost of the fixtures installed by the Red Cross
                            which would thus be taken over by the commission and sold at the
                            expiration of its occupancy. Tentative arrangements have also been made
                            to take over four upper stories of adjoining building at 3 Rue Royale
                            for 3 months beginning December 7th, when the lease of Red Cross expires
                            at the rate of 2,000 francs a month. This lease may afterwards be
                            extended. Mr. <persName>Warren</persName> has examined and approves.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that matter be handled in the same way as in the case of Hotel
                            Crillon by direct authorization from the Secretary of State to the
                            Ambassador to sign these leases.</p>

                            Austria-Hungary which can enter into binding agreements? I feel obliged
                            not to leave before delivering my annual message to the Congress on the
                            second of December. I could leave immediately after that and hope that
                            it will be possible to fix the date of meeting accordingly. Would a
                            preliminary visit to England be wise if I could not visit Italy also

                            England. You could arrange to visit Italy later and during some <pb

                            sailing December 3d. This would enable you to land December 11th and
                            remain in England the 12th and 13th reaching Paris night of 14th. The
                            Peace Conference will probably be called for December 16th but there
                            need be no active sessions for a week or 10 days. This time could be
                            used for Inter-Allied conferences. Please let me know whether I can plan
                            according to this schedule.</p>

                            Ambassador, called today and presented me the following telegram from

                                <p>“If you think invitation would be acceptable will you please
                                    express to the President the sincere hope of His Majesty’s
                                    Government that should he decide to come to Europe in connection
                                    with negotiations for peace he will honor this country by
                                    landing here. I need hardly assure you of the warm welcome he
                                    will receive. Oxford University would, I know, be proud to offer
                                    him a degree. Cambridge has already done so, gladly violating in
                                    his honor its immemorial practice. I hope he [will] find time to
                                    visit both.”</p>

                                naturally changes some of our plans in preparing for the Conference.
                                It seems to me that we cannot begin the work before the President
                                arrives. We ought to be unanimous in this respect. Besides, I think
                                it is not a bad idea to let the German revolution settle down for a
                                while in order that we may know before proceeding what we have
                                before us. I would suggest to you that we draw up some preparatory
                                memoranda, either in London or in Paris. I am ready to accept all
                                your suggestions in this respect. If we should proceed thus, the
                                President on arriving could make his observations without any delay
                                and the task would find itself advanced. I expect to see Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> this afternoon. I
                                do not doubt that he will assent. A particularly serious question is
                                to know whether the President intends to take part in the
                                Conference. I ought not to hide from you that in my opinion this
                                seems to be neither desirable nor possible. Since he is chief of
                                state he is consequently not on the same level as ourselves. To
                                admit one chief of state without admitting all seems to me an
                                impossibility.”</p>

                            up in your career. The following are some of the points urged most
                            strongly by those who believe that it would be a mistake for you to
                            attend the Peace Conference, namely: <list>

                                    a citadel of power beyond that of all nations, and that your
                                    association at the peace table with well-understood statesmen,
                                    who are but frail men long subject to criticism and even
                                    suspicion by certain classes of peoples, would lower your
                                    dignity, mar your prestige, and entourage resistance to any
                                    ultimatum that you might find it necessary to submit to the

                                <item>That it would be unnecessary for you to wear away the strength
                                    of your armor and of your sword upon lesser questions and in
                                    minor debates; that these simpler but more tedious questions and
                                    other preliminaries could be disposed of by the Peace Conference
                                    before the great questions which will start the contest of great
                                    nations come before the Peace Conference. And that even then you
                                    need not attend the conference until it has reached such a stage
                                    of open and hopeless rupture that your dominating presence,
                                    personality and power are required to force the cessation of
                                    debate and the adoption of the only program that this country
                                    will ever stand for.</item>

                                <item>That it is unnecessary at this time to either declare that you
                                    will or will not attend the conference, as nothing but events
                                    can determine the necessity of the case.</item>

                                <item>That if the adoption of your program should ultimately require
                                    your presence at the peace table then all other considerations,
                                    both personal and political, should be cast aside.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>You know, of course, that the latter expressions were mine as well as the
                            expressions of a number of other supporters of yours who attended the
                            dinner. I must say, however, that I have the very highest regard for the
                            opinions of those who expressed contrary views. I have again this
                            morning, when visiting several of the Departments, listened to similar
                            arguments both pro and contra. Should you desire at any time to speak to
                            any of these gentlemen with regard to the matter, I will, of course,
                            feel at perfect liberty to submit to you their names.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I hope that if you do go to the Peace Conference you will not
                            come back until your program is adopted. Then I know that you will come
                            back with the recognition that you have won and are entitled to, a
                            recognition that will not only reflect glory upon you but upon your
                            party which hangs and depends upon you.</p>

                            and English leaders desire to exclude me from the Conference for fear I
                            might there lead the weaker nations against them. If I were to come to
                            the seat of the Conference and remain outside I would be merely the
                            centre of a sort of sublimated lobby. All weak parties <pb n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135" facs="0205"/>would resort to me and there would be
                            exactly the same jealousy that was excited by the Germans addressing
                            themselves exclusively to me. I play the same part in our government
                            that the prime ministers play in theirs. The fact that I am head of the
                            state is of no practical consequence. No point of dignity must prevent
                            our obtaining the results we have set our hearts upon and must have. It
                            is universally expected and generally desired here that I should attend
                            the conference, but I believe that no one would wish me to sit by and
                            try to steer from the outside. I am thrown into complete confusion by
                            the change of programme. The programme proposed for me by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName>, <persName

                                >Reading</persName>, and the rest seems to me a way of pocketing me.
                            I hope you will be very shy of their advice and give me your own
                            independent judgment after reconsideration.</p>

                            </note> my judgment is that you should sail for France December 3d and
                            determine upon your arrival what share it is wise for you to take in the
                            proceedings. As Commander in Chief of the armed forces you have ample
                            grounds for coining in order to solve the important questions connected
                            with their return home. This can only be done here intelligently.</p>
                        <p>When here you will be in a position to assess the situation properly. It
                            is impossible to do so from Washington through cables from me.</p>
                        <p>As far as I can see all the Powers are trying to work with us rather than
                            with one another. Their disagreements are sharp and constant.</p>
                        <p>There is a tendency to delay not only the preliminary conferences but the
                            final one. This I think is unfortunate. The sooner you announce your
                            purpose of sailing December 3d the better. Until then no plans can be
                            made.</p>

                        <p>16. To be more explicit as to my own opinion as to the advisability of
                            your sitting in the Peace Conference let me say that I have constantly
                                <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0206"/>contended that you should
                            do so, but <persName corresp="#p_SWG1">Sharp</persName> is practically
                            the only one who has agreed with me. I see no need of reaching a

                        <p>16. I am issuing the following announcement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>[“]The President expects to sail for France immediately after the
                                    opening of the regular session of the Congress, for the purpose
                                    of taking part in the discussion and settlement of the main
                                    features of the treaty of peace. It is not likely that it will
                                    be possible for him to remain throughout the sessions of the
                                    formal peace conference, but his presence at the outset is
                                    necessary in order to obviate the manifest disadvantages of
                                    discussion by cable in determining the greater outlines of the
                                    final treaty, about which he must necessarily be consulted. He
                                    will, of course, be accompanied by delegates who will sit as the
                                    representatives of the United States throughout the conference.
                                    The names of the delegates will be presently announced.”</p>

                        <p>It would not be wise for me to come as if on another errand. There is

                            is uneasy about the presidency of the conference I will be glad to
                            propose that he preside. I urge that the larger delegations be limited
                            to five. Two other messages go to you through the State Department. I
                            approve of your plan to employ experts on the assessment of damage

                        <p>2380. The press states that the President and the Secretary of State are
                            on their way to Paris. Learn also from members of Ministry here that
                            they are informed from Paris that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                >Wilson</persName> is coming to Europe. If he comes, he will be

                            understand many problems.</p>
                        <p>His failure to visit Italy would have unfortunate and possibly serious
                            effect upon our relations and would greatly increase existing tension

                            <persName corresp="#p_AG1">Auchincloss</persName> visited today the
                            house placed at the President’s disposal by the French Government. This
                            house is number 28 Rue de Monceau, a couple of blocks above the
                            Boulevard Hausmann and in one of the highest parts of the city. The
                            house, however, is not far from the street, in the center of spacious
                            grounds, which are surrounded by a high wall. The interior of the house
                            is beautifully furnished and is in first-class repair. On the ground
                            floor there are the following rooms: A. Large dining room capable of
                            seating 35 persons; B, large ballroom or salon; C, three medium-sized
                            drawing rooms. On the second floor there are the following rooms: A,
                            small suite of two rooms; B, small study or library; C, large study or
                            writing-room, which could be used as the President’s workroom; D,
                            bedroom and drawing room and bath which could be used by the President;
                            E, connecting suite of three rooms, bedroom, boudoir and sitting room
                            which could be used by Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                            >Wilson</persName>; F, medium-size breakfast or dining room. On the
                            third floor there are seven bedrooms and four sitting rooms, all of
                            which are attractively furnished. There is a private garage on the
                            grounds. I am taking steps to have proper telephonic and wire
                            connections installed in a manner, as near as possible, similar to that
                            at present existing in the White House. All in all I believe the house
                            placed at the President’s disposal by the French Government is as
                            attractive a residence as there is in Paris, and I have informally
                            advised the Foreign Office that I felt sure the President would be
                            altogether pleased with the arrangements made in his behalf. If there
                            are any particular points that you wish me to attend to with respect to
                            these accommodations, I trust that you will communicate them to me in
                            the near future. The Foreign Office have asked me not to make public the
                            arrangements they are making for the present.</p>

                            regard to passports for persons connected with the President’s party,
                            who are going to France with him. He enquired about obtaining a passport
                            for the President. I told him that I did not think that it would be
                            necessary for the President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                >Wilson</persName> to carry passports. However, he seemed to think
                            that they would wish to have them. I told him then to put it up to the
                            President. The President said that he and Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName> wanted to take passports, and
                            upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName>’s request I went
                            to the White House this morning and took their applications. I told Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName> that I did not think
                            it necessary for the President to make the usual application, but he
                            said that the President wished to go through the usual routine. As soon
                            as the photographs are obtained, I shall have the passport made out and
                            send it to the Secretary for signature.</p>
                        <p>Please let me know whether the Secretary wishes me to come over and take

                        <p>184. Secret for the President. I have talked the matter over with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAWS1">Admiral Benson</persName> and I suggest
                            that you take the southern route and land at Marseille. At this time of
                            year the chances are very much in favor of your having far milder and
                            more pleasant weather on the southern route than on the northern one.
                            That was our experience last year. <persName corresp="#p_BAWS1"
                                >Benson</persName> tells me that it will only take 2 days longer and
                            that if you sail on the 4th you would arrive at Marseille on the 14th.
                            This would bring you to Paris in plenty of time for the Conference. Will
                            not you please let me know what you decide [to] do.</p>

                        <p>2423. Congressman Carlin of Virginia having been accorded private
                            audience today by the <persName>Pope</persName>, states that the latter
                            expressed <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0213"/>most earnestly his
                            hope that the President will visit Rome during his visit to Europe,
                            declaring that should he come here he would receive most cordial welcome
                            from himself and would be received by him formally or informally in
                            accordance with whatever President’s wishes might be. And further, that
                            President would find no embarrassment there touching anything President
                            might wish in visiting others or carrying out any program he might
                            have.</p>
                        <p>This statement accords with what the head of the American Catholic
                            College had already mentioned to me privately, to the effect that
                            nothing like any conditions such as were proposed when Mr.
                                <persName>Roosevelt</persName> came to Rome would be suggested
                            now.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing, taken in connection with the declaration to me by Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_OVE1">Orlando</persName> that the Italian
                            Government will make no difficulties [apparent omission] the President’s
                            visiting the <persName>Pope</persName>, I understand to mean that the

                        <p>19. For the President. According to present plans I understand that you
                            will arrive in Paris at 10 a.m. on Saturday December 14. Upon your
                            arrival you will be taken at once to your residence. At 12:30 a large
                            formal lunch will be given in your honor at the Elysees Palace by the
                            President. A committee of laboring men and socialists headed by
                                <persName>Albert Thomas</persName>, <persName>Renaud</persName>,
                                <persName>Geer</persName>, and <persName>Cabrain</persName>, wishes
                            to present you with an address at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday the 14th and to
                            hold a monster parade in your favor at that time. This is not definite
                            but will probably take place. On Monday December 16, a formal reception
                            will be tended you and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>
                            by the city of Paris at the Hotel de Ville at 2:30 p.m. and I have
                            accepted for you.</p>
                        <p>I have told <persName corresp="#p_WSW1">Wiseman</persName> to tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> and <persName

                            December 17, Wednesday December 18, and possibly the 19th free for
                            conferences with them and I expect that both <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1"
                                >Balfour</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CG1">George</persName>
                            will be in Paris on the 17th. December 19 and 20th the King of Italy,
                            the Italian Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Baron
                                Sonnino</persName> will be in Paris. The French and Belgian
                            Governments are most insistent that you should make a trip to the
                            devastated regions of France and Belgium. Accordingly the French
                            Government are making arrangements for you to take a trip beginning
                            December 26 which will occupy approximately 3 days through northern
                            France and Belgium. At the same time it is planned that you should visit
                            our army. Your trip to Italy, which I believe is necessary, might be
                            begun on December 29 or 30th in order that you may return to Paris by
                            January 3 or 4th for the first formal conference of the Allies.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName> has told me that
                            the English elections, the French celebrations, and the official visits
                            to Paris have made it absolutely impossible to begin these formal
                            conferences before January 3 or 4th.</p>
                        <p>Will you please let me know if you wish me to take any particular action

                                <p>“Mr. President. Paris and France were impatiently expecting you.
                                    They were longing to welcome and hail you as the eminent
                                    democrat whose words and deeds are inspired by exalted thought,
                                    as the philosopher who delights in involving universal laws from
                                    private [?], as the prominent statesman, touching the highest
                                    political and moral truths have suggested formulas that bear the
                                    stamp of immortality.</p>
                                <p>They were also passionately yearning to convey, through your
                                    person, their thanks to the great republic whose chief you are,
                                    for the invaluable assistance it has spontaneously bestowed,
                                    during this war, on the defenders of right and liberty. Even
                                    before America had resolved to intervene in the contest she had
                                    shown to the wounded, to the widows, to the orphans of France, a
                                    beneficence and generosity, the memory of which shall never
                                    vanish from our hearts. The donations of your Red Cross, the
                                    innumerable contributions of your fellow citizens, the touching
                                    activities of American women have anticipated your military and
                                    naval action and evinced little by little which way your
                                    sympathies were leaning. And from the day when you threw
                                    yourselves into the midst of the battle [garbled groups].</p>
                                <p>A few months ago you cabled to me that the United States would
                                    send to invaded France ever increasing forces able to submerge
                                    the enemy under an overwhelming flow of new divisions. And, in
                                    fact, flowing more than a year a continuous tide of youth and
                                    energy has poured on to the shores of France. No sooner had they
                                    landed, than your gallant battalions fired by their chief,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_PGJJ1">General Pershing</persName>,
                                    rushed into the fight with such manly contempt of danger, such
                                    smiling disregard of death, that our old experience of this
                                    terrific war often felt incited to counsel prudence.</p>
                                <p>They have come here with the enthusiasm of crusaders leaving for

                                    heart the common achievement and to deem their courage and faith
                                    a mighty help thereto.</p>
                                <p>Eager as they were to meet the enemy, they were yet unaware when
                                    they arrived of his monstrous crimes. To obtain a proper view of
                                    the German conduct of war, they had to witness the
                                    systematically burnt down cities, the flooded mines and the
                                    crumbling factories, the devastated orchards, of many shelled
                                    and fired cathedrals, the whole device of that savage war waged
                                    against national wealth, nature, beauty, which the imagination
                                    is unable to conceive at a distance from the men and things that
                                    have endured it and that still give evidence thereof. You will
                                    have the opportunity, Mr. President, to inspect with your own
                                    eyes the extent of that disaster. The French Government will
                                    also furnish you with authentic documents in which the German
                                    general staff develops with astounding cynicism its plan of
                                    plunder and industrial annihilation. Your noble conscience will
                                    return a verdict on its guilt.</p>
                                <p>Should it remain unpunished, could it be renewed, the most
                                    splendid victories would be useless. Mr. President, France has
                                    striven, has patiently toiled, during four long years she has
                                    bled at every pore, she has lost the best of her children, she
                                    mourns for her young sons. She aspires now even as you do to a
                                    peace of justice and safety.</p>
                                <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0216"/>
                                <p>She did not intend that such an aggression might be renewed, when
                                    she submitted to such sacrifices. Nor did you intend to allow
                                    uncondemned criminals to lift up their heads again and to
                                    prepare new murders when America, under your strong impulse,
                                    armed herself and crossed the ocean. Keeping a true remembrance
                                    of Lafayette and Rochambeau, she came to relieve France because
                                    France herself was true to her traditions. Our common ideal has
                                    conquered. Together we have stood for the vital principles of
                                    free societies, together we must now build such a peace as will
                                    not permit the deliberate and underhand reconstruction of
                                    organisms aiming at conquest and oppression. The peace must make
                                    amends for the general hardship and sorrows of yesterday; it
                                    must be a guarantee against the perils of tomorrow. The
                                    association which has been formed, in view of the war, between
                                    the United States and the Allies and which contains the germ of
                                    the permanent institution you have outlined with such eloquence,
                                    will, from this day find its decisions of profitable use in the
                                    concerted study of just decisions, in the mutual support we all
                                    need in order to make our rights prevail. Whatever precautions
                                    we may take for the future, no one, unfortunately, can assert
                                    that we shall forever spare to mankind the horrors of new wars.
                                    Five years ago, the progress of a science and the state of
                                    civilization ought to have led to hope that no government,
                                    however autocratic, would succeed in hurling nations in arms
                                    against Belgium and Servia. Without cherishing the illusion that
                                    posterity may forever be completely safe from such collective
                                    madness, we must introduce into the peace we are going to build
                                    all the conditions of justice and probabilities of duration that
                                    we can insert in it. To such a vast and magnificent task you
                                    have chosen, Mr. President, to come and to apply yourself hand
                                    in hand with France. France expresses its gratefulness to you.
                                    She knows America’s friendship. She is aware of your rectitude
                                    and nobility of thought. With full confidence she is ready to
                                    work with you.</p>
                                <p>I raise my glass, Mr. President, in yours and Mrs. <persName

                                    say that while he greatly regrets the necessity for postponing

                                    third or fourth of January, he is of course willing to acquiesce

                                    as may be mutually agreeable upon conference after his arrival.
                                    But he wishes <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0217"/>me to ask
                                    if it would not be possible, in some tactful way that would not
                                    give offence or be misunderstood, to avoid the demonstration of

                                    recalls the criticisms already made by those interested in
                                    opposing his principles with regard to the source of the popular

                                <p>“Mr. President: I am deeply indebted to you for your gracious
                                    greeting. It is very delightful to find myself in France and to
                                    feel the quick contact of sympathy and unaffected friendship
                                    between the representatives of the United States and the
                                    representatives of France. You have been very generous in what
                                    you were pleased to say about myself, but I feel that what I
                                    have said and what I have tried to do has been said and done
                                    only in an attempt to speak the thought of the people of the
                                    United States truly and to carry that thought out in action.
                                    From the first, the thought of the people of the United States
                                    turned toward something more than the mere winning of this war.
                                    It turned to the establishment of eternal principles of right
                                    and justice. It realized that merely to win the war was not
                                    enough; that it must be won in such a way and the questions
                                    raised by it settled in such a way as to insure the future peace
                                    of the world and lay the foundation for the freedom and
                                    happiness of its many peoples and nations.</p>
                                <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0218"/>
                                <p>“Never before has war worn so terrible a visage or exhibited more
                                    grossly the debasing influences of illicit ambitions. I am sure
                                    that I shall look upon the ruin wrought by the armies of the
                                    Central Empires with the same repulsion and deep indignation
                                    that they stir in the hearts of the men of France and of
                                    Belgium, and I appreciate as you do, Sir, the necessity of such
                                    action in the final settlement of the issues of the war as will
                                    not only rebuke such acts of terror and spoliation, but make men
                                    everywhere aware that they cannot be ventured upon without the
                                    certainty of just punishment.</p>
                                <p>“I know with what ardor and enthusiasm the soldiers and sailors
                                    of the United States have given the best that was in them to
                                    this war of redemption. They have expressed the true spirit of
                                    America. They believe their ideals to be acceptable to free
                                    peoples everywhere, and are rejoiced to have played the part
                                    they have played in giving reality to those ideals in
                                    cooperation with the armies of the Allies. We are proud of the
                                    part they have played, and we are happy that they should have
                                    been associated with such comrades in a common cause.</p>
                                <p>“It is with peculiar feelings, Mr. President, that I find myself
                                    in France joining with you in rejoicing over the victory that
                                    has been won. The ties that bind France and the United States
                                    are peculiarly close. I do not know in what other comradeship we
                                    could have fought with more zest or enthusiasm. It will daily be
                                    a matter of pleasure with me to be brought into consultation
                                    with the statesmen of France and her Allies in concerting the
                                    measures by which we may secure permanence for these happy
                                    relations of friendship and cooperation, and secure for the
                                    world at large such safety and freedom in its life as can be
                                    secured only by the constant association and cooperation of
                                    friends.</p>
                                <p>“I greet you, Sir, not only with deep personal respect, but as
                                    the representative of the great people of France, and beg to
                                    bring you the greetings of another great people to whom the
                                    fortunes of France are of profound and lasting interest”.</p>

                                    members, the socialist party, which, at the beginning of the

                                    you that your hope of speaking to the masses, which had until
                                    then been silent, has not been vain. But how could they omit
                                    affirming to you that thousands and thousands of men, women and
                                    children in France, a silent mass, whose ancestors struggled so
                                    for the rights of citizens, are with you in your desire to fix
                                    the rights of nations and to realize the peace of the peoples.
                                    An immense task which will not be the work of a moment for which
                                    the statesman will only be able to sow the fruitful seeds at the
                                    peace conference, and then afterwards count on the good will of
                                    the peoples for the beneficent harvest. It is not mere chance
                                    that today brings the workers, the socialists and the democrats
                                    of France towards you. Thus, it follows, French labor believes
                                    the world must be ripe for democracy. It is with that object in
                                    view that you have laid down your fourteen articles of peace.
                                    The peoples now expect the rapid peace will record and define
                                    exactly the fourteen peace stipulations in order that the

                        <p>President of the Council wishes me to communicate to you immediately
                            following part of long and satisfactory conversation which he yesterday
                            had with President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Latter informed him that he was anxious to attend the Peace Conference.
                            He added that if the Conference declared that they preferred that he
                            should not attend, he would quite understand, but he nevertheless
                            desired that his wishes in the matter should be known.</p>
                        <p>On the President of the Council pointing out that other Heads of States
                            might wish to attend the Conference and that difficulties might arise in
                            consequence, President stated that he would attend as Head of the U. S.
                            Government and not in his capacity of President. He pointed out that the
                            case of the U. S. of America was different from those of France and
                            England, as in the latter countries nothing could be done by the Heads
                            of States without the approval of the President of the Council and the
                            Prime Minister respectively, whereas in the United States nothing could
                            be done without reference to him. He <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150"
                                facs="0220"/>would not dream of urging that he should preside at the
                            Conference, as that was clearly the prerogative of Monsieur <persName
                                corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName>, but he strongly pressed
                            that he should be permitted to be present.</p>
                        <p>The President of the Council asks me to let you know that although he was
                            at first very strongly opposed to the idea he is now of the opinion that
                            the President ought to be allowed to attend the Conference as a member
                            and he himself intends to support his request. He feels sure that if it
                            became known that the President had expressed a wish to be present and
                            had been refused the effect would be very bad, at any rate in France. He
                            would be grateful for your views and those of the Prime Minister with
                            regard to the President’s proposal.</p>

                        <p>Before finally declining invitation to visit Vatican, hope you will
                            consider influence <persName>Pope</persName> can wield in favor of your
                            ideals among free peoples of all countries in case an appeal to world

                            advantage. Misstep in this matter may be most hurtful. While there is
                            political danger in visit, the larger aspects must be considered. The
                            great issue which you are pushing forward in Europe and throughout the
                            world will depend upon the popular sentiment behind you throughout
                            Europe. The Vatican can help in this. We should use every instrument
                            that can help you in this great hour. If you succeed—which is
                            certain—visits to Vatican will be forgotten in realization of larger

                            to return Paris. Government desires plan only what meets with approval
                            of the President and any suggestions modifications of above plans will
                            be very much appreciated by Government which is awaiting a reply, before

                        <p>5. [From <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">House</persName>.] The President
                            will leave Paris on Wednesday evening, January 1st., arriving Rome
                            Friday morning, stopping 2 hours at Turin enroute. He will call at
                            Vatican. He will also call upon the American Protestant denominations in
                            Rome, and I suggest that they meet together at one place in order that
                            the President may make a single visit instead of several. It would be
                            advisable for him to leave Rome on Saturday night at such an hour as to
                            bring him to Genoa at about nine where he would lay wreath at foot of
                            Statue of Columbus. He would then proceed to Milan and after stopping
                            there a couple of hours will leave, via Turin without stopping there
                            again, for Paris, arriving on Monday morning. It is understood that the
                            Italian government has already dispatched special train to Paris for the
                            President’s party. <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Edward

                        <p>58. I hear that propaganda is going on against the President in Paris and
                            that a number of French propagandists are going prospectively to America
                            to take part in a propaganda against him there. I have mentioned this
                            report to my French Colleague and suggested that it be looked into. Some
                            of the American Colony might be looked after.</p>

                        <p>65. Political: President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>’s
                            brief but very successful visit to Italy has been the noted event of
                            last two weeks. He arrived Rome Friday, Jan. 4th, and left next night
                            for Milan, thence to Genoa and Turin, returning to France Sunday night.
                            Everywhere he received enthusiastic reception from all classes,
                            including the more or less troublesome labor classes of the North. At
                            Milan Executive Committee of Regular Socialists had passed resolution
                            calling on members to pay no homage to <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                >Wilson</persName> which had no effect, President being cordially
                            received by Socialist Mayor <persName>Caldara</persName> and by
                            organized Socialist Labor. Turin, he was met by large and notable labor
                            representation. This would seem to discredit and make of little value
                            attacks on President by <hi rend="italic">Avanti</hi>, the radical
                            Socialist organ, especially since all other papers of every political
                            leaning united in editorial comment <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154"
                                facs="0224"/>very favorable to him. Naples was disappointed, and
                            Florence disgruntled at not receiving visit, indeed in Florentine papers
                            there appeared no editorial comment at all. But the visit was a great
                            success and the President’s speeches have been reprinted everywhere and
                            have made a profound impression throughout Italy. Whatever others may
                            say, the people of Italy have unbounded confidence in him. Visit to
                                <persName>Pope</persName> caused no hostile criticisms, the country
                            understanding that he visited the <persName>Pope</persName> only as
                            religious head of American Catholics, and that it had no political
                            significance. This visit was followed by one to the representatives of
                            the Protestant bodies in Italy.</p>
                        <p>The state luncheon given at the American Embassy in his name to Their
                            Majesties, the King and Queen, was attended by Their Majesties, and by
                            the principal Ministers, members of the Court, the Ambassadors of the
                            Allies, the Mayor of Rome, and other high officials. It was the first
                            time that Their Majesties have ever accepted an invitation to an
                            Embassy. The luncheon was considered a great success from the
                            diplomatic, as well as the social point of view.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: From the German acceptance of
                            your terms which we received yesterday, it looks as if the Peace
                            Conference might be close upon us.</p>
                        <p>Germany seems so nearly in collapse that I cannot believe that it will be
                            necessary for a peace conference to continue more than two and a half to
                            three months. It looks as if the Allies might be able to lay down their
                            own terms, and if <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName>
                            will cooperate with us as closely as he did last year at the
                            Inter-Allied Conference, it will greatly shorten the life of the
                            congress. It merely needs a little organization and some understanding
                            amongst the principals to have matters expedited in a way that is quite
                            unusual at such gatherings.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing you a list of people which I hope you will think well to
                            have come over to advise when these several subjects come before the
                            congress. It will strengthen the American position and facilitate the
                            work of the commissioners to have such a staff, and it will leave the
                            commissioners free to discuss fundamentals.</p>
                        <p>I do not give the personnel of the Peace Inquiry as that is almost wholly
                            composed of experts on technical subjects.</p>
                        <p>I am writing this on shipboard so it may return with this boat.</p>

                            Conference. <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName> remarked
                            that half of France wanted to be <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0227"
                            />present and <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName>
                            replied that he was lucky for all England wished to attend. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName> said he would be compelled
                            to appoint among others a man from the Colonies and a labor
                            representative. We agreed to postpone final discussion until they had
                            time to think about it further.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that England, France, Italy and the United States should each
                            have five places at the table, the other belligerent powers to have
                            representation varying from one to three places according to their
                            relative importance. This seemed to meet with their approval. I had in
                            mind that Germany should also have five places.</p>
                        <p>It is essential that the sittings should contain only a limited number
                            for we have found it difficult to transact business satisfactorily at
                            Versailles, and it was necessary for the Prime Ministers to meet in
                            advance in order that business might be facilitated.</p>
                        <p>The smaller countries like Belgium, Serbia and Greece have been quite
                            contented to have one place each at the Versailles sittings.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate an expression of your opinion.</p>

                            circumstances are delaying an agreement respecting important points
                            connected with the constitution of the Peace Conference and the
                            procedure to be followed therein. <persName corresp="#p_CG1"
                                >George</persName> and the other members of the English Government

                            unwilling until the elections are over to decide definitely how many
                            delegates they will wish to nominate, and who these delegates will be.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_CG1">George</persName> is defeated of course
                            considerable confusion respecting this matter will result. If <persName

                            radical changes in his Cabinet which may affect the make-up of the

                            three. He would then head the French delegation and would have with him

                            almost complete control. If it is decided that there shall be more than
                            three delegates <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName> would

                                <persName>Aristide Briand</persName>, French President of the
                                Council, Oct. 29, 1915–Mar. 20, 1917.</note> who would act
                            independently and would have a strong following. In Italy the situation,
                            so far as I am informed concerning it, has not taken any very definite
                            shape. <persName corresp="#p_OVE1">Orlando</persName> will of course
                            head the delegation.</p>
                        <p>In view of the uncertainty in connection with this matter, I suggest that
                            no announcement be made concerning our delegation until England, France
                            and Italy are committed to a definite number of delegates. The French
                            are urging that the French language be used as the official language of
                            the Conference. Since the French are to be given the place of meeting
                            and the presidency of the Conference, it would seem as if they should
                            meet the convenience of England and ourselves with respect to the
                            language to be used. At the conferences before the Armistice was signed
                                <persName corresp="#p_OVE1">Orlando</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PS1">Pichon</persName> were the only ones that could not
                            understand English. In addition to ourselves and the English, <persName

                            my own cordial feeling towards Mr. <persName>Bryan</persName>. I should
                            have entire confidence in his principles and in his influence at the
                            conference, but I feel that it is our duty to keep in mind, particularly
                            at this time when all the world is a bit abnormal in its acute
                            sensibilities, the reactions of the public mind of the several countries
                            concerned. Mr. <persName>Bryan</persName> is soft-hearted, and the world
                            just now is very hard-hearted. It would render a very large and
                            influential body of our public opinion very uneasy if they thought that
                            peace was to be approached in the spirit which they would attribute to
                            Mr. <persName>Bryan</persName>. I think it highly important to hold
                            opinion steady and calm, and for that reason I do not think that it
                            would be wise to include Mr. <persName>Bryan</persName> among the
                            commissioners, much as it would personally gratify me to do so.</p>

                            from the President. It seems to me that we are justified in insisting on
                            five delegates. It would be extremely embarrassing to us to have fewer
                            than five. I do not understand that any government can be arbitrarily
                            limited, except by agreement. I think also with you that we are entirely
                            justified in insisting upon the English language being officially
                            sanctioned and used at the conference as well as French. The limitation
                            to French would greatly embarrass us, if only in the matter of constant
                            translation, for which we haven’t a suitable confidential force. You
                            will remember that English is the diplomatic language of the Pacific. I
                            would be very much obliged if you would cable whether it would be
                            necessary or wise for us to bring any domestic servants with us. We are
                            exceedingly distressed by the news of your illness and beg that you will
                            take extra good care of yourself. We all unite in affectionate
                            messages.</p>

                            </hi>: I have received a great many messages besides your own very
                            interesting and persuasive message with regard to appointing a
                            representative of labor on the Peace Commission, and have of course
                            given the matter the most serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>I have at the same time received equally strong appeals to appoint a
                            representative of the agricultural interests of the country, a
                            representative of the socialistic bodies of the country, a
                            representative of the women of the country, and many other similar
                            suggestions. I am not putting all of these upon a par. I am merely
                            illustrating the fact that many special bodies and interests of our
                            complex nation have felt, and felt very naturally, a desire to have
                            special spokesmen among the peace delegates.</p>
                        <p>I must say, however, that my own feeling is that the peace delegates
                            should represent no portion of our people in particular, but the country
                            as a whole, and that it was unwise to make any selection on the ground
                            that the man selected represented a particular group or interest, for
                            after all each interest is, or should be, related to the whole, and no
                            proper representative of the country could fail to have in mind the
                            great and all-pervasive interest of labor or of any other great body of
                            humanity.</p>
                        <p>The number of delegates will be small, and I have thought that therefore
                            special representation was out of the question.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am inexpressibly
                            grieved at the resignation of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWG1"
                                >McAdoo</persName>, though I can readily understand that the
                            terrible burdens of his work have made it necessary for him to have more
                            rest than it would be impossible [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for him to
                            get, here in Washington continuing at the pace he has gone for the past
                            two or three years.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that Mac’s resignation changes essentially the possibility
                            of my going abroad as a member of the peace commission. Of course, with
                            you in Europe neither I nor anybody else is necessary to the
                            presentation of America’s case, but here at home, particularly during
                            your absence, I can perhaps be helpful in conference with the remaining
                            members of the Cabinet. The next two or three months are likely to
                            present situations of uncertainty of opinion and hesitancy on the part
                            of business and labor in process of readjustment, and while no fresh
                            legislative policy perhaps needs to be worked out, I am persuaded that
                            the country would feel more concerned about your own absence if two
                            members of the Cabinet were with you now that the Secretary of the
                            Treasury’s post will have to be filled by a man new to those
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>I trust you will understand the spirit of this suggestion, but I am
                            really deeply concerned not only to have your own stay in Europe made as
                            free from anxiety as possible but to have the situation here kept on the
                            even balance and public feeling and opinion kept in sympathy with both
                            the things you are doing abroad and the policies of the economic and
                            political readjustment here which you desire to have our peace-time
                            establishment take.</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0240"/>
                        <p>May I not suggest for your consideration the possibility of making
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGTH1">General Bliss</persName> a peace
                            commissioner? And then after the conferences have gone so far that you
                            feel you are able to return here, and leave the details to be reduced to
                            writing for signature, if you then thought it wise I could be sent over
                            to join the commissioners at the windup.</p>

                        <p>152. Secret for the President. Among the important questions which will
                            arise not only at the Peace Conference but probably also at the
                            preliminary Inter-Allied conferences will be those pertaining
                            particularly to finance, commerce and the use of our raw material and
                            food. The whole world is vitally interested in what manner we propose to
                            use our great strength in finance and in raw material. England, France
                            and Italy participants [<hi rend="italic">display?</hi>] perhaps more
                            interest in these questions than in almost any others. I suggest the
                            advisability of your taking steps to secure a small body of advisers on
                            these subjects either to come with you or to be ready to come over on

                        <p>164. I have just received a communication from <persName>Lord

                            authorities that there will be no objection to the number being fixed.
                            Accordingly, I modify my suggestion contained in my number 126 that no
                            announcement be made concerning our delegation until arbitrators are
                            committed to a definite number. I now see no reason why you should not

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> agrees: “That
                            delegates on panel system would suit us best.” I am not entirely certain
                            what this means. It may mean that England might appoint any number of
                            delegates, only five of which could sit at any one time. I shall ask for
                            further explanation of this and will advise you promptly. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSW1">Wiseman</persName> also says that Mr. <persName

                            considerable [difficulty?] in inducing the French to meet our views on
                            the language question. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>

                        <p>201. Secret for <persName corresp="#p_PFL1">Polk</persName> from
                                <persName corresp="#p_AG1">Auchincloss</persName>. With the approval
                            of the <persName type="to" corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel</persName>, I am
                            informally trying to get the financial, shipping and general economic
                            representatives of the United States in Europe prepared in some measure
                            for the Inter-Allied conferences and the Peace Conference. At the
                            present time I am requested to get them to ascertain as nearly as
                            possible along what lines their British and French colleagues expect to
                            proceed in these conferences. Of course this work is entirely informal
                            inasmuch as none of these men have been specifically selected by the
                            President to do this work. Most likely they are the necessary United
                            States representatives on the spot or in prospect, who have any
                            knowledge of these matters which are sure to be of vital importance at
                            the Conference. At the present time the Treasury Department is well
                            represented by <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> with whom I
                            have had a number of long talks. … <persName corresp="#p_HEN1"
                                >Hurley</persName> of course represents our Shipping Board and I am
                            in close touch with him. <persName corresp="#p_SRB1">Stevens</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG2">Rublee</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MDW1">Morrow</persName> who are in London are available
                            for this work, but I am not sure that <persName corresp="#p_HEN1"
                                >Hurley</persName> will be willing to call upon them as long as he
                            is over here. <persName corresp="#p_SLL1">Summers</persName>, provided
                            some of his organization is left here to help him, is entirely able to
                            look after the raw material questions. The Food Administration work is
                            being handled by <persName corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName> together
                            with the general <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0245"/>relief work.
                            Inasmuch as the <persName type="to" corresp="#p_HCEM1"
                                >Colonel</persName> could not see <persName corresp="#p_HHC1"
                                >Hoover</persName> when he was here I have been working matters out
                            with him. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">McFadden</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SLP1">Sheldon</persName> and, if necessary, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWAW1">Stewart</persName>, with all of whom I have been
                            in conference, are available for War Trade Board and general commercial
                            work. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">McFadden</persName> seems to me to be
                            the ablest of these, but <persName corresp="#p_SLP1">Sheldon</persName>
                            has a very intimate knowledge of the situation and is most helpful. The
                            Alien Property Custodian has no representative here and according to the
                            list received from the Department of those coming with the President you
                            apparently do not intend to send such a representative to Europe at this
                            time. I strongly suggest that you get the Department to send some one
                            over to represent the Alien Property Custodian. Would it be possible to
                            send <persName>Bradley Palmer</persName>?<note n="33" xml:id="d165fn33"
                                >Assistant Counsel to the Alien Property Custodian.</note> It would
                            seem to me he would be very useful.</p>
                        <p>At lunch yesterday when a number of the above representatives were
                            present, they urged that an attempt be made to bring them together every
                            day to compare notes so as to afford greater coordination of their
                            efforts. Occasionally amazingly contradictory telegrams go through to
                            Washington and this ought to be avoided. I am taking steps informally to
                            bring about greater cooperation pursuant to the wishes of these
                            gentlemen. I send you the above for your information. The British are
                            bringing over a very large body of financial and economic
                            representatives and we have simply got to be prepared to meet them and
                            to advise our delegates. My personal opinion has always been (and this
                            has been reinforced by information received since I have been here) that
                            economic questions will be at the basis of almost every dispute which
                            will arise at the conferences and accordingly I think we ought to make
                            some effort to prepare the facts upon which the President can adopt the
                            policy of the United States respecting these matters. I would be glad
                            [to] have your comment on the above.</p>

                        <p>Up to the present we have for this purpose drawn upon the Army and Navy
                            for a considerable number of officers, especially fitted for the
                            particular duties allotted to them, who have been temporarily assigned
                            to the Commission and who have necessarily been quartered provisionally
                            in the Hotel Crillon as other quarters in Paris are practically
                            unobtainable. Rooms in the Crillon have already been assigned to all of
                            the persons listed in the Department’s 75, November 26, 7 p.m., and 92,
                            November 29, 5 p.m., as well as to Colonel and Mrs. <persName

                            whatever regarding the assignment of these officers to the Commission
                            and am considerably embarrassed by their unannounced arrival, having

                            rooms to them at the Crillon and office space at 4 Place de la Concorde.
                            Please instruct me further in the premises.</p>
                        <p>As matters now stand we are in a position to offer the Commissioners
                            Plenipotentiary on the day of their arrival every possible facility
                            which could have been foreseen. However the offices in the two buildings
                            at 4 Place de la Concorde and 3 Rue Royale have now all been allotted
                            and the available bedrooms, salons and offices in the Hotel Crillon will
                            not permit us to expand much further unless we oblige some of the
                            officers assigned to us to find accommodations elsewhere which is now
                            practically impossible in Paris. I cannot foresee until the Commission
                            arrives and enters upon its work whether further expansion will be
                            necessary but should this prove to be the case we shall be obliged to
                            endeavor to requisition another small hotel in the vicinity.</p>
                        <p>All of these steps have been taken after consultation with and approval
                            by <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName>.</p>

                        <p>3. From <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName>. In view of the
                            Department’s decision that the telegraphic communications of the
                            Commission will not be handled by the Navy at the Washington end,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAWS1">Admiral Benson</persName> has informed
                            me through Commander Ingersoll that the Navy does not wish to handle the
                            Paris end, which would entail divided responsibility. Accordingly, upon
                            the arrival of personnel from the State Department, the Navy will
                            withdraw its personnel now assisting us and has already released the
                            reserve communication personnel of the Navy now being held in
                            London.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to foresee how large a corps of coding clerks will be
                            required by the Commission, but it is probable that the six men being
                            sent out by the Department will eventually be far from adequate. <pb

                        <p>153. For <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName>. Your No. 3,
                            December 8th. I had nothing to do with the arrangements for handling
                            telegraphic communications. Fear Navy’s attitude in Paris result of
                            resentment. Urge you to hold situation as it is until arrival
                            President’s party. <persName corresp="#p_PPH1">Patchin</persName> can
                            explain situation as he and <persName corresp="#p_PW1"
                                >Phillips</persName> were responsible for present arrangement. Think
                            it would be most unfortunate if any radical change is made by Navy
                            before you have an opportunity to discuss the matter with Secretary of
                            State. Suggest you take the matter up with the <persName type="to"
                                corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel</persName> immediately and have necessary
                            officers held as it would be most unfortunate to have the mission
                            crippled through any inter-Departmental rivalries. Show this telegram to
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPH1">Patchin</persName> on his arrival; he
                            knows my views. Will take matter up with <persName corresp="#p_PW1"

                            and strictly confidential. Various persons returning recently from Paris
                            seem to be impressed by the fact that the organization of the Mission
                            includes a good many Americans still in army who are prominent socially,
                            although otherwise not of pronounced ability. Senators and
                            Representatives are daily approaching the Department with requests to
                            have their constituents, many of whom are men of ability, attached to
                            our Mission and it might be somewhat embarrassing if the impression
                            became general that a large number of men were being appointed because
                            of their social prominence. I thoroughly appreciate your difficulty and
                            the necessity of building up quickly an organization but am sure you
                            will forgive me for this word of caution.</p>

                            day before your party landed at Brest.</p>
                        <p>“When the party to accompany the Peace Commissioners was made up in
                            America, the Secretary of War was to be with the President, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGM1">General Churchill</persName>, Chief, M.
                            I. D., selected a group of experts from his department to act as a staff
                            for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRS1">Baker</persName>. Later <persName
                                corresp="#p_CGM1">General Churchill</persName> was informed that for
                            the present at least, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRS1">Baker</persName>
                            was not to accompany the President; however, <persName corresp="#p_CGM1"
                                >General Churchill</persName> was told to bring the men he had
                            selected and, in answer to an inquiry of his, was told that the
                            President knew of the plan to keep these military intelligence men in
                            the party.</p>
                        <p>“There seems to be a considerable amount of feeling in the State
                            Department that this making of peace should be a State Department affair
                            and that whatever participation the War Department has should be
                            distinctly under the direction of the State Department. Hence the group
                            of men brought over with <persName corresp="#p_CGM1">General
                                Churchill</persName> failed to receive much of a cordial reception

                            says they have been carefully chosen, have available a wealth of

                        <p>The Intelligence Section of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace,
                            dealing with the territorial, economic, and political matters which come
                            before the peace conference, represents a new idea in international
                            relations—the idea of utilizing the expert services of scholars in
                            determining the facts that should be the bases of the peace settlements.
                            The Intelligence Section is an outgrowth of the Inquiry, a groups of men
                            engaged during more than a year past in gathering material for the peace
                            conference under the direction of <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel
                                House</persName>. Similar organizations have been at work in France
                            and England.</p>
                        <p>In all three countries, so far as is known, the choice of men was made
                            irrespective of political standing, and solely with the view of securing
                            the best scholars in their respective fields. The idea was also
                            entertained that the meeting of these expert bodies at the peace
                            conference would greatly diminish the cares and responsibilities of the
                            plenipotentiaries, whose time would necessarily be filled with the
                            active and current business of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Actual experience at the peace conference has shown the soundness of
                            these anticipations, since in almost every case the discussion of a
                            question has involved the appointment of special committees who are to
                            hear the facts and report to the Bureau. It is surprising to what an
                            extent the impartial discussion of disputed points has led to unanimity
                            of opinion, even on the part of nations directly interested in a given
                            solution. The whole process marks a new stage in the development of
                            better international relations, since it carries over into the field of
                            international relations the good will which has always existed in the
                            world between scholars expert in the same subject. It may be doubted
                            whether at any time in the future complicated problems of world politics
                            will be discussed without reference to expert bodies like those now
                            working out the intricacies of European politics, ethnography,
                            resources, waterways, ports, railroads, canals, topography, etc.</p>
                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0254"/>
                        <p>The experiment has been attended by some very interesting results. In the
                            case of the American experts an appeal was made to the colleges and
                            universities and private and public institutions of various kinds in the
                            United States for the loan of men and material, and to all such requests
                            the most hearty response was obtained. It became a kind of joint
                            educational enterprise which elicited the enthusiasm and devotion of a
                            large group of strong men at a time of need when everyone was seeking to
                            be of the largest service to the national government.</p>
                        <p>The work of the American experts was carried on at the building of the
                            American Geographical Society, Broadway and 156th Street, New York City,
                            where there was made available the largest collection of carefully
                            selected maps in the United States and the best geographical library as
                            well, including the services of a trained staff. The building was well
                            guarded so that during the entire time of its existence the Inquiry lost
                            none of its material, and was able to work quietly and effectively
                            against the day when it would be called upon for service at the peace
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>The interest of the Administration in the work is shown by the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCEM1">Colonel House</persName> held a number
                            of important consultations there, and likewise the Secretary of State.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName> himself visited
                            the Inquiry on October 12, 1918, meeting some of the principal men
                            engaged upon its work and examining in some detail the material that
                            they had gathered.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Inquiry is Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MSE1">S. E.
                                Mezes</persName>, who has traveled widely in Europe and Northern
                            Africa, and has from the first directed the activities of the staff and
                            is now Director of the Intelligence Section of the American

                                <item>There is to be complete control over the employment of the

                        <p>The American Peace Commission should do whatever is necessary to make it
                            clearly understood by everyone that, now that the war is finished and
                            until it should be resumed (which God forbid), this Commission is the
                            highest and most important governmental agency of the United States now
                            in Europe.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, recommended: <list>

                                <item>That approval of the Commission be given to the proposition

                                <item>That the first few minutes of each meeting of the Commission
                                    be devoted to the transaction of routine business connected with
                                    its interior administration; that during this time (if not
                                    longer) the Secretary (by whatever title he may be designated)

                                <item>Incidentally, it is suggested that it might be well to keep a
                                    very brief, formal record of every meeting of the Commission,
                                    stating the matters discussed and the conclusions, tentative or
                                    final, reached. Experience with the Supreme War Council
                                    indicates that this is the practice of the Allied Governments in
                                    the work of commissions of importance.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>It is believed that there is a tendency to overload the
                                    Commission with unnecessary assistant-personnel resulting not
                                    only in having two or more men to do one man’s work but in
                                    considerable unnecessary expense charged for the maintenance of
                                    the Commission. It is possible, for example, that there may be
                                    military or other officials whose opinion may not be asked three
                                    times, if at all, by the Commission or by any member of it
                                    during its lifetime. At the Headquarters of the American
                                    Expeditionary Force there is a very fine and highly trained
                                    organization devoted to the collection of data and the
                                    preparation of memoranda on military subjects of all kinds. The
                                    Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces in
                                    France has stated that he will place at the disposition of the
                                    Commission all assistance under his control. There is a daily
                                    courier service between Paris and his headquarters. A question
                                    requiring a military opinion can be formulated today and by the
                                    first hour in the morning will be in the hands of that highly
                                    trained, specialized organization. In many cases the reply will
                                    be on its return to Paris the same night. This, undoubtedly, is
                                    the way in which such matters will be handled by the French
                                    Peace Commission. They will be referred to the French General
                                    Staff in Paris for its opinion. We have a similar and equally
                                    competent General Staff at Chaumont to pass on military
                                    questions. All that is required here is a very small and
                                    carefully selected personnel that will keep in touch with the
                                    duties of the Commission or of its individual members, will
                                    formulate the necessary questions and will have them transmitted
                                    to Chaumont. Manifestly it would be entirely unnecessary to
                                    bring that specialized staff from Chaumont to Paris and maintain
                                    it here at the expense of the Commission.</item>

                            by the Commission to be made by the Head of each Section as to the
                            necessity of maintaining the personnel now under his charge.</p>

                        <p>The Commissioners Plenipotentiary today adopted the following resolution:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The American Peace Commission should do whatever is necessary to
                                    make it clearly understood by everyone that, now that the war is
                                    finished and until it should be resumed (which God forbid), this
                                    Commission is the highest and most important governmental agency
                                    of the United States now in Europe:</p>
                                <p>It is therefore recommended that the Secretary of the Commission
                                    be given a title which will place him on the same plane of
                                    dignity as in the case of the British Commission.</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>The officer of the British Commission holding the position corresponding
                            to that of the Secretary of the American Commission has been given the
                            title of “Superintending Ambassador”. It would not seem appropriate to
                            give the Secretary of the American Commission this title, as there would
                            be some question as to whether he would not then rank equally with the
                            Commissioners. It is therefore proposed that he be given the title of
                            “Supervising Director with Ministerial Rank.”</p>
                        <p>It is also recommended that the two Assistant Secretaries of the
                            Commission be made Secretaries with the rank of Counselors of Embassy,
                            in order that they may be in a position to deal on equal terms with
                            their colleagues on the other peace commissions.</p>
                        <p>A telegram<note n="42" xml:id="d180fn42">Not printed.</note> has been
                            sent to Washington to have three new commissions, bearing the seal of
                            the United States, sent out by mail to be filled in in accordance with
                            the foregoing recommendations, if approved by the President; but in
                            order that there may be no delay in establishing the rank of these three
                            officials, and in order that <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0258"
                            />they may be correctly announced to the Office of Protocol in the
                            French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is suggested that the President
                            provisionally authorize the adoption of the titles suggested above.</p>

                                corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName>. Your 53, December 19, 4 p.m. I
                            fully appreciate your friendly word of caution and assure you that it
                            will at all times be of great help to have you bring criticisms of our
                            organization to my attention. As a matter of fact the criticism in this
                            instance is quite unjustified, and I have traced similar comments,
                            circulating in Paris, to certain persons which [<hi rend="italic"
                                >who</hi>] without justification have been hostile to our
                            organization from the start and which I can explain to you only in
                            person. The situation is fully known to and understood by the
                            Commission[ers Plenipotentiary?] who have approved of the organization
                            as they found it. I think the criticisms which have come to you in
                            Washington can be satisfactorily answered by the following facts: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We now have 66 Army officers assigned to the Commission from
                                    the A. E. F. of whom a considerable number, including
                                    interpreters, reported under direct instructions from the War
                                    Department. Of these 66 only 11 were known to me personally at
                                    the time of their selection and only 6 others were known to me
                                    even by name. Of the total number small percentage may be said
                                    to be prominent socially, although the term is of course
                                    relative and misleading.</item>

                                <item>These men were selected upon high recommendation after a
                                    careful examination into their records, ability and special
                                    qualifications for certain duties and not one has failed to make
                                    good in the work assigned to him. I consider that all have
                                    pronounced ability.</item>

                                <item>Having been guided by efficiency, not favoritism, we have
                                    refused the application of a very great number of men, who may
                                    be said to be socially prominent, on the ground that they were
                                    not of pronounced ability.</item>

                                <item>Those officers assigned to the Commission who may be said to
                                    be socially prominent, were selected on account of their
                                    thorough knowledge of French and their affiliations with various
                                    branches of the French Government and the diplomatic corps and
                                    various civilian activities in France. The efficiency of the
                                    organization depended upon the selection of certain men with
                                    these particular qualifications.</item>

                                <item>The short time given us to build up the organization before
                                    the arrival of the Commission necessitated our selecting men

                            Major Birch Helms as a special military attaché or intelligence officer
                            to assist in obtaining information for the Commission relative to the
                            Republican sentiment in the United States, to transmit correct and
                            accurate data to Republican leaders who may be <pb n="190"
                                xml:id="pg_190" facs="0260"/>in Paris, and to have authority to
                            attend conferences of the Peace Commission with newspaper
                            correspondents, and also to confer occasionally with members of the
                            Commission so that correct data can be transmitted to Republican leaders
                            in the United States independent of press despatches.</p>

                        <p>The Commissioners instructed the Secretary of the Commission to prepare a
                            telegram to the Acting Secretary of State requesting him to send out an

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lansing</persName> brought up the question
                            of the status, in their relation to the Commission, of Mr. <persName

                                >Baruch</persName>, and other advisors. The question arose in
                            connection with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HEN1">Hurley</persName>’s
                            request for an assignment of rooms for himself and his wife at the Hotel
                            Crillon; and also his request that the Department of State be authorized
                            by the Commission to issue a passport to France to Mrs.
                                <persName>Robinson</persName>, the wife of his assistant, who
                            proposes to sail on the <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> tomorrow. The
                            Commissioners decided that the question of the status of these officials
                            should be submitted to the President, and directed the Secretary of the
                            Commission to prepare a memorandum to the President on this subject.
                            They also decided that until the status of these officials was settled,
                            the Department of State, and not the Commission, should assume the
                            responsibility for issuing passports for their families. A telegram to
                            the Acting Secretary of State to this effect was prepared.<note n="45"

                            then led to the recent election victory of <persName corresp="#p_LGD1"

                        <p>61. Secret for the President and Secretary of State. We are getting a
                            mass of misinformation respecting present conditions in Austria, Bohemia
                            and the Ukraine, practically all of which is being provided us by the
                            English, French and Italians. We have no American sources of
                            information. The reports received are, as they are often, colored by the
                            self interest of the persons furnishing them. I regard it as exceedingly
                            important that we send at once to these countries agents who will be in
                            a position to furnish us with accurate and unbiased information
                            respecting conditions. This work should be under the general direction
                            of a man who is entirely familiar with German and Austrian affairs. I
                            suggest that you constitute <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName>
                            a special representative of the Department of State to do this work. Of
                            course he should have a number of assistants whom I can secure for him
                            over here. If you approve of this suggestion I will take the necessary
                            steps to set up the organization. This matter I believe is most
                            urgent.</p>

                        <p>At the present time the United States officials in Europe charged with
                            considering political and economic questions presented by the <pb
                                n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0265"/>termination of the war are
                            receiving practically no dependable information concerning political and
                            economic conditions in the following countries: Poland, Bohemia,
                            Ukraine, Austria, Servia, (including Yugo-Slavia), Hungary, Bulgaria,
                            Albania and Turkey. From Roumania and Greece some information is
                            obtained but it is very incomplete. I consider it essential that we at
                            once set up instrumentalities in these localities which will furnish us
                            with information concerning political conditions in these countries and
                            that this information should come to us through American eyes. I do not
                            think it will be difficult promptly to set up an organization for this
                            purpose and I suggest that I be authorized to proceed along the
                            following lines: <list>
                                <item>Subparagraph A. After conferring with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName> and learning his plans
                                    for relief, to select men from among the United States military
                                    and naval forces now in Europe and from any other available
                                    sources, who shall be appointed for the time being, agents of
                                    the Department of State. These men to constitute the basis of a
                                    “political intelligence section” of the American delegation to
                                    the Peace Conference.</item>
                                <item>Subparagraph B. To despatch the men so selected as soon as
                                    practicable to do so, to points such as Warsaw, Lemberg, Posen,
                                    Prague, Berne [<hi rend="italic">Brün?</hi>] (Moravia) Budapest,
                                    Vienna, Innsbruck or Salzburg, Belgrade, Agram, Serajevo, Sofia,
                                    Bucharest (and some point in Transylvania), Kief, Scutari,
                                    Constantinople and Odessa. One agent should be sent to each
                                    place and he should take with him one code clerk with codes, one
                                    stenographer and if necessary one interpreter. A courier service
                                    also will shortly have to be established to operate between the
                                    United States and individual agents and their base from which
                                    messages could be forwarded by telegraph to Paris.</item>
                                <item>Subparagraph C. These agents so selected not to be in any
                                    sense accredited to the countries in which they are located. The
                                    military and naval men will of course not wear their uniforms.
                                    So far as possible the governments in the localities to which
                                    they are sent will be requested to give them assistance in the
                                    conduct of their work. These men would work in close cooperation
                                    with any relief agencies set up by <persName corresp="#p_HHC1"
                                        >Hoover</persName>.</item>
                                <item>Subparagraph D. To set up at some point in the Balkans, such
                                    as possibly Bucharest, a central office to which these agents
                                    can forward (probably for the President by courier only) their
                                    reports for transmission to the United States via Paris.</item>
                                <item>Subparagraph E. To establish at Paris for the assistance of
                                    the American delegation at the Peace Conference a “political
                                    intelligence section” under the direction of <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName> and such other persons as
                                    the State Department may send to help him to which would be
                                    forwarded all reports from these agents and from other agents of
                                    the Department of State already constituted in European
                                    countries.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Counterespionage organization.</p>
                        <p>I have conferred with General <persName>Nolan</persName>, the head of the
                            United States Military Intelligence in Europe, and I believe that this
                            work should be handed over to him and I suggest that a civil official of
                                <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0266"/>the Department of State who
                            has an appreciation of the duty of work desired done should be
                            associated with him.</p>
                        <p>3. The protection of the President and of the American delegation at the
                            Peace Conference and their [papers] and property.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that the most practical method of handling this problem is
                            through the use of the military authorities working under the direction
                            of General <persName>Nolan</persName> who is entirely familiar with the
                            peculiar conditions presented by this kind of work in France.</p>
                        <p>Almost all of the personnel to do the work outlined in paragraph 1 can be
                            obtained here in Europe. I should very much appreciate an expression of
                            your views respecting this important matter. If the plan as outlined is
                            promptly approved it can be put into operation before the Peace
                            Conference is called.</p>

                            reference to organization of our work unless you keep us confidentially

                            for handling particular branches of work of Peace Conference. You [<hi

                            the Committee on Public Information planned to do <pb n="198"

                            Can you tell me now whether the heads of such organizations as the “War

                            purposes of consultation. Please advise me the date when it is planned
                            that American staff for the Peace Conference will arrive. Please give

                                <persName corresp="#p_GHS1">Gibson</persName>’s assistance. Agents
                            will be despatched as soon as they can be chosen and approved by the
                            Department. <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName> will have

                            that <persName corresp="#p_GHS1">Gibson</persName> remain in Austria
                            after <persName corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName>’s return with

                            have someone there who can move about as required under instructions
                            from Paris. Do you not think it would be advisable for him to open the
                            Embassy Chancery so as to have place for section of documents and codes
                            and for installation of wireless outfit for rapid communication to

                        <p>232. From <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Grew</persName>. In view of the
                            delay in formulating an agreement among the Allies as to relief
                            policies, it has not yet been possible to send political intelligence
                            agents into the field accredited as representatives of Food
                            Administration and there is at present no certainty as to when this can
                            be arranged, although <persName corresp="#p_HHC1">Hoover</persName> will
                            again consider the question on his arrival London where he is now
                            conferring with the British authorities. Since diplomatic secretaries
                            are not available for this purpose, the only method I can suggest
                            without further delay in establishing our organization in the field, is
                            to obtain a release from the Army for such officers as we may select
                            [apparent omission] the approval of the Department and to send them
                            abroad in civilian clothes as representatives of the Department of State
                            and I request a decision on this point. In the meantime, we have made
                            further provisional arrangements with General <persName>Nolan</persName>
                            as regards organization, codes, etc. and with Colonel
                                <persName>Carty</persName> of the Signal Corps as regards
                            communication by wireless and we have a long list of Army officers
                            recommended by General <persName>Nolan</persName> and Colonel
                                <persName>Van Deman</persName> for this work in the field to be sent
                            abroad a few at a time. Our home office is now well organized and is
                            prepared on the arrival of the Commission to issue daily printed
                            bulletins containing digests of all political and economic intelligence
                            and press reports received from such sources as are available but we
                            shall of course be much handicapped by not having our own agents in the

                            from the press. The material will be in charge of assistants selected
                            for their ability to discard material as well as select it, so that
                            there may be gathered each day as small an amount as possible of
                            information of critical value to the Commission. The central office
                            would route this material to the different specialists, and would secure
                            the reactions of the specialists to the information obtained each day.
                            There would thus be concentrated <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0279"

                            and the reactions of all specialists and intelligence officers to it. It
                            would be from such material that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWC1"
                                >Bullitt</persName> would prepare the epitomes and comments for the
                            Commissioners which are now a part of his daily program.</p>
                        <p>The epitomes would be gathered in a special room, which would be open
                            only to the Commissioners and to the specialists, and to designated

                            Summaries. Those items of greatest importance would be starred on the
                            list of summaries, and the material on which the starred items was based
                            would be found in the special room. All other material would be kept in
                            classified form in the central office of the Division, where it would be
                            available should it be desired by any Commissioner or specialist.</p>
                        <p>According to the proposed plan the field agents in touch with the
                            Commission would be under the direction of the administrative officers
                            of the Section of Territorial, Economic, and Political Intelligence.
                            Their work in the field would be directed by this Section and their

                        <p>122. [From <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lansing</persName>.] After having
                            studied the question of sending agents into the field to obtain
                            political information, it seems to me <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210"
                                facs="0280"/>advisable that these men should go not as
                            representatives of the Department of State, which would give them a
                            diplomatic status and which might be misunderstood, but as agents of the
                            Commission itself. We have accordingly sent <persName corresp="#p_DEL1"
                                >Ellis Dresel</persName> into Germany to make a general survey of
                            the situation and to return to Paris to report to the Commission within

                            be selected before the party leaves Berne. Their purpose is to establish
                            a nucleus in Vienna, and they will be joined from time to time by other
                            men to be selected by the Commission who will be sent by <persName

                            Europe. The Commission will report the names of these men to you for
                            your information as soon as they are definitely selected. We already
                            have a large list of well qualified Army officers to draw from. Their
                            reports will be forwarded to the Department as well as to the
                            Commission. It is intended that Army officers shall go in civilian
                            clothes, permission first having been obtained through military channels
                            from the governments of enemy countries to which it is intended to send

                        <p>114. Secret for the President. I suggest that you send me a cable which I
                            can show to the heads of British and French Governments for the purpose
                            of obtaining from them the entire suspension of the present political
                            censorship upon American press despatches; military necessity can no
                            longer be invoked as a defense of the drastic censorship now being
                            exercised. There seems to be in my opinion no adequate reason why the
                            character of the political information supplied to the American people
                            should be dictated by the French and British Governments.</p>

                            President: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Please express to the French and British authorities our hope
                                    and expectation that they will entirely remove the present
                                    political censorship upon American press dispatches. Now that
                                    the argument of military necessity no longer obtains, there can
                                    be no good reason why the character of the political information
                                    supplied to our people should be determined by the British and
                                    French Governments and there is danger of a very serious
                                    revulsion of feeling on this side of the water, if such a
                                    censorship is continued. I hope that you will press the matter

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have been thinking a
                            great deal lately about the contact of the Commission with the public
                            through the press and particularly about the way in which the Commission
                            should deal with the newspaper men who have come over from the United
                            States. I have come to the conclusion that much the best way to handle
                            this matter is for you and the other Commissioners to hold a brief
                            meeting each day and invite the representatives of the press to come in
                            at each meeting for such interchange of information or suggestions as
                            may be thought necessary. This I am sure is preferable to any formal
                            plan or to any less definite arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I am also convinced that the preparation of all the press matter that is
                            to be issued from the Commission is a task calling for a particular sort
                            of experienced ability. I beg, therefore, that you and your fellow
                            Commissioners will agree to the appointment of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRS1">Ray Stannard Baker</persName> as your
                            representative in the performance of this duty. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRS1">Baker</persName> enjoys my confidence in a very
                            high degree and I have no hesitation in commending him to you as a man
                            of ability, vision and ideals. He has been over here for the better part
                            of a year, has established relationships which will be of the highest
                            value, and is particularly esteemed by the very class of persons to whom
                            it will be most advantageous to us to be properly interpreted in the
                            news that we have to issue. If you see no conclusive objection to this,
                            I would suggest that you request Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRS1"
                                >Baker</persName> to do us the very great service of acting in this
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p>I am writing in the same terms to the other members of the
                            Commission.</p>

                            following message to <persName>Tumulty</persName> from the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>The President has made the following arrangements with respect to the
                            handling of our newspaper publicity while he is in Europe: Maximilian
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> is to act as liaison
                            officer between the President and the newspaper men. He is to give out
                            all announcements respecting the plans of the President and the
                            Commission and all routine or special news items. Each morning at 10:30
                            the four members of the Commission, other than the President, are to
                            meet all the newspaper men in one room and at that time be questioned by
                            them. The President has designated <persName corresp="#p_BRS1">Ray
                                Stannard Baker</persName> to act with the newspaper men as the
                            interpreter of the American position at the Conference, to handle the
                            publicity of the Commission and to reflect the general spirit and
                            purposes of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CG1">Creel</persName> is to have charge of the
                            dissemination and spreading broadcast throughout the world [outside?]
                            the United States of all publicity given out by the Commission. It will
                            be the policy of the Commissioners to be very frank with the newspaper
                            men and to give them as much information as is practicable trusting to
                            their discretion in not publishing any information that would cause
                            trouble or that would be indiscreet in any way. It is impossible for us
                            over here to know whether newspaper men are respecting our confidence or
                            not. We have no way of telling whether they publish information which
                            was given them simply as “a steer” and not for publication. The
                            President wishes you to keep a close lookout on the American press and
                            to cable him freely exactly what the tone of the press is and whether
                            any particular papers are acting in an indiscreet way. He also wishes
                            you from time to time to make any suggestions that may occur to you to
                            assist us in our work with the newspaper men.</p>

                        <p>67. For the Secretary of State. The press telegrams from Paris are now
                            read with a great deal of interest and are the basis of discussion in
                            Congress and editorial comment. The stories are frequently contradictory
                            and sometimes obviously ridiculous. I take the liberty of suggesting
                            that the press representatives be warned of [the danger] of speculation
                            and if possible it might be desirable for someone in the mission to see
                            the reports that are sent particularly by the press associations, not
                            for the purpose of censorship, but to be in a position when desirable to
                            inform the Department that reports are untrue so they could be
                            contradicted.</p>
                        <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0286"/>
                        <p>The Associated Press under date of December 18th Paris, stated that the
                            American delegation had resolved to advocate sinking of the surrendered
                            warships. As a result of this story resolution was introduced in the
                            Senate protesting against this policy. Suggest Department be authorized
                            to contradict story if untrue.</p>
                        <p>I have warned press here against danger of accepting these press stories
                            as facts and the danger of creating irritation against the Allies as a
                            result of reported serious disagreements.</p>

                            <item>Mr. <persName>George Adam</persName>, the Paris correspondent of
                                the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, was in to see me today to
                                talk over the relationship of the British correspondents to the
                                American Commission. The same subject has been broached by other
                                British correspondents. They are very desirous of some opportunity
                                for meeting the Commissioners. They do not ask to come in with the
                                American correspondents at the morning sessions, but suggest an
                                opportunity once or twice in the week of meeting the Commissioners.
                                There will be from half a dozen to ten.</item>

                            <item>I would suggest that the Commission receive, at least once,
                                sometime this week, the British correspondents, immediately
                                following a morning meeting with the American correspondents. Mr.
                                    <persName>Adam</persName> says that the British Press
                                Association will nominate the men and that they will all be
                                noteworthy correspondents.</item>

                            <item>I have made inquiries in regard to what the British practice will
                                be. Mr. <persName>Adam</persName> says it is the intention of the
                                news department of the British Commission to treat all
                                correspondents alike, extending no <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217"
                                    facs="0287"/>special facilities to the British correspondents.
                                But it is not intended that any correspondent shall directly meet
                                members of the Commission. <persName>Sir George Riddell</persName>,
                                assisted by Mr. <persName>Mair</persName>, will be here on behalf of
                                the British Commission and will see correspondents. Access even for
                                British correspondents to the British Commissioners can only be had
                                by special appointment.</item>

                            <item>Whether the American Commission should receive the British
                                correspondents regularly unless the British Commissioners will
                                extend similar privileges to the American correspondents, is a
                                subject open to question. I believe, however, that it would be not
                                only an act of courtesy, but an expression of the democratic
                                American approach to this whole situation if the Commission would
                                receive the British correspondents at least once, and let them
                                present their own case.</item>

                                </hi>: I have, in accordance with our conversation of the other day,
                                taken up the matter of meetings of British correspondents with the
                                American Commissioners. The present morning conferences with
                                American newspaper men are not for the purpose of giving out news
                                but are merely give and take conversations to bring about a clearer
                                understanding between the Commission and the correspondents. It is
                                felt that if the Commissioners appoint meetings with the British
                                correspondents, they would also have to set a time for the French
                                and Italian correspondents, and there seems, moreover, to be no
                                arrangement by which the American correspondents will be given an
                                opportunity of meeting the British Commissioners.</p>
                            <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0288"/>
                            <p>It is our desire to cooperate fully with the British correspondents,
                                and to grant them every facility in our Press Department, and we
                                shall undertake to give any of the correspondents who come to us,
                                here, the fullest possible information at our disposal. I wish,
                                personally, to make the acquaintance of as many of the British
                                correspondents as possible.</p>

                            the initial meeting of the Peace Conference is to be an open one, so
                            that they can be present. They hope that the American Commissioners will
                            use their influence in this direction. Whatever may be the policy
                            afterwards in regard to Committee Conferences, a formal opening meeting
                            would help enormously in making our people feel that they were being
                            made a part of the proceedings: and would give the correspondents an
                            opportunity of seeing and hearing all the delegates from all of the
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>I presented Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRS1">Baker</persName>’s request to
                            the Commissioners at the meeting this morning, and Mr. <persName

                            meeting with the newspaper correspondents.</p>
                        <p>It did not seem practical to have the newspaper correspondents attend the
                            initial meeting of the Allied Delegates, if that is what was meant by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRS1">Baker</persName>’s request. It is
                            thought probable that provision would be made for the newspaper
                            correspondents to be present at the first formal meeting of the

                        <p>After consultation with the Plenipotentiaries, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRS1">Baker</persName> desires that members of the
                            Intelligence Section from time to time prepare memoranda for, and make
                            oral explanations to the press representatives, outlining facts and
                            problems in interesting regions, but without setting forth attitudes or
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>While this is not a job for which we have preference, we are willing to
                            undertake it, as desired, provided the Plenipotentiaries approve of our
                            doing so, notwithstanding the embarrassments to themselves that are
                            likely to be involved. I mean that in cabling this news, the pressmen
                            will inevitably interlard it with discussions and statements of policy,
                            which some of them will at times attribute to the plenipotentiaries,
                            entailing embarrassment and calling for denials or more serious
                            action.</p>
                        <p>It evidently is not for this section to decide whether that risk is to be
                            assumed.</p>

                        <p>Your November 15, 1 p.m. Department feels that it is not essential for
                            Brazil to be represented at the preliminary conferences. Please say to

                            considers it desirable that he should go to the peace conference and

                            understands that the peace conference will probably meet in the middle

                            desirable that Olyntho Magalhaens, Brazilian Minister at Paris, should
                            represent Brazil during the preliminary peace conferences as he has done
                            during previous ones. He will telegraph him to that effect. He will send
                            from here a Brazilian international lawyer to assist him.</p>
                        <p>Until President Alves comes to Rio de Janeiro, the Minister cannot confer
                            with him and his selection as Brazilian representative at the main

                            already considered the position of the countries that have severed

                        <p>124. Doctor Brum, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, has submitted
                            following confidential memorandum for report consideration.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Uruguay considered very worthy of attention the reason invoked by
                                the Allied Nations for limiting (or reducing) the number of
                                countries which are to attend the Peace Conference in as much as the
                                interests in debate being especially European, the presence of
                                representative of many American countries at the conference might
                                prejudice the interest of the Allied Powers. It must nevertheless be
                                taken into account that at the Peace Conference there will be
                                debated beforehand those mentioned political or financial matters
                                which distinctly affect the countries of America. Some of these as
                                for example Uruguay have special and direct questions to be settled
                                with Germany as a result of their attitude towards the European
                                conflict. It represents that the solution might be as follows:</p>
                            <p>Invite the countries which are in the situation of Uruguay to the
                                Peace Conference arranging that they shall intervene only in the
                                political or financial matters which affect America. In this manner
                                due provision is made for European views; and there is not inflicted
                                upon the countries of America solidary with the Allies, the rebuff
                                of doing without them, and according them the same treatment as to
                                those which remained neutral in the bravest [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >gravest</hi>] moments of the war.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>American Minister in Uruguay is of the opinion that Allied Governments
                            have been furnished with memorandum of similar nature. Diplomatic
                            representatives of Allied Governments in Montevideo have informed
                            Uruguayan Government that they are taking great interest in causing the
                            matter to be brought to the attention of their Governments.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad to be informed whether: 1, those Central and South
                            American countries which declared war on Germany are to be represented
                            at the Peace Conference; 2, those countries such as Uruguay and Peru
                            which broke relations with the German Government and turned over the
                            German ships in their ports to the United States Government are to be
                            represented in order that if the answer is in the affirmative it may
                            appear that they gained their representation through good offices of the
                            United States Government.</p>
                        <p>There is very strong sentiment even in those countries such as Uruguay
                            and Peru that they should be represented at the Peace Conference and
                            unless they are so represented they will feel aggrieved and consider

                            December 21, 8 p.m. Please inform Brazilian Ambassador [<hi

                            his difficulties and embarrassment, and that the American Commissioners
                            will be most happy to lend their good offices at the appropriate moment
                            with a view to arranging if possible for Brazil’s representation at the
                            Peace Conference. It would seem advisable for Brazil to send one or more
                            delegates provisionally to Paris, as has been done by China and
                            presumably by others of the less important allied countries. <persName

                            December 24, 5:00 p.m. The American Commission regards with sympathy the
                            desire of the South and Central American States which declared war on or
                            broke relations with Germany to be represented at the Peace Conference;
                            and while no assurances can be given in advance of the preliminary
                            meetings of the delegates of the great powers, the American Commission
                            will at the appropriate moment extend its good offices on behalf of its
                            Latin-American neighbors falling within the foregoing categories. If
                            your advice is asked, the advisability might be informally suggested to
                            them of sending one or more delegates to Paris to be on the spot in case
                            they are to be accorded representation at the Conference. You may assure
                            them of our friendly interest. <persName corresp="#p_LR1"

                        <p>228. [From <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lansing</persName>.] Your 42 of
                            December 30th. Commission concurs with view of Department that South
                            American Nations which declared war or severed diplomatic relations with
                            Germany should be represented at the Peace Conference. In this

                        <p>There seems to be a sympathetic feeling towards suggestion that neutral
                            nations be represented at any conference in which questions affecting

                        <p>178. For the Secretary of State from <persName corresp="#p_PFL1"
                                >Polk</persName>. I have heard from <persName corresp="#p_DGD1">da
                                Gama</persName>, both through <persName corresp="#p_MEV1"
                                >Morgan</persName> and the Brazilian Chargé here, that he is very
                            much disturbed over the report that Brazil would only be allowed two
                            delegates and that they would not be admitted until the general
                            conference. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_DGD1">da Gama</persName>’s
                            political reputation is at stake. Am taking the liberty of presenting
                            one or two arguments that occur to me that would make it desirable to
                            give Brazil most favored treatment in regard to delegates.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First: Brazil has already named four delegates. It would be
                                humiliating to have to cut the size of the delegation.</item>
                            <item>Second: Brazil is the only power in South America that really
                                declared war promptly and also was of material assistance in the war
                                by active cooperation, such as sending ships.</item>
                            <item>Third: Anything that has the appearance of a slight would of
                                course injure Brazil’s prestige in South America and would be a
                                source of gratification to countries such as Argentina and Chile
                                that are jealous of their affiliations with this Government and the
                                Allies.</item>
                            <item>Fourth: Brazil has stood loyally by us in practically every
                                question that has come up in South America. Therefore, it would seem
                                entitled to every consideration and would realize that this
                                Government was responsible for such recognition as it receives in
                                Paris.</item>
                            <item>Fifth: The fact that Brazil is the greatest power in South America
                                in the war would seem to entitle it to a fair representation on
                                account of its geographic position.</item>
                            <item>Sixth: The President elect of Brazil has never taken office owing
                                to ill health. There is a possibility of his resigning and a new
                                Cabinet coming in. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_DGD1">da

                        <p>1363. I am reliably informed that the Norwegian Government hopes that its
                            representatives will be enabled to participate in the forthcoming Peace
                            Conference in which the Norwegian representatives would advance the
                            views of this Government: (1) on all matters affecting the interest of
                            Norway, particularly with regard to the freedom of the seas; (2) on the
                            wish of Norway to join the League of Nations; (3) and on this
                            Government’s desire to assume sovereignty over Spitzbergen. The
                            foregoing three points are considered by the Norwegian Government to be
                            of paramount importance to Norway and will be strongly pressed.</p>
                        <p>This Government also hopes to receive compensation for Norwegian tonnage
                            lost during the war and that Germany will be obliged to indemnify for
                            the loss of life among Norwegian seamen.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations are understood to be going on with a view to obtaining
                            Swedish and Danish support for Norwegian claims in return for which
                            Norway will support the claim of Sweden to the Aaland Islands and
                            Denmark claim to Schleswig.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that formal representations along these lines will soon
                            be made by the Norwegian Government to the belligerent Governments.</p>

                            a note to the French Government proposing that an opportunity should be
                            given Denmark to participate in the discussion of the question regarding
                            the establishment of a League of Nations and of all other questions

                                    Paris to the French Government</hi>

                            <p>In the course of the World War it was proclaimed in the most diverse
                                quarters that one of the principal objects to be sought at the
                                conclusion of peace should be the founding of a League of Nations to
                                assure the establishment of an international rule of law and so lay
                                the bases of a lasting peace. It is obvious that this question is of
                                vital importance not only for the states which have taken part in
                                the war, but for all civilized states. On one hand, the founding of
                                a League of Nations would tend to influence the legal relations of
                                all states with each other; and on the other hand, it would
                                certainly have important consequences in the constitutional,
                                economic, and military organization of each country. For this reason
                                it is fundamentally important for all countries that their
                                Governments be admitted to participate, from the beginning, in the
                                deliberations on these questions. The Royal Government which, like
                                the whole Danish people, is animated by the keenest desire to see
                                the problem of a League of Nations brought to a satisfactory
                                solution, considers that it may be proper for it to take steps with
                                a view to obtaining an opportunity to take part in the discussion of
                                this problem as well as of every other question directly affecting
                                the interests of Denmark. In view of the fact that, as is generally
                                known, discussions on the procedures of the future Congress for the
                                conclusion of peace will be opened shortly at Paris, the Royal
                                Government has believed that it ought to apply in the matter to the
                                Government of the French Republic with the request that the
                                application be communicated to the other interested Governments.</p>

                                <persName>Nils Ihlen</persName>.</note> informed me that a copy of
                            the note had been forwarded to the Norwegian Minister at Washington, for
                            communication to the Department, and that similar representations had
                            been made by the other Scandinavian Governments.</p>
                        <p>In view of the information in my possession, as reported to the
                            Department in my despatch No. 1068, I sounded His Excellency as to the
                            detailed nature of this Government’s demands, but he was noncommittal in
                            his replies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ihlen</persName> stated that in his opinion it was most
                            important for the Foreign Ministers of the neutral countries to come
                            into personal contact with the Secretary of State of the United States,
                            and added that if an invitation to attend the Paris Conference were
                            extended to neutral Foreign Ministers he was sure such an invitation
                            would be accepted with pleasure.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency also expressed the desire that if neutral Foreign
                            Ministers were asked to attend the conference they be accompanied by the
                            American Chiefs of Missions in the respective countries, in which
                            connection I beg leave to confirm that the British Minister as well as
                            the Commercial and Naval Attachés of the British Legation here, and the
                            British representatives at Stockholm and Copenhagen have gone to
                            London.</p>
                        <p>My impression is that the foregoing statements of the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs represent the result of recent negotiations with the
                            Swedish and Danish Governments.</p>
                        <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0309"/>
                        <p>It seems to me that it would be an excellent idea for the Foreign
                            Ministers to meet in Paris and become acquainted with the
                            representatives of other nations and that it could but have the result
                            of strengthening and developing friendly international relations.</p>
                        <p>It might also be a good idea to ask the Chiefs of Missions to be present
                            at the conference in an advisory capacity, to discuss with the delegates
                            questions concerning the countries to which they are accredited, but I
                            would recommend that they be accompanied by a member of the War Trade
                            Board and the Naval and Military Attachés.</p>
                        <p>As I have already reported to the Department (see my despatches No. 1029
                            of October 29th and 1032 of November 1st last<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d258fn6">Neither printed.</note>), the idea of the
                            establishment of a League of Nations has been greeted with great
                            satisfaction in this country and the press and the people are unanimous
                            in giving expression to their enthusiasm as well as to the hope that
                            Norway may be allowed to participate in it. There is also great
                            satisfaction in political circles that the President is attending the
                            conference personally, as this country has great faith in his judgment
                            and it is felt that his presence will ensure the safeguarding of the
                            interests of small nations.</p>

                            Denmark, Norway, and Sweden jointly called on His Excellency the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic and delivered to him three

                        <p>The document states that the founding of a league intended to institute

                            Scandinavian Governments have applied to the Government of the Republic
                            asking it to communicate their request to the other Governments
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency M. <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Pichon</persName> answered
                            that in compliance with their wish he would make their step known to the
                            Governments which will be called upon to determine in the first instance
                            the procedure of the Peace Conference, namely, the United States,
                            England and Italy. He added in answer to an inquiry by the three
                            Scandinavian Ministers that in his judgment the question of the League
                            of Nations could not be decided without the advice of the neutral
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>Your November 16, 1 p.m. The Department was approached a few days ago by
                            an American of international reputation as to <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0312"/>whether it would be wise for him to
                            accept an appointment as a representative or advisor of China at the
                            Peace Conference. The Secretary submitted the question to the President
                            who stated, without qualification, that he considered it unwise, if not
                            improper, for an American to have official connection with any other
                            Government in connection with the negotiations for peace. In view of the
                            President’s decision I hope you will discourage the appointment of

                        <p>Referring to the Department’s telegram of November 18, 4 p.m. The Chinese
                            Government will assign British and Japanese presidential advisers as
                            counsellors to the Chinese delegation to the [Peace Conference?].
                                <persName>Willoughby</persName> too would go as adviser to the

                            expert assistance should be eliminated on this occasion which decision
                            would have to be explained to the Chinese Government.</p>

                            recently reported that <persName>King Hussein</persName> had expressed

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith
                            copy of a communication dated Nov. 23, 1918, received by the Legation
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Howard</persName> with
                            reference to Liberia’s desire to be represented at the peace
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>As reported in Legation’s cable of Dec. 5, 11 a.m., both Consul General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PFL1">Lyon</persName> and General Receiver
                                <persName>Worley</persName> cabled to the President of Liberia their
                            willingness to accept appointment as delegates to represent the Republic
                            at the peace conference. These cables caused the President to address
                            the note, copy of which is enclosed, to the Legation requesting it to
                            ascertain what views the Department held with reference to the matter of
                            Liberia’s desire to send representatives to the peace conference.</p>
                        <p>In conversation the President assured me that the Liberian Government did
                            not wish to take any action towards selecting or appointing delegates
                            until it had been advised definitely by the Department what to do. After
                            making this reservation, however, the President expressed himself as
                            willing to appoint a mixed commission composed of Americans and
                            Liberians to represent Liberia. Such a commission as he had in mind
                            would have not more than five members nor fewer than three. But in any
                            case he desired that the Chairman of the commission should be a Liberian
                            and that the majority of the members of the commission should be
                            Liberians. Under these propositions a commission of three or four
                            members would have one American member, and a commission of five members
                            would have two American members.</p>
                        <p>The President also stated that it would be entirely satisfactory to
                            Liberia for the Department to recommend for appointment the American
                            member or members and that the Commission would be instructed to act in
                            complete harmony with the delegates of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President went on further to say that the proposals he was advancing
                            were tentative and that he was disposed to await advice from the
                            Department before doing anything.</p>
                        <p>I asked him what Liberians he thought of appointing if it should develop
                            that the idea of Liberia sending a commission was deemed advisable. He
                            replied that he would probably select the following men: <persName>James
                                J. Dossen</persName>, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia;
                                <persName>C. D. B. King</persName>, Secretary of State, and
                                <persName>Edwin J. Barclay</persName>, <persName>Attorney</persName>
                            <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0320"/>General. … I am quite satisfied
                            that the President, if called upon to appoint Liberian delegates to the
                            peace conference, will choose the ablest men available.</p>
                        <p>In speaking of American members of the commission he intimated that
                            perhaps it might be possible for an official of the State Department
                            familiar with Liberia’s international questions to be designated for
                            appointment as a delegate. I of course could make no expression on this
                            suggestion, and in fact have refrained from making any statement about
                            any phase of this matter. I have simply informed the President that I
                            would promptly communicate his note and his views to the Department for
                            such action as may be appropriate. It is felt that the Legation can do
                            nothing in the premises without the Department’s specific
                            instructions.</p>

                                state of the great World War, we are of the opinion that at a very
                                early date the Allied Powers will appoint delegates to represent
                                them at the Peace Conference which is to follow.</p>
                            <p>Liberia is most desirous of being represented at this momentous
                                Conference where, it is believed, the future of the entire continent
                                of Africa will form a very important feature. It is highly necessary
                                that the delegates of the Liberian Government should be in complete
                                harmony with those of the Government of the United States, and for
                                this reason it is hoped that they may be associated in a very
                                intimate sense with them. I have, therefore, to respectfully request
                                you to be kind enough to place this matter before your Government
                                immediately for an expression.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: The negotiations between
                                the heads of the Governments and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs
                                of the Allied States being about to begin in Paris in order to
                                prepare the peace preliminaries, the undersigned has the honor to
                                address himself to Your Excellency in the hope that the Government
                                of Montenegro will be represented thereat.</p>
                            <p>It is within the knowledge of Your Excellency that the right of
                                Montenegro to take part in the Inter-Allied Conferences has been
                                acknowledged by all the Allied Governments.</p>
                            <p>However, at the last Versailles conference the Montenegrin delegates
                                were not mentioned, although our Government had requested in <pb
                                    n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0325"/>good time to be
                                represented. It was attempted to justify this omission on account of
                                the military character of the decisions to be taken at Versailles,
                                Montenegro having no army at the front. Our Government regretted
                                this exclusion, Montenegro being since many centuries essentially a
                                military state and nearly always at war with Turkey and Austria.
                                There is no need to add that Montenegro in these last wars, although
                                small, has dared to stand up against the forces of Austria and beat
                                them in several combats, and that it was only after four years of
                                struggle heroically supported that it succumbed for the cause of the
                                Allies, standing alone against three enemies. In spite of all its
                                sacrifices Montenegro, in the most glorious period of the war and in
                                the days of the armistice, had on the Eastern front and on the
                                Franco-Belgian front, some thousands of soldiers in the service of
                                the Allies in the Anglo-Canadian armies, in the French army (Foreign
                                Legion and Army of Macedonia) and in the aviation. These soldiers,
                                under the flags of the Allies, have shown themselves heroes and have
                                won the highest military decorations.</p>
                            <p>The Montenegrin Government had declared at the second Inter-Allied
                                Conference, which took place at Paris in December, 1917, (meeting of
                                the commissions), that it was ready, if its organization in France
                                were facilitated, to get together in a very short time, under the
                                French high command, a legion of soldiers for whose qualities it
                                offered every guarantee. Such a request had been presented at the
                                beginning of 1916 after the fall of Montenegro. Thousands of
                                Montenegrins in North and South America and in the other Allied and
                                neutral countries impatiently awaited the call to put themselves at
                                the sides of their brothers and Allies on the European fronts.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, history has shown the importance of the Montenegrin rock
                                in the central Adriatic region and in its relation to the other
                                interior regions. Montenegro therefore had every right to take a
                                place even at the military conference. Montenegro has been and will
                                continue always to be a devoted and faithful Ally of the Allied
                                Powers. The Royal Government therefore has the honor to address
                                itself to the Government of the United States with the assurance
                                that in the negotiations about to begin at Paris to prepare the
                                peace preliminaries the place which is its by right shall be kept
                                for it.</p>

                            getting a seat at the coming Peace Convention. The Shah, Cabinet and all

                            who will doubtless decide according to equity, expediency, special
                            position of each power interested and the general political situation.
                            As regards Persia, His Britannic Majesty’s Government will welcome
                            presence of official Persian representative at the place where said
                            congress will meet to be consulted if and when any question directly
                            affecting Persian rights and interests comes up for discussion.” British
                            Minister remarked to me yesterday that he believed matter would be
                            finally settled by allowing Persia representation at the Peace
                            Convention but that she would probably have no voice or vote on general
                            questions but only on matters affecting Persia. This would appear to be
                            fair and just.</p>
                        <p>I beg to point out that Persia’s grievance is greater than and differs
                            from the sufferings of other neutrals in that her independence and
                            sovereignty had been before the war repeatedly transgressed and
                            questioned and since the war, violated by Russia, Turkey, and Great
                            Britain; that the presence over her protest of three armies, viz,
                            Russian, Turkish, and British, part of which did immense damage,
                            pillaged, murdered and brought on famine, some of whom yet remain on her
                            soil, makes her case in a category by itself.</p>
                        <p>I beg to suggest that this is the time to settle the
                            twenty-five-century-old Persian question. Persia’s hope is in
                            America.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Now that the war has reached an end the
                            Persians are evincing great interest in the peace conference and all
                            parties are in accord in expressing the desire that Persia should be
                            represented there. They base their claim for such representation at a
                            conference which will presumably be formed of representatives of the
                            belligerent nations only on the ground that Persia, though neutral, has
                            nevertheless suffered heavily from the war, her territory having been
                            invaded by the armies of three belligerent powers and actual fighting
                            having occurred on her soil on many different occasions.</p>
                        <p>Persia’s desiderata are to have her independence and territorial
                            integrity recognized by an international conference of the great powers
                            and guarantees given that she will be allowed freely to develop
                            internally as she thinks best for the establishment of a strong
                            independent state that will no longer be a pawn in the international
                            game of the large imperial powers. Persia also desires indemnities for
                            the damage caused by foreign belligerent armies in her territory and
                            there are some Persian statesmen who even desire that Persia should be
                            made a perpetually neutral state by treaties between the great
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>For the realization of their hopes Persians of all parties are looking
                            more and more towards the United States for help. They would like to
                            have the support at the peace conference of a strong disinterested power
                            like the United States having no political interests in Persia, should
                            Persian representatives be admitted there. …</p>

                            herewith, for your Excellency’s prompt and kindly consideration, copies
                            of the translation of two cipher cablegrams, which I have received from
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs at Teheran.</p>
                        <p>As these messages clearly point out, the Imperial Persian Government is
                            appealing to the Government of the United States to recognize <pb
                                n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0328"/>their right of representation
                            at the Peace Conference with the right to vote, in order that the vast
                            losses inflicted upon Persia by the belligerent Powers, who occupied and
                            invaded the neutral territory of Persia, be indemnified and the
                            sovereignty and economic and political independence of Persia be secured
                            for all time upon the firm foundation of justice which it is the
                            unalterable purpose of your Government to embody in the Peace Treaty. My
                            Government are assured that your Excellency’s Government will clearly
                            see the justice of this request on the part of Persia.</p>
                        <p>In my recent cablegrams I had urged my Government to take prompt action
                            in naming their delegation to the Peace Conference giving it full
                            instruction to co-operate thoroughly and closely with the Government of
                            the United States and to support the American delegation with their vote
                            in realizing the great principles enunciated by the President of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>If the British Government continues to take the attitude mentioned in the
                            enclosed cablegrams, how could Persia be given a chance at the Peace
                            Conference to safeguard her future, and have a voice in matters
                            discussed at the Peace Conference, which will directly and definitely
                            concern her destiny as a sovereign nation?</p>
                        <p>May I also submit herein enclosed, an article by La Marquise de Fontenoy,
                            published in the New York Evening <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, under the

                            which reflects to a degree the views of certain representatives of the
                            old regime in Great Britain concerning British policy in Persia.</p>
                        <p>At this time when the United States of America is to insure the
                            independence and sovereignty of all nations of the world, it is the aim
                            of the sovereign state of Persia, with the help of America, to guard
                            herself against all direct and indirect attempt upon the part of Great
                            Britain or any other Power, to interfere with her independence and seek
                            to use her as their “sphere of influence.”</p>
                        <p>As the time, preceding the opening of the Peace Conference, is very
                            short, may I beg your Excellency for a prompt and favorable answer which
                            I may transmit to my Government.</p>

                            <p>Your Excellency’s last cables received. Necessary instructions will
                                be given. The thing that is immediate and important is this: <pb
                                    n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0329"/>as a result of conferences
                                and steps of the Persian Government regarding right of
                                representation at Peace Conference, I advise you as follows:</p>
                            <p>A note has been received from the British Minister to the effect that
                                the British Government on its own part is ready to receive the
                                empowered representative of Persia at the place where the Peace
                                Conference will be held so that he may give information on the
                                occasion when matters pertaining to Persia may be discussed.</p>
                            <p>It is evident that because of the great losses which, contrary to the
                                other neutral governments, the Government of Persia has suffered
                                during the war, it cannot imagine itself in the same position as the
                                other neutral powers. Moreover at the Peace Conference it is
                                possible that questions will be brought up in which the Persian
                                Government will be deeply concerned, and the Persian delegation must
                                defend the interests of Persia. Due to these considerations it is

                            <p>It is necessary that you follow up your former activities in this

                            <p>Through the cables gradually sent you, you are assuredly advised,
                                concerning the objects of the Imperial Persian Government in their
                                international policies.</p>
                            <p>After the recent events which indicated the termination of
                                hostilities the Government deemed it advisable to convene a meeting
                                of ministers, dignitaries, and notables of the capital, in order to
                                consult upon the aims and policies, of Persia and resolve upon a
                                definite plan. The above meeting, in the course of several sessions,
                                conferred and exchanged views, and voted their opinion as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>Although the Imperial Persian Government adopted the policy of
                                neutrality from the beginning of the war, and pursued it to the very
                                end, nevertheless the territory of Persia was made a theatre of the
                                war during the entire period of hostilities. Inasmuch as for <pb
                                    n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0330"/>this reason, Persia was
                                subjected to violence and hardships, and suffered vast material and
                                moral losses, the Government of Persia therefore request from the
                                sense of Justice and fairness of the Powers the carrying out of the
                                following articles:<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">In telegram No. 54,
                                    Nov. 25, 1918, 1 p.m., the Minister in Persia reported receipt
                                    of a note from the Persian Foreign Office giving the following
                                    eight points; he also reported that the Legation had requested a
                                    more precise statement regarding the eighth point. The substance
                                    of telegram No. 54 was repeated by the Department in telegram

                                        neutral powers are not admitted. This is because of the
                                        losses inflicted upon Persia and the conflict of the
                                        belligerents upon Persian territory.</item>

                            <p>You will see that these eight demands which the Imperial Government
                                makes are based upon and within the scope of the fourteen principles
                                and conditions outlined by President <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                    >Wilson</persName>, all of which have been accepted in principle
                                by all the Powers. And the Imperial Government, because of the
                                losses suffered during the war expects that the Government of the
                                United States of America, to which your Excellency is accredited,
                                may not refuse to assist it in realizing these demands.</p>
                            <p>You are instructed to immediately convey these propositions to the
                                authorities concerned, and not to fail in any action which is deemed
                                necessary to obtain the assistance of the United States Government,
                                and to advise me of result immediately.</p>
                            <p>I also convey for your own information the following point: The
                                British Legation declares that the British Government is willing
                                that the fully empowered delegation of Persia be received at the
                                place <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0331"/>where the Peace
                                Congress is to be held, in order that he may furnish information
                                whenever necessary, concerning matters relative to Persia.</p>
                            <p>It is evident that, in such a case, it is impossible for the Persian
                                delegation to defend its country’s interests; for at the Conference,
                                questions will be taken up in which the Persian Government is both
                                directly and indirectly interested.</p>
                            <p>The safeguarding of Persia’s interests is, therefore, dependent upon
                                the Persian delegation being a member of the Conference, and
                                possessing the right to vote.</p>
                            <p>A similar answer is given to the British Legation.</p>
                            <p>I expect of your Excellency also to take immediate action and advise
                                me of result.</p>

                            have today received a cablegram from the Persian Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs at Teheran, to the effect that the British Legation has informed
                            them that the British Government agrees with willingness that the
                            Persian Government should participate at the Peace Conference through a
                            duly accredited delegation, and that the British Government will <pb
                                n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0332"/>on its part assist Persia in
                            achieving this end, but that it would be necessary that the Persian
                            Government should make representations at the courts of the other Allied
                            Governments in order that all these governments would be unanimous in
                            aiding Persia to realize this object.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I have the honor to inform your Excellency that my
                            Government instruct me in the above cablegram to approach your
                            Government with the request that you will be good enough to assist
                            Persia upon this occasion, when the friendship and sympathy of the
                            United States of America will prove of great value in enabling Persia to
                            be represented at the Peace Conference with the right to vote, in order
                            that the many wrongs suffered by Persia during one whole century,
                            including those suffered during the period of the war, shall be righted,
                            and the economic and political independence and sovereignty of Persia as
                            well as her future prosperity be secured upon the foundation of justice
                            provided in the great principles of the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>I will be thankful if at your earliest convenience you will be good
                            enough to send a favorable answer to this note which I may telegraph to

                            states that the delegate of the Polish National Committee at Paris,
                            recognized by the Allies, has applied to him for permission to
                            participate in the peace conference when questions bearing upon Polish
                            affairs are taken up, and requesting to be informed as to the sentiment
                            of the United States government on the subject.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have the honor to say that as soon as the position of the
                            United States on this question is determined you will be promptly
                            informed.</p>

                        <p>6700. Following joint telegram from Allied Ministers at Jassy dated
                            Bucharest January 7th: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The President of the Council has summoned us this morning to
                                    inform us of the violent emotion which he felt upon receiving a
                                    telegram from Carnavon [?] according to which Belgium and Servia
                                    would alone be admitted to the Peace Conferences with the four
                                    great powers of the Entente. We have taken it upon ourselves to
                                    declare that such information cannot but be inaccurate. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BJJC1">Bratiano</persName> replied
                                    that the fact is that ‘Roumania is treated like a poor wretch
                                    deserving pity and not like an Ally who has a right to justice.’
                                    He repeated that up to the present time we had not been
                                    permitted to declare that the treaty of 1916 remains in full
                                    force. He confirmed that if Roumania does not receive
                                    satisfaction on this point his Government would have to
                                    withdraw. He gave us the following statement (see my telegrams
                                    making this declaration) [words missing] from which it is our
                                    duty to bring to the most serious attention of our Governments
                                    the following considerations: <list>
                                        <item>First, In circumstances which it is superfluous to
                                            recall, the Entente has not been in a position to
                                            fulfill her engagements undertaken towards Roumania
                                            under the Treaty of August 17th 1916. In the first place
                                            the Saloniki offensive that was to begin a week before
                                            the entrance into war of Roumania did not take place.
                                            Nevertheless Roumania exceeding her obligations, risked
                                            her all at the appointed date with absolute loyalty.
                                            Besides she kept up the fight after the complete falling
                                            down of Russia whose aid was promised her [words
                                            missing] the Entente and although the new Russian
                                            Government had declared war on Roumania the Allies
                                            having done nothing to prevent or smooth down the
                                            conflict.</item>
                                        <item>Two, [<hi rend="italic">Second</hi>,] It is absurd, as
                                            we have already pointed out, to assimilate the situation
                                            of Serbia with that of Roumania. First Serbia had war
                                            thrust on her whilst Roumania was drawn into it by us on
                                            the faith of the promises of the Entente. Then Serbia
                                            has ever been in touch with the Allies which had
                                            harbored her Government and her army while Roumania, on
                                            the contrary, finding herself in a total isolation
                                            between two foes and in such a state that it was
                                            absolutely impossible, as was recognized by all allied
                                            representatives, for her to withdraw her troops into
                                            Russia.</item>
                                        <item>Third, As to the Bucharest treaty which one might be
                                            tempted to invoke to declare our promises null and void,
                                            we recall that it never had any legal value considering
                                            that it was voted by <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
                                                facs="0336"/>an unconstitutional parliament; that it
                                            has never been sanctioned by the
                                                <persName>King</persName> nor ratified despite all
                                            the means of intimidation employed by the enemy and the
                                            sufferings resulting therefrom to the country.</item>
                                        <item>Fourth, This view point which is clear upon the
                                            evidence is of unanimous opinion. We must put our
                                            Governments on guard against personalities that have
                                            lost all touch with their country for many months and
                                            whose language is inspired by party spirit or by mental
                                            reservations of personal ambitions. Our Governments must
                                            realize that the question today is to know whether the
                                            Entente will maintain its influence in this country
                                            which by the very nature of things and in virtue of our
                                            principles will number tomorrow eighteen million
                                            inhabitants or will alienate it by what everybody here
                                            would consider revolting injustice and an act of evident
                                            bad faith. We confirm that in the present circumstances
                                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJJC1">Bratiano</persName>’s
                                            withdrawal would precipitate the country into anarchy
                                            whilst we are obliged to appeal to his aid to restore
                                            order in Russia.”</item>

                            January 17th 4 p.m. There was never any question regarding

                            approval she has been assigned two representatives.</p>

                            <p>The signing of the Armistice by German representatives has brought
                                the armed struggle to an end and a period of general settlement has
                                been initiated. With all the uncertainty, under conditions
                                prevailing, as to the forms of the forthcoming peace proceedings, a
                                new order of things and relations between people is to result which
                                will determine the future of nations for many years.</p>
                            <p>The interests of Russia in this prospective settlement are of a
                                character most important and vital: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>It is in the East, where the greatest changes in territorial
                                        and national adjustment are to take place, most of which
                                        either affect Russia directly or materially influence her
                                        future development.</p>
                                    <p>Russia’s role in the world struggle has made her a heavy
                                        partner to the great international arrangements of war
                                        finance and economics, the regularization and adjustment of
                                        which is imminent.</p>
                                    <p>The vast territories invaded, with their millions of
                                        inhabitants, have been subject to untold suffering,
                                        spoliation and reprisals.</p>
                                    <p>The Central Powers are holding nearly two million Russian
                                        prisoners of war.</p>

                                    <p>During the Bolsheviki period an ingenious net work of
                                        economic obligations had been imposed upon Russia by Germany
                                        for the purpose of peaceful conquest.</p>

                            <p>The sacrifices, which Russia contributed to the war, appear to
                                justify that no discrimination should be applied toward a people
                                unhappy enough to be the first victim of the social disease now
                                threatening the world. It would be incommensurate with the momentous
                                import of issues, which are to determine the fate of the country for
                                the next generations, to be guided by considerations due to
                                incidental and temporary disability. In order to be stable and
                                complete the settlement has to account with the just interests and
                                participation of Russia. Arrangements, which might be regarded in
                                the future as unfair to the Russian people, would carry the prospect
                                of trouble and disquietude.</p>
                            <p>Certain general principles might be formulated, which in a spirit of
                                fairness and justice would determine the treatment which Russia is
                                to receive in the peace proceedings: <list>

                            <p>In order to render justice to the Russian people and to safeguard
                                their interests in the future peace proceedings, Russia has to
                                receive proper representation. The mere supposition to the contrary
                                is inconceivable. With Russia’s voice unheard a wrong would
                                persist—a source of permanent ill-feeling. In order to meet the
                                imperative necessity of providing for a representation of Russia,
                                difficulties of a formal character, arising from the disabled state
                                of the country, should be overcome.</p>

                                formed in New York at the beginning of 1918, when it became evident
                                that the Bolsheviki groups in Russia were the tools of the German
                                Government and are leading the country to social and political
                                anarchy and national disintegration. The League is composed of
                                different political groups in America, of Social Democrats, Social
                                Revolutionists, Popular Socialists and Liberals, which means all the
                                political shades of Russia with the exception of the Monarchists and
                                the Bolsheviki. The programme of the League is the establishment of
                                a democratic republic in Russia and the convocation of the
                                Constitutional Assembly on the basis of universal, equal, direct and
                                secret suffrage. The League was active in shaping Russian and
                                American public opinion in this country through different
                                publications, through mass meetings, lectures, conferences in all
                                the greatest cities of America.</p>
                            <p>The Interparty League considers as its privileges and duty to present
                                to the American Government its wishes and desires in regard to the
                                relations of America and the Allies toward Russia, and the League is
                                fully convinced that it is expressing thereby the will of all those
                                political parties in Russia which are the leading forces in the
                                great work of establishing a free democratic Russia.</p>
                            <p>It is of great importance for the restoration and liberation of
                                Russia that the American Government should recognize the coalitional
                                Omsk Government which is a settled Government of a part of Russia
                                and the first successful and solid step to the establishment of an
                                orderly free government in all Russia.</p>
                            <p>It is imperative that Russia shall get a full representation at the
                                Peace Conference, as a free and independent country. America and all
                                the Allies can never forget or ignore the fact that the Russian
                                people and the Russian armies had sacrificed immeasurably in blood
                                and wealth during the first years of the war for the freedom of the
                                world and safety of civilization.</p>
                            <p>The repatriation of the Russian prisoners from the Central Powers to
                                Russia must be accomplished under the supervision of a body
                                representing the Russian Democracy.</p>
                            <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0340"/>
                            <p>It is the most solemn will of the Interparty League and undoubtedly
                                of all Russians and Russian-Americans that the Clause of the
                                Armistice according to which the German armies should remain
                                temporarily on Russian soil, as the guardians of order in Russia,
                                should be declared as void and annulled. Russia and the Russian
                                people cannot accept without protest the humiliation that German
                                armies shall become the police force of Russia and the protectors of
                                the population against internal struggles and excesses.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have received your
                            note of November 20 in which you ask if it is feasible to have Russia
                            represented at the peace table or to admit a part of her by recognizing
                            and receiving delegates from the Omsk Government.</p>
                        <p>The whole question is certainly difficult but perhaps not more so than we
                            may have to solve in other cases. To begin with, ought we not consider
                            that we have taken a lead in regard to Russia? We resisted extraordinary
                            pressure to sanction a purely military intervention; we have steadily
                            declined to recognize separate movements or governments. We have said we
                            wish to serve Russia, not to use her, and have expressed a constant
                            desire to help wherever we may find ourselves able to do so. To my mind,
                            we have defined conditions which we should not chance obscuring in the
                            later discussion of intricate problems of peace.</p>
                        <p>I confess I have been perplexed by the many complications. It is,
                            however, evident that if the associated governments undertake for
                            themselves to settle Russia’s affairs and judge the interests of the
                            Russian people from the Baltic to Vladivostok and from the Persian
                            frontier to Finland, the responsibility is heavy. I believe we must <pb
                                n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0341"/>devise a means to bridge the
                            difficulty and am confident that if we make the attempt in advance we
                            shall save much confusion later.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I would suggest we inform the French, British, Italians and
                            Japanese that we will use our best efforts to see to it that Russia’s
                            interests are safeguarded and that we propose to urge that Russian
                            questions be considered as parts of a whole and not as separate problems
                            resulting from what may prove, for the most part, temporary
                            disintegration. At the beginning of the war, no army excelled in spirit
                            that of Russia; no army to the same extent perforce replaced its lack of
                            artillery by the devotion of simple men. Russia played a part as a great
                            nation in staving off the early victory of Germany and to that extent
                            her people have earned a right to assistance and counsel in their
                            present attempts to establish control of their own affairs.</p>
                        <p>The second point I would suggest, would be a statement that only
                            delegates from a Constituent Assembly or from some general government of
                            Russia based on democratic principles will be admitted as signatories to
                            the peace treaty; that in the interim approved representatives from
                            existing elements of order in Russia will be welcomed to appear before
                            the conference and will be heard on all questions relating to their
                            affairs and where Russian interests may be concerned. A special section
                            of the conference would be charged exclusively with Russian affairs and
                            with the duty of ascertaining the wishes of the people of various parts
                            of Russia. In this way the full session of the conference will be able
                            to speak on Russian affairs not only with knowledge but also after a
                            sympathetic effort to obtain a basis of authority.</p>
                        <p>I believe a third point should be insisted upon, namely, that in
                            distinguishing between representatives of order and any others, we do
                            not at all oppose socialistic movements or governments as such but only
                            where they are definitely undemocratic and unrepresentative of the
                            majority will.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it seems to me vital that we should not only offer but carry out
                            immediate economic assistance wherever we can come in contact with
                            elements desiring to maintain democratic principles. In other words,
                            while we must set our faces sternly against anarchy and the class
                            tyranny and terror of Bolshevism, we must at the same time cut to the
                            root of the sore and relieve the misery and exhaustion which form such a
                            fertile soil for its rapid growth.</p>
                        <p>I have ventured to write you at such length only because it has proved
                            impossible to state the problem more briefly and I shall be grateful to
                            know what your judgment may be.</p>
                        <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                            <p>1585. Kindly transmit the following declaration of the Russian
                                Government to the French Government and through our Ambassadors and
                                Ministers in Europe to the Governments to whom they are accredited:
                                the war of four years against the German coalition has terminated by
                                the complete triumph of those who sought to guarantee the peoples
                                against violence and arbitrary power. Fate has not allowed Russia,
                                exhausted by the excessive burden of a long struggle, to continue to
                                fight in the ranks of the Allies until the joyful day of victory but
                                she celebrates this victory with the Allies and awaits the
                                beneficial results which will accrue therefrom for all the universe
                                and for the Russian people overwhelmed with suffering. Russia notes
                                with profound satisfaction that her supreme efforts for the common
                                cause as well as her innumerable and bloody sacrifices have not been
                                forgotten; the Allied Powers have forced Germany to cancel the
                                “Treaty of Brest”, they have obliged her to evacuate the Russian
                                territories and to cease the destruction of national property in
                                Russia. The Russian Government is happy to express the warm
                                sentiments of gratitude which this generous act of the Allies
                                awakens in the heart of the Russian people. Russia, who aspires to
                                the reunion of her territories separated from the Mother Country,
                                perceives in this act the hope of having her voice heard in the
                                peace negotiations and of collaborating in the organization of the
                                life of the peoples on new and unchangeable bases of a close and
                                honest friendship. The foundations of the reconstitution of Russia
                                are already laid. The Russian Government relying on the true
                                national sentiment which has just been awakened is working for the
                                reconstitution of the State having for its principles Liberty,
                                equality, and true democracy. The Russian Government knows that the
                                Allied Powers are guided in their acts by the high ideals of equity
                                and international solidarity, and will accept with gratitude their
                                assistance in her work for the regeneration of Russia; for Russia
                                cannot and must not remain <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0344"
                                />in the present state which threatens the civilized world with
                                further great commotions, and which might deprive for a long time
                                the peoples already exhausted with fatigue of the benefits of peace
                                and the victors of the fruit of their victory.</p>

                            prepared by the Conference of Russian Ambassadors and public men,
                            assembled at present in Paris, and is handed over to the respective
                            Governments. In its substantial part this document coincides with a <hi
                                rend="italic">Mémoire</hi> which I left with you.</p>
                        <p>Summarizing briefly, we are fully aware of the fact that a
                            plenipotentiary official representation of Russia is dependent upon the
                            recognition of a Government of Russia. Nevertheless we are firmly
                            convinced that the practical question of participation of Russians in
                            the Peace proceedings ought not to be deferred until such recognition
                            takes place. Obviously, before being officially vested with
                            plenipotentiary powers, no Representatives are in a position to sign
                            binding agreements. However, in the preliminary stage it is mainly the
                            general character of solutions which is going to be determined. More so,
                            the very platform of the future proceedings, on the broad and generous
                            principles brought forward by the United States, anticipates agreement
                            and understanding, and not outvoting or majorisation.</p>
                        <p>A proper participation of Russians would contribute to eliminate such
                            procedures and decisions which, in the future, might be regarded by the
                            Russian people as unjust and unfair. The very absence of Russians would
                            perpetuate in the future as a permanent source of ill-feeling.</p>
                        <p>That is why I was so emphatic in advocating the idea of admitting
                            Russians at the earliest stage of the future proceedings, when even in
                            the position of spokesmen, that is representatives who would be entitled
                            to discuss all forthcoming questions from the Russian point of view and
                            whose voice should be considered as Russian opinion.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to you the encouraging fact of unity of view of different
                            Russian factions, from moderate conservatives to national <pb n="275"
                                xml:id="pg_275" facs="0345"/>socialists, with respect to the Russian
                            international situation and her position in the coming settlement. It is
                            this unity of national opinion as well as the fact that the Assembly of
                            Ambassadors and public men now in Paris is connected with all the
                            centers of national movement in Russia, which happily contributes to the
                            possibility of favourable decisions.</p>

                            <p>Russia is entitled to participate at the Peace Conference on
                                conditions equal with the Allied Powers.</p>
                            <p>This is not only her privilege as of a nation which has so heavily
                                participated in the war, borne enormous sacrifices and thus largely
                                contributed to the final issues. The participation of Russia is as
                                well a matter of concern to the Allies &amp; to the whole world,
                                because a peace concluded with the exception of Russia and without
                                due consideration to her rights and her lawful interests, would not
                                secure the stability of the forthcoming settlement which has been
                                the chief aim of this war.</p>
                            <p>A Plenipotentiary Representation of Russia encounters difficulties
                                for the moment because there is not a Government in Russia
                                officially recognized by the Allies. However, the progress of the
                                consolidation of authority in Russia gives all reason to anticipate
                                that before the ratification of Peace Treaties the unification of
                                Russia will be a fact accomplished.</p>
                            <p>But even in the present preliminary phase of Peace proceedings, while
                                no binding decisions are as yet taken, but problems outlined and the
                                general character of solutions determined, the non-participation of
                                Russia would present inconveniences of not minor importance.</p>
                            <p>To meet these conditions, the Ambassadors of Russia in the Allied and
                                Cobelligerent countries, on the suggestion of the authorities at
                                Omsk, have assembled in Paris and with the collaboration of eminent
                                Russian public men, whose participation has met full approval of
                                Omsk, have proceeded to organize preparatory work for the
                                forthcoming Peace negotiations.</p>
                            <p>The Assembly of Russian Ambassadors and public men is prepared to
                                take part at once in the present phase of Peace proceedings by
                                designating for this purpose qualified Representatives.</p>

                            <p>Russia does not possess a Government officially recognized by the
                                Allies. The latter await the definitive result of the struggle which
                                is going on between the Bolshevist tyranny and the helpless majority
                                of the people who have been taken unawares. The Allies are faced
                                with the question: on which side is to be found the real Russia.
                                Nevertheless, the liberation of the Russian people is drawing near.
                                The tragic period of disintegration and dissolution is ended. It has
                                given way to the work of reconstituting the vital forces of the
                                people and the creation of a center of national unification. At the
                                present moment, such centers of regeneration have been formed in the
                                East, the North, and the South of Russia. The Governments which have
                                arisen in different parts of the country, for the moment isolated
                                from one another, are beginning to rally and to consolidate their
                                powers. They are all striving for the same goal of reviving Russia
                                and the sovereignty of the Russian people.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Omsk, which was set up before the others, is
                                laboring toward that object with an untiring energy and with success
                                in its efforts to group all the local governments about itself.
                                Having set as its goal the reconstitution of the Russian State, and
                                having solemnly given a pledge to grant to the Russian people, after
                                the reestablishment of order, the opportunity to express freely
                                their will and to determine their destiny, it has proclaimed itself
                                as the Government of all the Russias.</p>
                            <p>This Government has now existed for eight months. It is true that in
                                the interval changes have taken place within it, but this fact has
                                not had any influence whatever on its orientation and has not
                                checked the progress and consolidation of its power. The rich and
                                vast regions, which are included under its administration, are
                                purged of the Bolsheviks and its machinery of government has been
                                definitively <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0347"/>formed. Its
                                authority and its strength are growing from day to day. It has
                                created a well disciplined army. One hundred and thirty thousand
                                Russian soldiers, aided by the Allies, are successfully fighting on
                                a front of a thousand kilometres. The strength of this Government
                                and its capacity in operation are manifested by victories won over
                                the enemy.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the consolidation of power in Russia could advance even
                                more vigorously if the Allies were disposed to cooperate by the
                                official recognition of the Government of Omsk as the government of
                                all the Russias. This recognition would be for Russia one of the
                                most effective means of assistance. It would make easier her
                                liberation from the Bolshevist tyranny and would make possible the
                                free expression of her will.</p>

                            the Russian question is discussed at the Peace Conference, their
                            representatives should be permitted to be present. The telegram states
                            that the list of the representatives of the Omsk Government is being
                            prepared, and urges that the discussion of the Russian question should
                            be delayed until they are able to arrive at Paris. It is understood that
                            the situation in Russia and the policy of the Allies in regard thereto
                            will be discussed at an early meeting of the Conference, and no doubt a
                            decision will then be taken as to the recognition of the Omsk
                            Government. A decision in favour of recognition would grant the
                            principle of representation at the Conference, and the delegates would
                            thereby be placed on a different footing to their present one. His
                            Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris has been directed to inform the French
                            Government of the request from the Government of Omsk and of the views
                            of His Majesty’s Government in the matter.</p>

                            I have the honor to transmit the following note to Your Excellency:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Government of the Swiss Confederation at the moment of the
                                    termination of the war regards it as its right and duty not to
                                    stand aloof from the settlement of a certain number of questions
                                    in which Switzerland, like other States, is directly
                                    interested.</p>
                                <p>The Swiss people could not understand that those questions could
                                    be handled in a conference at which their Government was not
                                    represented, and rules set up without Switzerland’s cooperation
                                    could not possess with us the high value and absolute prestige
                                    with which we should like to see the international law of the
                                    future vested, with special regard to the institutions intended
                                    to secure a just and lasting peace. Furthermore, among the
                                    international questions which present themselves, there are some
                                    which have a direct and immediate bearing on Switzerland.</p>
                                <p>Under the circumstances, the Government of the Confederation has
                                    the honor to express a wish that its representatives be admitted
                                    into the conferences that are to be opened or at the very least
                                    those which will deal with topics in which Switzerland has
                                    interests of a general or private character.</p>

                            that inasmuch as questions of a general nature interesting not the
                            belligerents alone, are concerned, he thought it necessary to proceed in

                            the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant respecting the desire of
                            the Swiss Government that representatives of the Swiss Confederation be
                            admitted to take part in the coming Peace Conference.</p>
                        <p>In reply I beg to inform you that the attitude of this Government when
                            approached by neutral Governments with requests for participation in the
                            Peace Conference on matters of interests to them is to receive such
                            requests with sympathy. No definite position, however, will be taken
                            upon such requests until after the Secretary of State reaches Paris.</p>

                        <p>3. Can be no real difficulty about peace terms and interpretation of
                            fourteen points if the Entente statesmen will be perfectly frank with us
                            and have no selfish aims of their own which would in any case alienate
                            us from them altogether. It is the fourteen points that Germany has
                            accepted. England cannot dispense with our friendship in the future and
                            the other Allies cannot without our assistance get their rights as
                            against England. If it is the purpose of the Allied statesmen to nullify
                            my influence force the purpose boldly to the surface and let me speak of
                            it to all the world as I shall. League of nations underlies freedom of
                            the seas and every other part of peace programme so far as I am
                            concerned. I am ready to repudiate any selfish programme openly, but
                            assume that the Allies cannot honorably turn the present discussions
                            into a peace conference without me. Please do not use wireless.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I am enclosing, for your
                            consideration, a copy of a communication which I have just made to the
                            Department in the regular way in regard to the “freedom of the seas”. I
                            venture to think that the suggestions contained on pages 8 and 9 of the
                                enclosure<note n="1" xml:id="d314fn1">

                                portion beginning, “In conclusion I venture to suggest …”</note> may
                            point the way to some sort of an agreement with our friends here who are
                            very loath, as you have not failed to learn from other sources, to yield
                            anything of what they conceive to be their rights at sea. In a speech
                            which he delivered on December 1st <persName corresp="#p_WASR1">Admiral
                                Wemyss</persName>, the First Sea Lord, made the statement “that the
                            best guarantee which mankind had been able to advise [<hi rend="italic"
                                >devise</hi>?] <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0359"/>for the
                            peace of the world and the security of freedom was the power of the
                            British Navy”. As a matter of fact the British Navy has been running a
                            twentieth century war at sea with sixteenth century rules and
                            regulations and administrative ideas. I have a feeling that
                            consideration for this “freedom of the seas” matter should begin at the
                            starting point of all our difficulties, that is to say the shipment and
                            seizure of goods, and if we then worked upwards we should eventually
                            develop a system of procedure which would be reasonable, fair, and which
                            could be made acceptable to all interests.</p>

                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit, for the
                                information of the Department, the following observations in regard
                                to what is commonly called the “Freedom of the Seas” based upon four
                                years personal and constant contact with the various British
                                departments charged with actual responsibility under the blockade
                                regulations, and American claimants whose interests have been at
                                stake:</p>
                            <p>For present purposes I avoid all consideration of the doctrine that
                                free ships make free goods, the theory of the continuous voyage, and
                                the like, and I confine myself exclusively to facts of navigation
                                and commercial intercourse. The result of my observations is that
                                the shipper and owner of goods during the war now ended has been far
                                less concerned respecting nice distinctions of international law
                                than with the practical questions of administration. He could
                                accommodate himself to the requirements of the blockade and to the
                                theory of the continuous voyage, but he was constantly harassed by
                                uncertainty as regards administrative method, and if this method had
                                been less rigid, if it had been recognized not merely in theory but
                                in practice that the neutral shipper not only had certain rights,
                                but was entitled to a degree of consideration, we should have heard
                                much less than we did about infractions of international law.</p>
                            <p>I do not complain about the absence of it; indeed I rather imagine
                                that any country with an inflamed state of public opinion to reckon
                                with would find it difficult to maintain a certain sense of
                                proportion in the lower official circles unless those circles were
                                given definite metes and bounds by which their action must be
                                governed. In any <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0360"/>case, it
                                is a fact that whatever may have been the views of the higher
                                officials in this country during our years of neutrality, the people
                                who actually seized goods and who disposed of them, always proceeded
                                with the idea firmly fixed in their minds that one of the objects of
                                the war was to build up a prize fund to be distributed afterwards
                                among the men and officers of the Navy. It was difficult to find any
                                one of lower rank than a Cabinet officer who could realise that the
                                true purpose of the seizing of goods was exclusively to prevent aid
                                and comfort reaching the enemy; they were always obsessed with the
                                notion that there was a high patriotic purpose involved in building
                                up a prize fund. Obviously under these circumstances it was very
                                difficult for them to release goods which once came into their
                                possession.</p>
                            <p>The first great complaint of American shippers was that while
                                American goods were subjected to scrutiny, delay, and confiscation
                                if shipped to the neutral countries of Europe, the British shipper
                                was encouraged to establish relations with these countries, and, in
                                fact, carried on an enormously greater trade with them than ever
                                before in British history. Thus for example the exports from Great
                                Britain of cotton yarn grew as follows: <table rows="5" cols="6"

                            <p>While this successful British business was being carried on, British
                                Department officials found it extremely difficult to answer
                                legitimate inquiries on behalf of American traders with much more
                                than monosyllabic replies. Even the diplomatic correspondence of the
                                Department of State, while couched in the courteous language so
                                characteristic of the Foreign Office, was singularly lacking, when
                                particular cases were being examined, in explanations which tended
                                to make matters entirely clear, or in offering solutions which, in
                                the nature of things, could be acceptable. In general, the official
                                attitude until we came into the war was: “Come into our Prize Court,
                                make such claims there as you may be disposed to make, and await the
                                sentence which will be passed upon you”.</p>
                            <p>During the early days of the war ships were captured right and left,
                                and investigations followed. Ships were not detained because of any
                                specific complaint or knowledge with regard to a particular ship,
                                but systematically and upon the general ground that an eastbound
                                ship was necessarily an object of suspicion. To avoid delays to
                                vessels it was then proposed that ships leaving the United States
                                should be inspected by British agents while being loaded with a view
                                to giving them knowledge of material facts. The owners of the goods
                                paid heavy fees to have these surveys made yet after they had been
                                made the delays continued in the same way merely in order that the
                                conclusions of the British surveyor at the port of departure might
                                be verified at Kirkwall or somewhere else.</p>
                            <p>During the first two years of the war neutral shippers endeavored
                                over and over again to ascertain, in advance, whether contemplated
                                transactions would meet with British opposition, and were unable to
                                obtain any satisfaction. The cynical suggestion was constantly made
                                that they could ship their goods and could rely upon the fairness of
                                British methods. Usually the ships were detained and the goods were
                                either seized or long delayed, or, in many instances were allowed to
                                reach the intended destination on the signing of an agreement that
                                they would not be disposed of except with the consent of the Foreign
                                Office. In practice it was within the legal power of the British
                                Minister in Copenhagen, Stockholm or elsewhere to give the final
                                word, even after the discharge of American goods in warehouse in
                                those countries, <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0362"/>as to
                                whether or not they might be delivered to the intending
                                purchaser.</p>
                            <p>While matters were thus proceeding there was building up in the
                                United States an enormous body of opinion adverse to British methods
                                arising from innumerable transactions of the above general
                                types.</p>
                            <p>It was not until January, 1916, after I had had repeated
                                conversations with the various personages concerned, that the
                                Foreign Office agreed to put into effect what was called a system of
                                granting “Letters of Assurance”. Under this system the intending
                                shippers consulted the British authorities in the United States,
                                acquainting them with the commercial details, and if these details
                                were satisfactory they received a “Letter of Assurance” which gave
                                them reasonable security that the transaction could be completed
                                without Prize Court difficulties. Unfortunately, even then the
                                British Government refused to issue “Letters of Assurance” that were
                                absolutely final, and always reserved the right to review their own
                                decisions thus casting a considerable degree of doubt over the whole
                                system. However, without the slightest question, it eased up the
                                situation and had it been put into effect at the outbreak of the
                                war, would have prevented the development of those tense relations
                                between the two countries which we all felt up to the moment when
                                America entered the war.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, there was great complaint that while the British
                                Government set up the Netherlands Oversea Trust in Holland, and
                                effected similar arrangements in other neutral countries, requiring
                                that all goods sent to those countries should be consigned to the
                                Trust or its equivalent, it assumed no reciprocal responsibility to
                                hold goods harmless that were consigned in accordance with its
                                prescriptions. It was fair to assume that if the American shipper
                                consigned his goods precisely as indicated to him he should be
                                guaranteed against delay and confiscation, but nevertheless, time
                                after time, goods which had been consigned in accordance with the
                                British rule were detained, were brought from Holland to England to
                                be placed in the Prize Court, and even if eventually released and
                                allowed to be delivered to the purchaser after a long and
                                exasperating delay and a multiplication of costs, all of these costs
                                had to be borne by the owners of the goods rather than by the
                                Government which created them.</p>
                            <p>In cases where the British Government was clearly wrong in detaining
                                goods, and recognized that the goods were innocent, it invariably
                                declined to support the charges incident to its own operations. It
                                declined to assume any responsibility for delays visited upon ships,
                                declined compensation for demurrage, and, on the other hand, vessels
                                or goods which were delayed and brought into British ports were
                                required to pay local charges, pilotage, demurrage, and the like,
                                precisely as though they had sought the British port in the usual
                                course <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0363"/>of business. When
                                the Admiralty Marshal released goods against which no ultimate legal
                                complaint was lodged, a tax of £1 was collected for rendering this
                                service. These may seem small matters, but their cumulative effect
                                upon commercial opinion in neutral countries was very great
                                indeed.</p>
                            <p>I am quite convinced that administrative rules might have been
                                devised, and as respects the “Letters of Assurance” were devised
                                eventually, which had they been effective from the very beginning of
                                the war would have protected every substantial interest of the
                                British Government, and which, at the same time, within certain
                                limitations, would have enabled shippers to carry on business
                                without anxiety or loss, and it was largely the failure of those in
                                authority to realise this that created the feelings of
                                dissatisfaction which compelled the exchange of diplomatic Notes in
                                which the Department set forth so ably the American point of
                                view.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion I venture to suggest that any future rules of the sea
                                in time of war should set out in considerable detail administrative
                                directions fair alike to all concerned, and I offer the following
                                proposals for purposes of discussion: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Nations enforcing a blockade policy must openly state the
                                        terms on which their own merchants are allowed to do
                                        business with neutral nations adjacent to the blockaded
                                        Power, and must extend to noncombatant nations the privilege
                                        of trading on conditions equally favorable.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>Modern conditions make it entirely impossible to search
                                        vessels at sea, or to depend upon the evidence contained in
                                        the ship’s documents as proof of the destination and
                                        ownership of the goods. It is necessary for the
                                        ascertainment of material facts that ships should be
                                        searched in port, and there is no reason why this search
                                        should not be carried out at the port of departure rather
                                        than at a port of detention. Vessels whose owners do not
                                        desire to take advantage of an opportunity to be searched in
                                        the port of departure would naturally have to accept the
                                        consequences of this attitude.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>The importance of Prize Courts in any future war should be
                                        greatly reduced by legal recognition of “Letters of
                                        Assurance” which should be granted by a belligerent Power on
                                        the voluntary submission to its representatives of
                                        information respecting ownership and destination of goods
                                        about to be shipped. “Letters of Assurance” once granted
                                        should be final and conclusive. Refusals to grant “Letters
                                        of Assurance” should be subject to review by some competent
                                        international tribunal operated under equitable
                                        rules.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>When detentions are recognized as unjustified or as the
                                        result of error, the nations responsible should immediately
                                        pay compensation for demurrage and the like, and assume
                                        responsibility for their own acts in such manner as to admit
                                        of settlements without such interminable delays as now seem
                                        to be inseparable from claims against governments.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>The essence of my proposals is that decisions respecting the rights
                                of ships and goods in time of war shall, in general, be determined
                                    <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0364"/>before and not after
                                the voyage is begun or the delivery undertaken; that the losses of
                                legitimate traders shall be limited, in general, to deprivation of a
                                contemplated profit rather than condemnation of the property
                                involved; that when decisions are made by the administrative power
                                of a belligerent nation applicable to proposed voyages or commercial
                                transactions which are regarded by the Power whose nationals are
                                affected as in violation of neutral rights, there shall exist an
                                international Court of some kind to pass immediately upon an appeal
                                in order that the course of legitimate commerce may be impeded and
                                delayed as little as possible.</p>

                            apartments, I had a brief conversation with you on the subject of the
                            desirability of the prompt determination of the question of the extent
                            to which the American Commission, in its studies, is to be guided by
                            abstract principle and the extent to which such principle may properly
                            yield to considerations of expediency. I want to give you an
                            illustration of cases in point which I am constantly running into.</p>
                        <p>A change in an existing frontier may be demanded for either of two
                            general reasons: <list>

                                    of the interests of the peoples immediately concerned, to do
                                    so;</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>It is <hi rend="underline">expedient,</hi> from the point of
                                    view of the interests of the world at large, to do so.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall not discuss the question as to whether an expediency for the
                            whole world may not constitute a right for the world, even though
                            adverse to the immediate rights of the peoples concerned; because, as I
                            take it, our problem just now is to try to find out how these rights of
                            the peoples directly concerned can be reconciled with what is expedient
                            for the world.</p>
                        <p>I find that, for example, a frontier line for northern Italy can be drawn
                            in substantial accord with the Pact of London<note n="3"

                            Declarations,—practically, all Italians on one side and all aliens on
                            the other side.</p>

                        <p>I find that, following a similar line of racial cleavage, a Czechoslovak
                            State may be created with a practically homogeneous population of
                            8,500,000 people. A certain proportion of Germans and Magyars will be
                            included, but so small is the number at any one point that colors on the
                            map cannot be employed to distinguish them.</p>
                        <p>But, in the first case, a demand will be made for a much advanced
                            frontier on the ground that, in order to be prepared for the next war,
                            there must be a scientific, strategic frontier. This will include a
                            certain alien population radically antagonistic to the Italian one.</p>
                        <p>In the second case, a strategic frontier is demanded which will include
                            some 2,500,000 Germans and Magyars in compact bodies (besides some
                            600,000 Germans and 250,000 Magyars referred to above as scattered
                            through the Czecho-Slovak State).</p>
                        <p>Now, if we have to consider strategic frontiers as such, we are committed
                            to a mere revision of the Marquis of Queensbury rules for the European
                            prize-ring. And our work will be futile in our own life time. If we make
                            the probability of future wars our guiding principle we must remember
                            that any of the small states thus created, by amalgamating with some
                            other one may upset all of our strategic calculations.</p>
                        <p>The first object, and naturally so, of our European associates, is to
                            secure certain territorial adjustments. Our first and only object is to
                            secure certain principles.</p>
                        <p>If the territorial adjustment is to be the first matter considered, the
                            Americans will be at a great disadvantage. Such adjustments are a matter
                            of barter and trade. One of our associates says to the others, “I will
                            concede you this if you will concede me that.” We have nothing of that
                            sort to concede to any one. Therefore, at the very beginning, some of
                            our principles must come to the front as the only thing that we can
                            oppose to these transactions of barter and sale when they do not conform
                            to our sense of justice.</p>
                        <p>And so, in my judgment, some of our principles should and must come up
                            for consideration before anything else. It may mean a hard struggle, but
                            I am inclined to think that the struggle will be hopeless for us if we
                            allow everything else to be settled first.</p>
                        <p>To come back to what I intended to say: one of our principles or ideals
                            is a league of nations. Its object is to do all that is possible to
                            prevent war. Its necessity and justification are based on the fact that
                            not all nations can have scientific, strategic frontiers, such as
                            military men demand. Belgium has not and cannot have such a frontier. A
                            sort of league was formed to protect such frontiers as she has. That
                            league failed because it was not of the kind that we now have in
                            mind.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0366"/>
                        <p>If we believe that such a league can be formed and will be effective we
                            ought to secure the recognition of its principle at the outset. This
                            will smooth the path of negotiation. When one interest demands the
                            inclusion of an alien and racially antagonistic population, in order to
                            secure a strategic frontier, the reply will be that the league of
                            nations is the strategic frontier of every nation which has no other.
                            This would entirely meet the cases which I mentioned above by way of
                            illustration.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it seems to me that first of all the principles of the league
                            of nations and of rational disarmament must be admitted, or we are
                            committed to a re-weaving of the Penelope’s web that has been unravelled
                            by every Congress in Europe for the past 250 years.</p>
                        <p>What have we Americans to do with that?</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear <persName corresp="#p_BGTH1">General
                                    Bliss</persName>
                            </hi>: I am greatly obliged to you for your letter of yesterday giving
                            your views as to strategic and ethnological boundaries and the necessity
                            of asserting and establishing the general principle of the peace at the
                            very outset. With your opinion I am entirely in accord. We are face to
                            face with jealousies and selfishness which have drawn the map of Europe
                            in the past. It will be attempted again unless I am greatly mistaken and
                            it will be a struggle to prevent the victor’s desires from being the
                            guiding influences.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that the two principal governments, with which we are to
                            deal, have come to a working understanding and will endeavor to
                            frustrate any plan which will defeat their ambitions. We are peculiarly
                            strong because we have no territorial cravings, no selfish interests to
                            serve. If they could succeed in tarring us with that stick, they would
                            gain a decided advantage. I believe that it will be attempted by
                            tempting us with an African colony or starting a controversy in regard
                            to the Pacific islands. Possibly a protectorate over Armenia or
                            Palestine will be the bait. Whatever it is, I feel sure that we will
                            have to be on our guard, since nothing would be so pleasing to the
                            diplomats of those countries as to be able to point to the United States
                            and say that our unselfishness was a sham and we really wished
                            territorial acquisition. If they can do this our preeminence would be
                            lost and we would be unable to carry out our program.</p>
                        <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0367"/>
                        <p>You are certainly right, therefore, when you assert that the principles
                            of the peace are first of all to be settled. With those agreed to we can
                            discuss the details under proper limitations.</p>
                        <p>America’s unselfishness and devotion to justice must be maintained, and
                            we must not be led away into any discussion at the outset which will
                            impair the reputation which we have won.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I assume that the
                            delegations of other important nations to the Peace Conference will act
                            as units in the discussions and votes of the Conference. Certainly, the
                            only hope that the American delegation will have in securing the war
                            aims of its country lies in its following the French motto and being
                            “one and indivisible”.</p>
                        <p>May I ask what steps we are going to take in order to secure this
                            unanimity of understanding?</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that the moment the Peace Conference assembles the
                            question of terms with Germany will be taken up. The Allies, for
                            example, know exactly what they are going to ask in the way of
                            territorial cessions. Their demands will be immediately accompanied by
                            their reasons and arguments. Are we agreed that the Alsace-Lorraine of
                            1871 shall be ceded? or, the Alsace-Lorraine of 1814? or, Alsace
                            Lorraine extended by an economic boundary? or, Alsace Lorraine with the
                            boundaries of Marshal <persName corresp="#p_FF1">Foch</persName>? Are we
                            agreed on a principle with which we will meet a demand for the cession
                            of the entire left bank? How are we going to get the President’s views
                            or instructions on such questions?</p>
                        <p>These and many other questions stare us in the face, some as being
                            certain to be presented to us immediately on the opening of the Peace
                            Conference and the others following in due time. Is there no way by
                            which we can begin to formulate these questions now and come to a common
                            and cordial understanding as to the attitude that we are going to take?
                            Of course when we hear all arguments we may change our mind on various
                            points, but we must start out with the idea of changing the minds of
                            others to coincide with ours, which is exactly what they will do with
                            respect to us.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the other delegations arrive, we will be lunching and dining
                            with individual members of them and, if we do not know better than we
                            now do what each of us thinks on important subjects, we will be
                            expressing radically different views about the same thing.</p>

                                wholly null and void since the armistice with Germany, if not
                                independently of it. No government is recognized to exist in Russia

                            <p>The termination of German influence in the Far East would alone be
                                sufficient to warrant the inclusion of China, even if her position
                                did not require her assent to any agreement made respecting Far
                                Eastern affairs. Some difficulty may arise because of the uncertain
                                position of the Chinese Government and of the contest between the
                                North and South, and interim developments must be taken into account
                                for this reason.</p>

                            <p>The inclusion of Great Britain need be discussed only with reference
                                to Egypt.</p>
                            <p>The Egyptian Government seems to have broken relations with Germany
                                and Austria in 1914 by dismissing their diplomatic representatives.
                                The British Protectorate in Egypt has been recognized by France,
                                Belgium, Servia, Greece and Portugal. In the declaration of the
                                Protectorate, the British Government announced that “as regards
                                foreign relations, His Majesty’s Government deem it most consistent
                                with the new responsibilities assumed by Great Britain that the
                                relations between Your Highness’ Government and the Representatives
                                of Foreign Powers should henceforth be conducted through His
                                Majesty’s representative in Cairo.” It seems probable that in line
                                with this announcement, the British Government will deem itself
                                competent to represent Egypt in the execution of the Treaty of

                                these Powers might well be excluded from participation in the

                                clear that Roumania is still to be regarded as a belligerent, and
                                her vital interest in many of the important problems of the
                                settlement calls for her inclusion as a signatory to the Treaty of

                            </p>
                            <p>All of the Central Powers are interested in the big problems to be
                                covered in the settlement, and all should be represented. The
                                President’s Program seems to involve their participation in a
                                general Peace Conference. The Germany of the future may have little
                                interest in the particular arrangements affecting Turkish territory,
                                but Germany and Turkey will share with other states a common
                                interest in the public law of the future. While the United States is
                                not at war with Bulgaria and Turkey, the practical situation does
                                not preclude her joining in a general Treaty of Peace which deals
                                with the adjustment of their relations with Powers which are at war
                                with them.</p>
                            <p>The chief difficulty in dealing with the Central Powers and in
                                relying on their execution of the Treaty of Peace arises out of the
                                extreme uncertainty of the relative strength of political groups in
                                Germany and in what was formerly Austria-Hungary. To guard against
                                the possibility of having the participation of these Powers in the
                                execution of the Treaty of Peace later repudiated by some political
                                group which might consider itself not to have been represented, and
                                therefore not bound, it may be necessary to insist that the agents
                                who act for Germany and Austria and Hungary in signing the Treaty of
                                Peace, shall derive their authority directly from a constituent
                                assembly or from all political parties in each country at the time.
                                If complete anarchy should prevail in Germany, with no prospect of
                                its abatement, it might become necessary to execute treaties with
                                the other Central Powers, leaving the situation with Germany open
                                until order can be established.</p>

                            <p>It is now doubtful whether any Government exists in Austria, capable
                                of representing the Austrian people. The possibility of a complete
                                disappearance of Austria as an independent state is also to be
                                mentioned. If the Peace Conference should recognize the annexation
                                of German Austria by Germany, there would be no occasion for
                                Austria’s executing the Treaty of Peace as a signatory.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">2. Bavaria</p>
                            <p>Even though separatism in Germany should not proceed so far as to
                                lead to Bavaria’s complete independence of the rest of the Empire,
                                the independent role recently assumed by the Bavarian Government, as
                                well as its historic position in the Empire, seems to justify the
                                separate inclusion of Bavaria among the signatories. This would seem
                                also to be a desirable precaution to be taken against the
                                possibility of a future separatist movement in South Germany.
                                Developments may have to be awaited, before such a decision can be
                                reached.</p>

                            <p>Though it has recently undergone a radical change in form, the

                                Bulgarian people, and their adherence to any general regime in the
                                Balkans is essential.</p>

                            <p>At this time, no political group in Germany seems to have sufficient
                                political power or responsibility to represent the German people and
                                to bind them to the Treaty of Peace. Interim developments must be

                                the Karolyi Government of 2 November, 1918. It will doubtless be
                                recognized during the progress of the Peace Congress, and the

                            <p>The future independent existence of Luxemburg is so uncertain that no
                                definite statement can be made as to its being a signatory. Its
                                spokesmen are quite certain to be heard at the Peace Conference, but
                                if it is to be joined to some other state by action taken during the
                                Peace Conference, its consent might be manifested in some separate
                                way without its executing the Treaty of Peace. On the other hand, if
                                Luxemburg is to continue its independent existence, whether under
                                neutralization or not, it seems desirable that it should be a
                                signatory.</p>

                            <p>The situation in Persia is likely to be covered by provisions in the
                                Treaty of Peace. The independence of Persia was mentioned in the
                                Treaties which the Central Powers purported to conclude with Russia.
                                In May, 1918, Persia denounced the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907,
                                which had been previously denounced by the Bolshevik Russian
                                Government. It seems improbable that the independent status of
                                Persia will be discontinued by the Peace Conference, and her assent
                                to any provisions in the Treaty of Peace affecting her ought to be
                                manifested by her as a signatory.</p>

                                Presumably, their spokesmen will have been heard by the Conference,
                                though they may have had no formal representation. Some such states
                                may be placed under some sort of international tutelage which might
                                make it undesirable to give them the position of signatories.</p>
                            <p>Practical difficulties may arise in making sure that these new States
                                are represented in executing the Treaty of Peace in such a way that
                                their act will not be repudiated by rival political groups, and this
                                may have to be safeguarded by assurances that all responsible
                                political groups participate in the representation at the time of
                                signing.</p>

                                such incomplete success that it seems not inaccurate to put Albania
                                into this class of possible new States. Whether it will exist in the
                                future as a separate political entity, and whether it will be left
                                by the Peace Conference free from such outside control as will make
                                it a dependent government, are too uncertain for any statement to be

                                that their State will be recognized at the Peace Conference. Nor do

                            <p>The independence of Finland rests upon a very different practical and
                                historical basis from that of other separatist movements in Russia.
                                Finland’s independence has been recognized by several States, and
                                likely to be recognized also at the Peace Conference if the civil
                                war which has been raging in Finland is brought to an end. Even if
                                it is not represented at the Conference, the recognition of an
                                independent Finland would call for her inclusion as a signatory to
                                the Treaty of Peace because of her intimate interest in many
                                problems of the settlement.</p>

                            <p>It is very uncertain whether Iceland is independent. The recent
                                declaration of the “independence” of Iceland seems to have been
                                agreed to by the Danish Government, though an independent Iceland
                                has not been recognized by any other country. Iceland’s interest in
                                    <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0382"/>the problems to be
                                discussed at the Peace Conference is remote, and it seems probable
                                that the Conference will not be called upon to take any action which
                                would necessitate either the recognition of Iceland or her joining
                                in the execution of the Treaty of Peace as a signatory.</p>

                                signatories to the Treaty of Peace will arise out of the disturbed
                                political situation among the Poles. It may be necessary to insist
                                that the various political parties in Poland should take part in a
                                choice of the representatives who will bind the new State by
                                executing the Treaty of Peace.</p>

                            <p>The large number of nationalist groups which are now making claim to
                                political independence will doubtless ask a hearing at the Peace
                                Conference. Whether any new States will be recognized, as desired by
                                these respective groups, is so uncertain that it seems unnecessary
                                to have them included among possible signatories to the Treaty of
                                Peace.</p>
                            <p>In Russia, particularly, separatist movements have been numerous. The
                                Ukraine has succeeded in establishing some measure of independence,
                                and purported to deal independently at Brest-Litovsk. Georgia claims
                                an independent existence, which the Germans and Russians purported
                                to recognize in the agreements drawn up at Berlin, 27 August, 1918.
                                Other groups in the Caucasus have attempted to set up the Don
                                Republic, the Tartar Republic, the Republic of Turkestan, the
                                Republic of Kazan and the Yokatsk Republic. The independent
                                Moldavian Republic in Bessarabia purports to have been united with
                                Roumania. In Siberia, some groups are claiming independence also.
                                Lithuania, Courland, Livonia and Esthonia, all possessing some
                                degree of local autonomy, have an uncertain future.</p>
                            <p>In Turkey also separatism has been at work. The separate kingdom of
                                Hedjaz has to some extent been recognized by Great Britain, and
                                independence is claimed for Armenia. It is possible that an
                                independent State may be created in Palestine, but also possible
                                that all of the peoples redeemed from Turkish domination will desire
                                some connection with existing States.</p>
                            <p>In Austria the recent establishment of the so-called Silesian
                                Republic is to be mentioned.</p>
                            <p>It seems unlikely that any of these nationalist groups will be
                                included as signatories to the Treaty of Peace whatever plan is
                                adopted for their expression of their assent to provisions for their

                            <p>If the general Treaty of Peace is to include the agreements
                                establishing the international regime of the future, these important
                                neutrals ought to be admitted as signatories. It may be desirable to
                                devise a scheme by which they can act as signatories to certain
                                parts of the Treaty of Peace, those covering the League of Nations
                                and Declarations of Public Law. But the extent of the interest of
                                these neutrals is not so limited. Many of them are interested in the
                                payments to be exacted from the Central Powers, for they and their
                                    <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0384"/>nationals have suffered
                                damages as the result of the conduct of the war, particularly by
                                Germany. To this extent practically all of those named, except
                                perhaps Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, and Venezuela will be directly
                                interested in the provisions for the settlement of the war.</p>

                            <p>The place occupied by Argentine and Chile in Latin America is so
                                important that their adherence to the League of Nations is
                                essential, if it is to embrace Latin America. Both are interested in
                                German influence in South America, and in the problems arising out
                                of the interruption of their commercial relations with various

                            <p>Colombia has only the general interest of Latin American countries in

                            <p>With other Scandinavian countries, Denmark shares a vital interest in
                                many of the problems growing out of the settlement of the war, and
                                she has a special interest in the settlement of the future of

                            <p>As a neutral which has borne much of the inconvenience and burden of

                                Holland also has a special interest in whatever may be done in

                            <p>While Mexico has slight interest in the problems arising out of the
                                settlement of the war, it is perhaps to the interest of the United
                                States that any scheme for a League of Nations should have the
                                assent of Mexico.</p>

                            <p>Norway’s particular interest is in receiving payment for her shipping
                                which had been sunk during the war, and in the future of sea

                            <p>Spain has a special interest in the indemnity problems arising out of
                                the conduct of the war, as well as sharing with other States an
                                interest in the establishment of a League of Nations. Spain still
                                claims interest also in Morocco.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">10. Sweden</p>
                            <p>Sweden has a special interest in the Aland Islands, in Finland, and
                                in other territorial problems of the Baltic. She has a special

                                of the war, and she shares the general interest in the organization
                                of Europe.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">11. Switzerland</p>
                            <p>Military operations of various countries have cast heavy burdens on
                                Switzerland with reference to interned armies, which gives
                                Switzerland a special interest in the settlement of the war. As a
                                small state desiring to be assured of continued access to the sea,
                                and of protection against European neighbors, she is particularly
                                interested in the League of Nations.</p>

                            morning the first instalment of the attempt on our part, in accordance
                            with your instructions, to put flesh on the skeleton draft of a proposed
                            Treaty, previously submitted, which had the good fortune to meet with
                            your approval.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that the present articles deal with the Contracting
                            Powers divided into the three classes of belligerents, those which have,
                            and those which have not severed diplomatic relations with belligerents;
                            a suggestion as to the nature and extent of a preamble, an Article A,
                            which should probably be the first of the Treaty, ending the war,
                            restoring peace, and reestablishing peaceful relations between
                            contracting countries.</p>
                        <p>Under the caption of Article B you will note a draft of an Agreement for
                            a League of Nations, closing with some articles on open diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>Other tentative drafts calculated to put flesh upon the skeleton draft,
                            to use your own happy expression, will follow at short intervals, <pb
                                n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0387"/>and we hope that both those
                            submitted and those to follow will at least serve as a basis of
                            discussion.</p>

                                desires, therefore, to make clear that the employment of force to
                                create a ‘fait accompli’ may tend to raise rather than dispel doubts

                        <p>In my opinion, it would be preferable that any such statement should be a
                            joint declaration of the Allies or included in a speech of the
                            President’s rather than be made “ex cathedra” by the American Commission
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>The French military authorities in Budapest have recently indicated to
                            the Hungarians the boundaries which should be considered as a temporary
                            line to separate them from the Czecho-Slovaks. In case it is feasible to
                            draw such temporary lines of division in all disputed territories in
                            connection with the above statement, the force of the statement would be
                            greatly increased.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>In the skeleton draft of a Peace Treaty, drawn up by direction of the
                                American Commissioners to Negotiate Peace, the topics embraced under
                                Sub-heads IX and X, paragraph 2, appear to justify suggestions from
                                the undersigned. It is probable that these topics, as well as others
                                embraced in this skeleton draft, may be brought up for consideration
                                before the Peace Conference by the American Commissioners, even if
                                that must not occur as a matter of certainty. Should these topics be
                                actually taken under advisement by the Conference, it seems plain
                                that a definite project in respect to the same should be in some
                                respects mapped out in advance, and that this detailed work is a
                                legitimate task for the personnel designated to assist the
                                Commissioners in their larger work. Not knowing of any concrete
                                propositions under Sub-heads IX and X, and on the assumption that
                                such may not be in existence, the following suggestions are offered
                                for such consideration as may be deemed worth while.</p>
                            <p>Sub-head IX contains four topics under the caption: “Limitation of
                                Armaments and Budgets”, namely, (1) Military, (2) Naval, (3) Aerial,
                                (4) Submarine. It seems quite obvious that this whole subject of
                                “Limitation of Armaments and Budgets” is so interwoven with the
                                other question of a “League of Nations” and so dependent thereon
                                that no profitable treatment is possible until the larger subject,
                                upon which this one hangs, has taken shape and has been in some
                                definite manner agreed upon. I, therefore, pass by Sub-head IX to
                                Sub-head X, namely, “Hague Convention and other International <pb
                                    n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0397"/>Agreements”. Under this
                                sub-head two topics are listed, i. e., (1) Status, (2) Amendment. As
                                The Hague Convention and other similar agreements represent an
                                attempt at partial codification of international law, and as they
                                deal largely with the rules that come into active operation during
                                time of war, their present consideration with a view to revision and
                                re-enactment is well worth serious thought. It may be argued that
                                the rules of land and sea warfare and the rights and obligations of
                                neutrals during a state of war will be fundamentally affected by the
                                organization of a new agency such as the League of Nations to Insure
                                Peace. It seems plain, however, that ordinary forethought compels us
                                to recognize the possibility of future wars, no matter what may be
                                the outcome of the attempt to create a League of Nations, and to
                                take steps in the light of that forethought. International rules, as
                                they obtain in time of peace for the government of intercourse
                                during such times, suggest no pressing need of attention at the
                                hands of this great Peace Conference. On the other hand, we are just
                                emerging from the greatest war in the history of mankind where the
                                rights and obligations of neutrals and the rules of land and sea
                                warfare have undergone the most searching test in modern times. In
                                this war, not only have matters hitherto subjected to rule through
                                The Hague and similar conventions, and through the growth of
                                customary law, been put through the fire of experience, but agencies
                                practically unknown in former wars have been brought into play. The
                                use of poisonous gases, bombardment from aerial machines, and the
                                submarine are new agencies of great importance whose extensive use
                                began with the present war and in respect to which no authoritative
                                rules can be said to exist. In one way or another scarcely one of
                                the old rules remains unbroken and hence their revision has become a
                                matter of urgent necessity, a revision which would naturally include
                                rules to cover the employment of such new agencies as this war has
                                developed.</p>
                            <p>It may be said that the deliberate consideration of such a revision
                                as is indicated above would require a longer time than the Peace
                                Conference would probably have at its disposal and that therefore
                                the wisest course would be to postpone the matter until the Peace
                                Treaty is concluded and the world has settled back into a normal
                                state of intercourse. Such a course, it appears to me, would throw
                                away a vast fund of experience and an alert condition of public mind
                                in all civilized countries, which, taken together, make the present
                                hour extraordinarily advantageous for a full examination and
                                recasting of the rules of land and sea warfare and the rights and
                                obligations of neutrals. There are in Europe today men who have
                                worked on submarines and men who have been employed in every way for
                                their destruction; there are men who have directed the employment of
                                    <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0398"/>bombing aerial machines
                                as well as others who have actually conducted the bombardments, and
                                also men who have knowledge of the effects of this species of
                                warfare; similarly, there are men who have undergone life in prison
                                camps and others who have had charge of such camps; and so
                                throughout all the varied experiences on land and sea which this war
                                has given rise to at all seasons of the year and in many lands
                                scattered around the world. Whoever undertakes today the task of
                                revision suggested in this memorandum would have all this
                                experience, this fresh knowledge and this keen interest at his
                                disposal. The rules have been through the crucible of war and are
                                now plastic and ready for moulding into new and better shapes. But
                                if several years shall have elapsed, the members gathered at a new
                                Hague Convention will approach their task with much of this valuable
                                experience dissipated or grown cold, the rules reset and hardened in
                                their old forms and the public mind, turned into new channels, will
                                have a much lessened interest in this most important matter. Again,
                                if the time which shall elapse between the first meeting of the
                                great Peace Conference and the signing of its final agreements
                                should prove too short for a complete and satisfactory revision,
                                which would form a part or an appendix to the Treaty of Peace, the
                                work done in this direction would not be lost but would be a
                                valuable aid to any future conventions which may take up the subject
                                matter. For these reasons, I am convinced that the time is most
                                opportune for undertaking the task indicated above, and assuming
                                that this may be done, a procedure somewhat as follows is suggested
                                as one which might produce good results.</p>
                            <p>Let each of the Delegations of the great powers represented at this
                                Peace Conference appoint a committee with instructions to codify the
                                rules of warfare on land and sea and the rights and obligations of
                                neutrals in war times. Such a committee should be made up of a
                                carefully selected personnel representing men learned in
                                international law in all its aspects, and of Officers of the Army
                                and of the Navy, and should be sufficiently large to break up into
                                sub-committees, each of these to deal with the several branches into
                                which the whole subject matter may naturally divide. We should thus
                                have the matter considered simultaneously by committees representing
                                the United States, Great Britain, France, Japan and Italy. Their
                                completed work would, by each committee, be submitted to its proper
                                Peace Delegation, and the latter might then refer the several
                                schemes thus produced to a new committee, made up substantially upon
                                the lines of the original committees, except that upon this final
                                committee would be representatives of each of the Great Powers
                                concerned and the completed work of this composite committee would
                                be submitted to the Conference as a whole for adoption, rejection,
                                or modification, as might be well.</p>
                            <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0399"/>
                            <p>If it is objected that such a course in the time probably at the
                                disposal of the Peace Conference would result in an imperfect
                                agreement or code, it may be answered that much would be embodied
                                therein of future value and as no finality attaches to this any more
                                than to any other international agreement, the weak points could be
                                detected at leisure and future Hague Conferences could, in the
                                calmer atmosphere of peace, make such modifications as time and
                                reflection would seem to justify.</p>
                            <p>If these suggestions commend themselves at all it may be added that
                                no time should be lost in getting to work and that every means at
                                the disposal of each of the concerned powers should be placed at the
                                disposal of the several committees. Moreover, a like procedure upon
                                other subject matters might be profitable, always supposing that
                                satisfactory concrete projects have not already been evolved. For
                                example, where it appears as inevitable, or probable, that
                                boundaries as they existed before the outbreak of the war will have
                                to be changed, committees of experts might be formed to study the
                                just location of new boundaries taking into account the political,
                                historical, economical, strategical and ethnological factors of each
                                problem. And so of the League of Nations if, as yet, the American
                                Commissioner’s propositions have not been reduced to precise
                                terms.</p>

                                >Clemenceau</persName> called on me this afternoon. He said that he

                                >George</persName> had asked him to come over simply for
                            electioneering purposes. He said that he thought it most inopportune to
                            call a meeting of this sort on the eve of your departure for France. He
                            added that if Great Britain adopted during the conference a grasping
                            attitude, France would oppose it. France, he stated, would be always

                            meeting here last Saturday night was somewhat disorderly, and resolution
                            receiving most applause was one in favor of withdrawal of all allied

                                Davis</persName> in which he discussed situation of Italy; the
                            annual interest payment of Italy to Great Britain is now $100,000,000,
                            and to the United States $50,000,000, which in his opinion cannot be met
                            by Italy at least for some time except out of fresh loans. <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> said that position of
                            British Treasury will be that Great Britain will not participate
                            financially except to extent of supplies furnished by herself such as
                            textiles, and by her colonies, and that such participation would be
                            perhaps 20% of total values. Further regarding relief plan <persName
                                corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> said that some countries such as
                            Belgium would pay for supplies furnished, but as to others where payment
                            impossible he doubted legality of direct loans from United States,
                            particularly in such instances as Poland, and thought financing might be
                            done out of President’s fund. <persName corresp="#p_DNH1"
                                >Davis</persName> said attitude of British Treasury learned by him
                            from conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Keynes</persName>
                            would be that indemnities to be paid by Germany should be limited to
                            reasonable amounts. <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> belief
                            based on reports through Holland is that Germans believe in so large
                            indemnity being demanded that apathy and pessimism prevail and that
                            after examination and report he is preparing we should prevent excessive
                            exactions which would mean German economic slavery. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> opinion from some investigation
                            made by him of damage to home buildings in Northern France, not
                            including buildings or property of any other character, might be
                            $300,000,000. to not exceeding $500,000,000. <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335"
                                facs="0405"/>He thought tentative Belgium indemnity figure published
                            this morning of two hundred seventy million pounds would be somewhat of
                            a shock to French ideas. <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName>
                            has talked freely with <persName>Monnet</persName>

                                <persName>Jean Monnet</persName>, French financial expert.</note>
                            who <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> says is very close to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName> and represents
                            his views and <persName>Monnet</persName> says the French idea regarding
                            a League of Nations has as basis the idea that the security of France
                            against any attack should be guaranteed by Great Britain and the United
                            States; furthermore that any development by the United States of its
                            foreign trade before France has opportunity for trade preparation will
                            make us as well as the idea of League of Nations unpopular; that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName>’s attitude in
                            discussion with President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>
                            will be one of acquiescence in general principles of League of Nations,
                            but of continuous questioning as to details; and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CGEB1">Clemenceau</persName> will ask the President to
                            formulate economic and financial proposals in which the French are
                            particularly interested. <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName>
                            idea is that regarding financial and economic proposals it would be
                            great advantage to us if both Great Britain and France should be
                            required to formulate them in advance for consideration by the United
                            States. <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> mentioned that a
                            letter from <persName corresp="#p_LAB1">Bonar Law</persName> received
                            today stated that no further loans would be made by Great Britain to
                            France or Italy. In the former case because France could get along
                            without them, and the latter case, because Italy could get along with
                            last loan of fifty million pounds just made by Great Britain, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> thinks that this
                            attitude of Great Britain is taken for bargaining purposes and might be
                            relaxed later. <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> mentioned
                            enormous stock of coffee held in Genoa from which Italians proposed not
                            supplying even our needs with view of making Genoa greatest coffee
                            market in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Keynes</persName> of
                            British Treasury told <persName corresp="#p_DNH1">Davis</persName> that
                            he <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Keynes</persName> has prepared a complete
                            report of all financial data containing probable British proposals which
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Keynes</persName> will show to <persName

                            divisions. Percy I think represents British attitude in his view that
                            all detailed questions of settlement should be considered first, and
                            that questions such as League of Nations and international control could
                            only be adjusted when all details of settlement had been gone over to
                            the point of a draft treaty. I suggested to Percy as expressing my own
                            views that perhaps same procedure would not apply in case of preliminary
                            discussions between friends as would be necessary at Peace Conference in
                            the imposition of terms upon enemies and the suggestion of agreements to
                            neutrals. I further suggested to Percy the question of straits and asked
                            how assuming first that some form of international control was to be
                            adopted and assuming second that such international control was to be
                            under a League of Nations if established could questions of detail
                            regarding Constantinople be worked out before question of League of
                            Nations had been determined. To this Percy replied with other hypotheses
                            which I think indicate the present British ideas as Percy has been
                            working on nothing but League of Nations for some time past. Percy’s
                            hypotheses were first that the international control of straits was by a
                            mandatory of League of Nations, second that that mandatory was United
                            States, and third we as similar mandatory have charge of Macedonia. He
                            then elaborated possibility of agreement by the <pb n="337"
                                xml:id="pg_337" facs="0407"/>United States to accept such a trust
                            and thought that in this way if similar agreements were generally
                            reached the League of Nations would very largely have its functions
                            determined without any attempt to formulate general principles. He went
                            so far as to suggest that if the formulation of general principles were
                            attempted the Panama Canal would come in the same class as the Straits
                            to which I replied pleasantly as expressing my personal views that such
                            a grouping seemed hardly among the possibilities. I regard Percy’s
                            conversation as an effort to convey to me without stating them as such
                            some of the British ideas which have been formulated, and that his
                            Panama Canal suggestion was an attempt to show difficulties in the way
                            of idealistic principles of United States.</p>

                        <p>Labor element has some features of danger but tendency to Bolshevism is
                            not apparent; political feeling in England is running high, and among
                            the opposing leaders is bitter; a noticeable feature which must be taken
                            into account is the intense anti-German feeling of the women; the Labor
                            Party are giving thorough support to <persName>Henderson</persName>
                            <note n="11" xml:id="d328fn11">
                                <persName>Arthur E. Henderson</persName>, Secretary of the British

                            and <persName>Barnes</persName>
                            <note n="12" xml:id="d328fn12">

                                the British War Cabinet.</note> who is the only Labor leader staying
                            with the Coalition is regarded as mediocre. <persName>Dennis</persName>
                            guesses the Labor Party will get less than one hundred seats but says
                            that the agreements of the whips have resulted in favoring the
                            Conservatives even in places where Liberal sentiment predominates such
                            as Scotland; so that the chief single unit behind the Coalition in the
                            next Parliament will be a Conservative bloc, and the Liberal Party as
                            such will be largely destroyed. <persName>Dennis</persName> says that
                            British public opinion at the present time is in a condition of nerves
                            bordering almost on hysteria owing to the long strain of the war
                            followed by the relief at its end and the excitement of a general
                            election coming at the same time. <persName>Dennis</persName> had a talk
                            today with <persName>Steed</persName> foreign editor of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Times</hi> who told <persName>Dennis</persName> that
                            there was practically a deadlock between the French and British on the
                            one hand and the Italians on the other at the conferences, and that the
                            Italians had written a letter to <persName>Milner</persName>
                            <note n="13" xml:id="d328fn13">

                                <persName>Steed</persName> was going to see
                                <persName>Milner</persName> about tonight. From what
                                <persName>Dennis</persName> told me of his conversations with men in
                            the Foreign Office whom he knows I am convinced that a general if not a
                            complete report was made by the British Foreign Office subordinate
                            officials on the British program about last Friday for submission to
                            Cabinet which had a long meeting on Saturday.
                                <persName>Dennis</persName> said that air of
                                <persName>Tyrrell</persName> and other men at Foreign Office on last
                            Friday <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0408"/>was one of relief that
                            their work had been completed in the preparation of this report coupled
                            with some anxiety as to how their work would be received.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Dennis</persName> was present at Labor meeting which filled
                                <persName>Albert Hall</persName> last Saturday night with an
                            overflow which filled <persName>Albert Hall</persName> on Sunday night
                            and there was at these meetings two distinct tendencies first to
                            accomplish aims by orderly political methods and second perhaps equally
                            strong to accomplish aims by general strike, and that feeling in favor
                            of withdrawal of troops from Russia appears to be almost chief
                            sentimental aim partly from ignorance and partly from resentment of
                                <persName>Henderson</persName>’s treatment regarding Stockholm
                            conference. I recommend that you direct that report of
                                <persName>Dennis</persName> regarding English political situation

                            <persName corresp="#p_WSW1">Wiseman</persName> tonight has no
                            information as to reported Italian demand for German East Africa but he
                            saw <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> at four o’clock who
                            said that first reading of note regarding relief seemed to present
                            important questions and he would take it to meeting with French and
                            Italians as they were to present proposal regarding that situation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WSW1">Wiseman</persName> said relief matter
                            will now doubtless await President’s arrival and this was also view of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HEN1">Hurley</persName> who told me this
                            evening that President had cabled directing non-delivery of note to

                        <p>Regret that my cabling today has been delayed by difficulties in hotel

                            <persName>Tyrrell</persName> in conversation today intimated that
                            British claims for indemnity by Germany would not be very large saying
                            that Britain and America were more alike in this regard than any other
                            two Powers, and mentioned necessity of both countries seeing that claims
                            were just. Still <persName>Tyrrell</persName> seemed to think that just
                            claims would be larger than German ability to pay but was not very
                            definite about this.</p>
                        <p>Regarding questions of procedure he considers that those relating to
                            interallied conferences are the only ones now important and that
                            questions regarding procedure of the peace conference itself can be
                            considered later. He assented to the view expressed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSW1">Wiseman</persName> that proposed agenda for the
                            interallied conferences should be drawn up for submission to you in
                            order that same might if you approved be submitted to President.
                                <persName>Tyrrell</persName> said that the paragraph <pb n="339"
                                xml:id="pg_339" facs="0409"/>in yesterday’s communication to you
                            from British regarding the fixing after President’s arrival of the date
                            of his conferences with the Allies was due to the desire of the French
                            to have the President view the devastated regions in France before the
                            conferences commence. <persName>Tyrrell</persName>’s division of the
                            classes of subjects to be discussed was first reconstitution of the
                            world and second indemnities although he did not indicate any order of
                            discussion but his grouping would include under one heading all the
                            questions of every nature except indemnities.
                                <persName>Tyrrell</persName> wants to establish contact between the
                            various individuals connected with our delegation and with British who
                            have to do with the same subjects, for example he would like their man
                            working on Poland to be in contact with our expert on Poland, and so on
                            through the list, and he is to give me a complete statement of British
                            personnel with their assignments in order that I may discuss these
                            questions with you. Will have further conference on procedure with

                            following additional information. The resolution making conclusions of
                            conference subject to discussion with President was pressed through by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> in face of
                            considerable opposition and annoyance on the part of others. Later
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> agreed to appeal to
                            you to give assent to the two most urgent matters. Both of these
                            proposals are to set up purely informative commissions which I should
                            not think would bind any government to any particular policy. In the
                            matter of the Adriatic I am told that the position is really dangerous
                            and there may be a clash between Italian and Jugo-Slav forces unless we
                            take hold of the situation. If you have not already done so I would
                            venture to advise you to assent to these two proposals both on the
                            grounds of practical urgency and in order to avoid any feeling of
                            annoyance on the part of certain important persons which would not
                            improve their relations with the President. I have discussed this
                            question fully with <persName corresp="#p_MDH1">Miller</persName>.</p>

                            be necessary for the President to have his own program of subjects to be
                            discussed and of the order of discussion. I have this belief despite the
                            expressed assent of <persName>Tyrrell</persName> and
                                <persName>Crowe</persName> to the necessity of such a program but
                            this assent was coupled with implied postponement until after arrival of

                        <p>With respect to resolution taken at meeting December 2, 12 Noon, I am
                            advising the governments concerned: 1, that eliminating the word
                            “Indemnity” from resolution B the United States agrees; 2, that
                            resolution C should be discussed after your arrival. With these
                            exceptions I suggest that the United States agree to these resolutions.
                            With respect to resolutions taken at meeting December 2, 4 P.M., I have
                            discussed the naval and military features with <persName

                            resolutions. With respect to resolutions taken at meeting December 3, 11
                            A.M., I suggest that you authorize me to state that the United States
                            agrees to these resolutions. With respect to resolutions taken at
                            meeting December 3, 4 P.M., I have suggested to <persName>Lord

                        <p>8. In conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1"
                                >Clemenceau</persName> this morning he stated that it was his
                            purpose to work in harmony with the United States in all things. He
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Pichon</persName> who was present to be
                            a witness to the promise that he would never bring up any matter at the
                            Peace Conference that he had not first discussed with us, and the
                            inference was clear that if we disagreed he would yield to our wishes
                            and judgment.</p>
                        <p>He declared that it was not our financial and economic assistance that
                            France wanted as much as our moral approval. He thought we had opened a
                            new and more splendid ethical era and France wished to stand with us in
                            upholding it. He thought the United States and France were the only
                            nations willing to make an unselfish settlement.</p>
                        <p>He asked that this conversation and promise be held in confidence.</p>

                            powers which have taken actual part in the war. Exceptionally other
                            powers may be convened in so far as questions interesting them directly
                            may be made the subject of debates thereat and only in regard to such
                            questions.</p>

                        <p>B. The powers shall be exclusively represented at the Congress by
                            plenipotentiary delegates to the maximum number of three, the latter may
                            be accompanied by technical counsellors.</p>

                        <p>C. The order of precedence among the members of the Congress is the
                            French alphabetical order of the powers (rule consecrated by
                            custom).</p>

                            each day at the same hour. The members of the Congress undertake

                        <p>Personally I favor both French and English be declared official
                            languages.</p>

                            the initiative thereof; when not made out in French they shall be
                            accompanied by a translation; no proposition can be presented to the
                            Congress otherwise than by one of the plenipotentiaries and on behalf of
                            the power represented by him.</p>

                            technical explanations upon any particular question when such

                            presenting a report to the Congress and of proposing solutions.</p>

                            delicate problems. First of all, the belligerents, shall form part
                            thereof, properly speaking: France, Great Britain, Italy, United States,
                            Japan, Belgium, Servia, Greece, Portugal, Montenegro.</p>

                        <p>A place must also be reserved to the theoretical belligerents: China,
                            Brazil, South American states (Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa
                            Rica, Haiti, Honduras, which might be represented by the United States
                            to avoid crowding,) Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Then will come the question of the new States recognized by the Allied
                            Powers: Poland, Bohemia.</p>
                        <p>Some determination must also be taken in regard to our Allies who have
                            treated with the enemy (without our recognizing these treaties):
                            Roumania, Russia.</p>
                        <p>What form of representation shall we accept for the states in formation,

                            other neutral American states, (Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay, Ecuador—in a

                            with the settlement proper of the war will appoint as assistants one or
                            two representatives more particularly qualified to study the principles
                            of the league of nations, that is to say, the stipulations of general
                            public law which shall constitute the second great task of the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>The three general plenipotentiaries (in accordance with the precedents
                            mentioned herein above) might be for France: The Prime Minister, the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Generalissimo.</p>
                        <p>The necessity of defining the [<hi rend="italic">and</hi>] limiting the
                            delegations of the powers is imperative in order to avoid for instance
                            the individual representation claimed by the important English colonies
                            (a principle which cannot be allowed, for why should not a similar claim
                            be presented by each of the different States composing the federation of

                            have a representative, though Great Britain would maintain the majority

                        </p>
                        <p>Similarly to the Congress of Vienna, leading principles should be
                            proclaimed:</p>
                        <p>A. Right of peoples to decide their own destinies by free and secret vote
                            (combined with the principle of a certain homogeneousness of the states,
                            principally applicable to Bohemia, Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia, Luxemburg as
                            aforesaid.) In other regions, sectionings will have to be carried out in
                            view of the discordance between the administrative frontiers and the
                            limits of the peoples which they divide: A. Such is the case for the
                            Polish countries incorporated in Prussia or Austria, for the Lithuanian
                            countries incorporated in Prussia or Russia in Europe, for the countries
                            incorporated in the Ottoman Empire, on account of the confluence of the
                            ethnical and religious groups, and of the difficulty of applying the
                            criterion of equal and secret vote.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: Does not this also apply to
                            Alsace-Lorraine, the Russian provinces, &amp;c.?</p>
                        <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>B. Release from treaties concluded between them of such groups of states
                            which by the fact of their admission to the Congress shall waive their
                            right thereto: This principle is entirely in accordance with the ideas
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: This applies as I read it to all
                            agreements made prior to or during the war—Russia, Italy, Japan and
                            Great Britain in regard to Pacific Islands.</p>
                        <p>Such a declaration has the advantage of freeing the Allies from any
                            previous imperialist aims: the necessity of abolishing the agreements
                            with Russia (which would comprise the cession of Constantinople to that
                            power) would in itself [assure?] the adoption of such a measure.</p>
                        <p>As to Italy, should she not adhere thereto, it would be difficult to see
                            how she could be admitted into the discussion: having previously to her
                            entry into the war presented to the Allies minutely detailed conditions
                            for the advantages she desired to derive therefrom, she would only be
                            entitled to discuss the affairs of the others if she herself allowed
                            discussion upon her own extensions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: We must not forget the hostility and
                            jealousy between France and Italy, and that this is France’s plan.</p>
                        <p>Finally, this Congress, like all those which have preceded it, should
                            adopt a basis of discussion. It cannot, like the previous ones, lean
                            upon the stipulations of a treaty, inasmuch as hitherto the Powers have
                            only concluded armistices (with Bulgaria, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and
                            Germany, which cannot serve as a basis discussing a peace treaty.)</p>
                        <p>One single basis seems to exist at the present time: it is the solidary
                            decision of the Allies upon their war aims, formulated January 10th
                            1917, in answer to the question of President <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, but it is rather a program than basis of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>It would therefore seem indispensable that the Prime Ministers and the
                            Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the four great powers meet previously at
                            Versailles to settle between them the affairs which the Congress shall
                            have to deal with (that is to say, the preliminaries of peace) and the
                            order in which they shall be discussed as well as the condition of the
                            sittings of the Congress and its operations.</p>
                        <p>In a general way the questions to be discussed are segregated in two main
                            series: First, settlement proper of the war, second, elaboration of the
                            league of nations.</p>
                        <p>This distinction would limit to the parties really interested the
                            discussion of the essential and immediate questions to be settled and,
                            wards the interest of a large number of states to discuss the general

                        <p>It will be more convenient to consider the French Note in an arrangement
                            somewhat different from that therein adopted, and the subject matter
                            thereof in general, before proceeding to discuss the detailed
                            suggestions of the French Government.</p>
                        <p>The theoretical similarities between the coming Peace Congress and the
                            Congresses of Vienna, of Paris, and of Berlin, are to be viewed in the
                            light of the great differences in the practical state of affairs now
                            existing as compared with that existing at any of the previous periods
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The situation will be set out in detail in order to emphasize the limited
                            scope of the precedents of Vienna, of Paris, or of Berlin. In each of
                            those cases the negotiations were solely for the purpose of reconciling
                            the differences between well-known and established powers, and the chief
                            difficulties in procedure arose from the difference in strength and in
                            interest of the Powers in particular questions. It is true that at
                            Vienna relations of the German states were to be adjusted, and were
                            adjusted in the formation of the North German Confederation; but even
                            there the Powers were dealing with entities whose preexisting status,
                            although unsatisfactory, was not in doubt. At the present time the
                            problem of the Peace Congress, while it includes problems similar to
                            those of the previous conferences mentioned, includes also the bringing
                            of order out of chaos in practically all of Europe east of the Rhine,
                            and north of the Danube, as well as restoration and <pb n="355"
                                xml:id="pg_355" facs="0425"/>a new life in various other parts of
                            Europe and Asia, and beyond this the regulation of Africa for the
                            future. The conditions of some of these communities is such as to render
                            it impossible to say as regards millions of people whether any
                            government, even <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, exists, and if so, of
                            whom it is composed.</p>
                        <p>The Powers opposed to the Central Powers may be grouped in six classes: <list>
                                <label>
                                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</label>

                                    have taken no actual part in the fighting.</item>
                                <label>
                                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</label>
                                <item>Powers which have broken relations with Germany.</item>
                                <label>
                                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi>.</label>
                                <item>Russia and Roumania.</item>
                                <label>
                                    <hi rend="italic">f</hi>.</label>
                                <item>Invaded neutrals: Luxemburg and Persia.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The classification is based on the international pre-war situation and
                            status, and before alluding to subsequent complications, it is necessary
                            to make some observations on the various classes above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The first class is composed of Great Britain, France, Italy, the United
                            States, and Japan. But even in this class there is distinction, for
                            Japan is not primarily, or particularly, interested in many of the
                            general questions of Europe, although she is vitally interested in the
                            Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The second class comprises Belgium, Portugal, Serbia, Greece and
                            Montenegro. Here again the classification is not altogether
                            satisfactory, for Montenegro has been practically out of the war since
                            1915, and may now be regarded as bound up with Serbia, or, more properly
                            speaking, with the question of Jugo-Slavia.</p>
                        <p>The third group comprises China, Siam (mention of Siam is omitted in the
                            French Note), Liberia, Cuba, Haiti, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras,
                            Costa Rica, Panama and Brazil. The whole question of the Far East is
                            involved in the belligerency of China and Siam. The other states have a
                            negligible interest in the particular results of the war. It is
                            obviously of great importance to the United States that the
                            Latin-American Powers should receive the consideration which they
                            expect. It is, of course, true that Liberia, Cuba, Haiti and Panama, are
                            practically under the direction of the United States, and this might
                            also be said of Nicaragua, but this fact is hardly one which can by us
                            be emphasized according to the suggestions of the French Note, which
                            will be noticed in detail hereafter. One complication may be mentioned,
                            and that is that the United States does not recognize the existing
                            government of Costa Rica. Probably a participation with Costa Rica in a
                            peace conference, and certainly signature of a treaty to which Costa
                            Rica was a part, would be <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> recognition
                            of the Tinoco government.</p>
                        <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0426"/>
                        <p>Egypt and six other countries, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Salvador
                            and Santo Domingo, have broken relations with Germany. Of the
                            Latin-American countries mentioned, Uruguay, in particular, has done
                            what she could to further the interests of the United States, and,
                            indeed, has committed acts which Germany might very properly, if she had
                            so chosen, have regarded as acts of war. The French Note speaks of
                            countries in the third class as theoretical belligerents (<hi
                                rend="italic">Belligérants théoriques</hi>). Whatever may be the
                            European view, it cannot be the position of the United States that
                            countries such as Brazil, a belligerent, and Uruguay, not a belligerent,
                            have been concerned in the conflict merely theoretically.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing complications on the side of the Powers
                            opposed to Germany, the striking situation in Russia is one that compels
                            attention. At least two new states have arisen out of the territory
                            formerly Russian, namely Finland, which has been recognized by some of
                            the Powers, and Poland, which will become a full-fledged entity by the
                            action of the Peace Congress itself.</p>
                        <p>Detailed mention is unnecessary of the other separatist movements through
                            Russia, as their permanence, internationally speaking, must still be
                            regarded as doubtful, even in the case of the Ukraine. It is to be
                            observed in connection with the Russian situation that two treaties,
                            with various supplements, have been concluded between Finland and
                            Germany, and also two treaties between Finland and Austria-Hungary, and
                            that no mention of any of these treaties is made in either of the
                            agreements of armistice severally made by those two Powers with the
                            United States and the Allies.</p>
                        <p>Luxemburg and Persia have been mentioned for the sake of completeness, as
                            their interests will be required to be considered at the Congress.</p>
                        <p>On the side of the Central Powers the practical and technical situations
                            are at least equally confused. Turkey continues an existing government,
                            although doubtlessly greatly to be changed in extent and form, a change
                            involving the question of the Straits, which is of interest to the whole
                            commercial world. Bulgaria remains a separate entity, although she has
                            become a Republic. It appears that Austria-Hungary is already
                            dismembered, that Hungary is a separate state, and that German Austria
                            is attempting to be. The South Slav question may perhaps be regarded as
                            one pertaining to Italy and Serbia, but the Powers opposed to Germany
                            recognize that Bohemia is independent, and associated with them although
                            its territory forms part of Austria and of Hungary as they existed
                            before the war.</p>
                        <p>In Germany the actual situation is not sufficiently known to be
                            intelligently discussed. Reports of the existence of independent
                            governments are numerous, and how far the authority of the existing <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> government at Berlin extends, or how
                            long it will continue, <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0427"/>are
                            questions impossible of answer. The complexity of this situation is not
                            lessened by the reports of <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> hostilities
                            between Germany and the Poles in the neighborhood of Posen. The
                            technical situation as to the international status of Germany is one
                            which is perhaps even more uncertain than the actual situation. The
                            German Constitution is certainly not in operation, unless, perhaps, in
                            some provisional form existing in the absence of dissent; and even
                            whether the German <persName>Kaiser</persName> has, or has not,
                            definitely abdicated, is not known.</p>
                        <p>The task of the coming Peace Congress is one of such magnitude, and is
                            one so different from anything that has ever confronted the world
                            before, that precedents in procedure should be used with great caution,
                            in view of the actual and technical uncertainties to which allusion has
                            been made.</p>
                        <p>Departing from the arrangement under the headings of the French Note, the
                            points therein discussed will be considered under different titles:</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Preliminaries to the Peace Congress</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is an essential part of the American program that there shall be open
                            discussion at the Peace Congress between the representatives of the
                            Central Powers and of those opposed to them, of the conditions of peace,
                            and it is an essential prerequisite of that open discussion that a
                            complete agreement as to the peace terms should be reached among the
                            powers opposed to the Central Powers.</p>
                        <p>It is very properly pointed out in the French Note that the questions to
                            be discussed fall into two general classes, viz.: First, those relating
                            to the settlement of the war, strictly speaking, and, second, those
                            concerning international relations of the future, which are grouped in
                            the French Note around the question of the society of nations. In
                            respect to both groups of questions the preliminaries to the Peace
                            Congress are of the highest importance. Unity among the powers opposed
                            to the Central Powers is essential, and that unity can be reached by
                            discussion and agreement among them.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the particular questions growing out of the war and
                            necessarily involved in its termination, real agreement may be reached
                            at informal conferences in each case and discussion among the powers
                            respectively interested in particular questions; such agreement should
                            extend, not only to matters of principle, but to matters of detail, and
                            after the agreement as to matters of principle is reached, memoranda
                            embodying the agreement in full detail should be drawn up as a proposal
                            to be presented and supported at the Peace Congress for the approval not
                            only of the powers directly interested, but of all the powers opposed to
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>This method of procedure differs more in form than in substance from that
                            proposed in the French Note. Its theory would be that <pb n="358"
                                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0428"/>instead of preliminary discussion among
                            the four Great Powers, to which discussion other powers would, as the
                            case might requite, be invited, such discussion would, as to any
                            particular question, be among all the powers directly interested in that
                            question, among which would, in every case, be the four Great Powers.
                            That the representatives at these discussions should have the assistance
                            of technical advisors, as suggested in the French Note, is obviously
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>It is to be observed that this method of procedure would accord with the
                            approaching visit of the President to Europe, for the questions of
                            principle involved in any particular matter might thus be agreed upon
                            with his approval, leaving a detailed memorandum based upon those
                            principles to be drawn up in each case for general approval and
                            subsequent presentation at the Congress itself.</p>
                        <p>It may clarify this suggestion as to procedure to consider a specific
                            instance: the case of the restitution of Belgium. Discussion of this
                            subject would proceed between the representatives of Belgium and of the
                            Great Powers, Upon their agreement on matters of principle, a detailed
                            memorandum would be drawn up for the approval of those Powers, and for
                            the subsequent approval of the powers associated with them. This
                            memorandum would form the basis of discussion at the Peace Congress with
                            the representatives of the Central Powers.</p>
                        <p>In matters of a more general nature, which while peculiarly of interest
                            to certain powers, are of great interest to others, and of some interest
                            to all the world, a somewhat different procedure would be necessary.
                            Such a question is that of the future of Central Africa. In such a case
                            a preliminary and informal discussion among the Great Powers alone would
                            facilitate an agreement with the smaller powers directly interested,
                            such as Belgium and Portugal, and, subsequently, with the other powers
                            which are indirectly concerned.</p>
                        <p>A somewhat similar method is essential regarding the public law of the
                            future. As to these questions, which may be conveniently considered as
                            pertaining to a society of nations, a preliminary discussion among the
                            four Great Powers and Japan is obviously desirable, for it is essential
                            that these Powers should be in accord in any plan looking toward the
                            peace of the world in the future; and it is probable that any plan
                            approved by these five Powers would subsequently be approved and joined
                            in, not only by the other powers opposed to Germany, but by the neutral
                            powers whose assent would be asked at the Peace Congress itself.</p>
                        <p>The first step of all, however, in determining the procedure of the
                            preliminaries to the Congress is an informal conference as to such
                            procedure among the four Great Powers. More than one exchange of notes
                            on the subject would probably result in a greater delay than <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0429"/>is permitted by the time available;
                            furthermore, such preliminary conference in considering and determining
                            the questions of preliminary procedure might also consider and determine
                            the questions more directly relating to the procedure of the Peace
                            Congress itself, its date of meeting, the powers to be represented, the
                            number of delegates from each power, and other details which will be
                            subsequently mentioned.</p>

                                their willingness to make peace with the Government of Germany on
                                the terms of peace laid down in the President’s address to Congress
                                in January, 1918, and the principles of settlement enunciated in his
                                subsequent addresses. They must point out, however, that Clause 2,
                                relating to what is usually described as the freedom of the seas, is
                                open to various interpretations, some of which they could not
                                accept. They must, therefore, reserve to themselves complete freedom
                                on this subject when they enter the Peace Conference.</p>

                            be found, however, all of the subjects mentioned in the fourteen points
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>; to these are
                            added a few others, which it is unnecessary to consider in detail in
                            this memorandum. There are doubtless certain subjects of a comparatively
                            minor character which are not mentioned in the fourteen points of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>, which will
                            require consideration by the Peace Congress. The possible addition of
                            such subjects to those contained in the fourteen points of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName> would be a subject
                            proper for consideration by the representatives of the Great Powers in

                            particularly as it is very probable that suggestions of still other

                            interested. Possible illustrations are the questions of Spitsbergen, of
                            the Aaland Islands, and of the reduction of the Chinese Indemnity
                            growing out of the Boxer rebellion.</p>
                        <p>The French Note proposes a declaration by the Peace Congress as to the
                            rights of peoples to decide their own destinies; the difficulty, if not
                            the impossibility, of formulating any such declaration is shown in the
                            French statement itself, which admits that the right is to be combined
                            with the principle of a guaranty of the rights of minorities and is not
                            only subject to a certain homogeneity of state, but is wholly impossible
                            of application in certain regions. The principle as expressed by the
                            French Note is one which, if generally stated, might: be the genesis of
                            innumerable future disputes, and possible future conflicts in and out of
                            Europe. The disastrous effect of such vague generalities is illustrated
                            in the case of Russia, and a specious attempt to use such a principle to
                            justify their own wickedness was made by the Germans in the case of
                            Belgium.</p>
                        <p>It is to be supposed that any treaty engagements of the Allied Powers,
                            particularly those with Russia, and with Italy, made during <pb n="361"
                                xml:id="pg_361" facs="0431"/>the war, which may be inconsistent with
                            the principles enunciated by President <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, have been in fact, if not technically, abandoned
                            by the Allied Powers, in view of their announced agreement with those
                            principles above quoted; accordingly, the United States could not
                            consider, in advance, the theoretical possibility of such a supposed
                            position on the part of Italy, as is mentioned in the French Note.</p>
                        <p>The French Note suggests the desirability of a declaration of the
                            principle of the integrity of home and colonial territory possessed by
                            the Powers (meaning doubtless the Allied Powers), on August 1, 1914.
                            While the African colonies are mentioned in this connection in the
                            French Note, it would appear that the declaration would also have
                            reference to the question of Ireland. The point involved in the
                            suggestions of such a declaration is one of policy and discussion
                            thereof is deemed to be outside the scope of this memorandum.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>According to the views as to procedure, previously expressed, the
                            question of representation of powers and of states discussed in the
                            fourth point of the French Note would be determined at the preliminary
                            conferences outlined. It may, however, be proper to present some views
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>In the first instance the powers to be represented at the Peace Congress,
                            on the one side, should be those at war with Germany (aside from Costa
                            Rica and Montenegro). The principles enunciated by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>, as well as the interests of the
                            United States, require that the smaller states, even those not active
                            participants in the war, should participate in the Congress <hi
                                rend="italic">ab initio</hi>. Included among the states considered
                            to be at war with Germany would be Roumania, as her treaty of peace with
                            the Central Powers is now a nullity, and also Bohemia, in view of the
                            attitude taken toward the Czechoslovaks by the United States and the
                            Allied Powers, as well as the expressions of the former government of
                            Austria-Hungary, contained in the note to the United States dated
                            October 30th, 1918.<note n="12" xml:id="d339fn12">See note No. 5348,

                        <p>Costa Rica could not be admitted because the government of that country
                            is not recognized by the United States.</p>
                        <p>The position of Montenegro is anomalous, but it would seem more prudent
                            to consider Serbia as the sole representative of the south Slavs, at
                            least until developments in that region have progressed further.</p>
                        <p>Another member of the Congress would be Poland, whose future status as an
                            independent power has been assured by the United States and the Allied
                            Powers.</p>

                        <p>Finland will at some point be a necessary member of the Peace Congress,
                            as German influence over that country must be destroyed, and the
                            treaties between Finland and Germany, and between Finland and
                            Austria-Hungary annulled, although no mention is made of them in the
                            armistice agreements.</p>
                        <p>In view of the existing circumstances in Russia, and until a favorable
                            change therein, it would seem impracticable to admit formally to the
                            Peace Congress any representatives, either of Russia as a whole, or of
                            any of its nationalities which may have attempted to set up separate
                            governments. The suggestion in the French Note of an inter-allied
                            committee for the protection of Russian interests, which would be aided
                            by Russian advisers, seems feasible and worthy of adoption, subject, of
                            course, to future developments. In view of the recent declaration of the
                            Ukraine Republic favoring a federalized Russian state, such development
                            may take place before the Peace Congress meets.</p>
                        <p>Albania has not such an international status as to warrant admission to
                            the Peace Congress, but its interests should be protected by a committee
                            of the powers on which the United States should be represented.</p>
                        <p>It is to be pointed out that powers may be admitted to representation in
                            the Peace Congress during the course of the Congress itself, and that
                            the hope of such admission will be a strong inducement toward the
                            establishment of settled governments. Accordingly, in any case of doubt,
                            caution rather than haste is desirable.</p>
                        <p>The rights of Luxemburg and of Persia, both invaded by the Central
                            Powers, must be protected by membership in the Peace Congress.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, justice and the interests of the United States require that
                            the Latin-American countries which broke relations with Germany, and
                            which did, from a practical viewpoint, all that was in their power to
                            promote the interests of the United States during the war, should be
                            regarded as entitled to representation in the Peace Congress. To draw a
                            technical distinction which will exclude such a power as Uruguay from
                            participation in the settlement of the war, in which her whole support
                            has been given to the United States, would disregard substance and be
                            consistent only with formality.</p>
                        <p>Finally the Peace Congress in proceeding, as it will, to the discussion
                            of those questions involving the future public law of the world, will
                            become a congress, which after settling the matters directly arising
                            from the war, will admit the neutral powers of the world to
                            participation in its discussions of peace for the future. National
                            groups not forming states, such as the Armenians, the Jews in Palestine,
                            and the Arabs, would doubtless be received and heard through <pb n="363"
                                xml:id="pg_363" facs="0433"/>their representatives by Committees of
                            the Congress, but could not be admitted to the Congress as member
                            Powers.</p>
                        <p>The qualifications and limitations of representation of the British
                            dominions, which appears to be desired by the Government of Great
                            Britain, could doubtless be determined at the preliminary conferences,
                            upon the subject of procedure.</p>
                        <p>As to the representation of the Central Powers, the situation is in some
                            respects uncertain. Turkey and Bulgaria, and perhaps Hungary, are now in
                            a position to appoint plenipotentiaries. It seems very doubtful whether
                            even a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government exists in Austria,
                            outside of Bohemia. As to Germany the possibility of a dissolution of
                            the union of the twenty-five states which have formed the German
                            Confederation must be recognized. If the present reports of the program
                            for the election of a constituent assembly in Germany, on February 2nd,
                            1919, are well founded, a unified government in Germany, with a definite
                            constitution, will seem probable; but at present it is impossible to
                            speak definitely of the technical situation of the German government
                            from an international point of view.</p>

                            <item>The whole point is one of great difficulty. Doubtless no State
                                should or could be constrained to become a member of the Society of

                                to be no reason why agreement upon questions involved in the Society
                                of Nations should be defeated by the dissent of one or two minor

                                it is accordingly suggested that one of the rules of procedure might
                                provide that committees may be appointed from the plenipotentiaries
                                present, representing at least three Powers, to consider such

                                of the Congress. It might further be provided that technical
                                advisers not plenipotentiaries might sit as members of such

                            <p>The French Government, upon examination of the precedents of the
                                Congresses of Vienna 1814–1815, Paris 1856, and Berlin 1878, has
                                taken up the various problems raised by the determination of the
                                peace preliminaries and the establishment of the general peace
                                treaty by the Congress which is to meet at Versailles.</p>
                            <p>The arrival of President <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName>
                                in Paris in the middle of December will enable the four great powers
                                to agree among themselves <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0436"
                                />without any discussion with the enemy upon the conditions of the
                                peace preliminaries to be imposed severally on him.</p>
                            <p>The examination will first apply to Germany and Bulgaria, with which
                                it is to our interest to negotiate at once in order to promote on
                                the one hand the disunion of the countries which compose the first
                                named; and on the other hand, as to the second country, avoid the
                                dangerous Bulgarian intrigues at home and abroad.</p>
                            <p>The peace preliminaries with Germany will furthermore shape the way
                                for the settlement of the main territorial restorations:
                                Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, the Slav countries, Belgium, Luxemburg, the
                                cession of the German colonies, the full recognition of the
                                protectorates of France over Morocco and of England over Egypt, the
                                provisional acceptance of the Constitution of new independent states
                                made up of the territories of the former Russian and
                                Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as the conclusion of treaties
                                between the Allies and Bulgaria and on the subject of Turkey, the
                                abrogation of the Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest treaties, and of all
                                the previous conventions with Russia and Roumania.</p>
                            <p>The speedy establishment of peace preliminaries with Germany raises
                                the question of a future regime. Even now one may notice the
                                antagonism of the Centralist tendency, which was that of the
                                Hohenzollern Prussian Administration, the National Liberals and the
                                Socialists, to the Federalist tendency (represented by the dynasty
                                and administration of the secondary states and by the deputies to
                                the Reichstag). We are interested in favoring Federalism and
                                furnishing a basis for it by elections held under universal suffrage
                                and by promoting the manifestation of differences through the
                                clauses of the treaty. Indeed, we cannot negotiate except with a
                                Constituent Assembly freely elected by universal, secret, and direct
                                suffrage.</p>
                            <p>The peace preliminaries with Bulgaria will likewise define the main
                                lines of the respective territorial status of the Balkan
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>The question of peace preliminaries with the other two enemy powers
                                presents itself in a different aspect. With respect to
                                Austria-Hungary it is not even existent, since that power has
                                disappeared; it will then be within the province of Congress to
                                admit on an even basis the two new states that have already been
                                recognized: the Czecho-Slovaks and Poland, and to listen to the
                                claims of the Jugo-Slav state now forming. As for the country of the
                                Magyars (formerly Hungary, stripped of the Slovaks, Roumanians of
                                Transylvania, and Croatians), and Austria (German), the objections
                                of growing out of their interpretations suggest exclusion.</p>
                            <p>The same, of course, applies <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> to
                                Turkey whose complete reorganization, accompanied by intervention in
                                her internal regime (which on principle is barred with respect to
                                other states), is worthy <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0437"/>of
                                consideration. It seems preferable to leave to the Congress the
                                discussion of the fate of those nationalities, for if peace
                                preliminaries were signed with them, it would be tantamount to
                                pledging ourselves at once to maintain the Ottoman Empire, that is
                                to say, a rule which for a century has perpetrated its abuses,
                                crimes, and causes of discussion among the great civilized states.
                                Furthermore, where could the power authorized to ratify in the name
                                of Turkey be found? Is it not better that the Allies should
                                determine the fate of the territories lying within the former
                                Ottoman Empire without the encumbrance of negotiations with that
                                Empire?</p>
                            <p>After reaching an agreement as to the peace preliminaries, the
                                representatives of the Great Powers will have to come to an
                                agreement on the principles of the representation of the several
                                belligerent, neutral, and enemy states at the Peace Congress. They
                                will take up in succession the cases of the actual and theoretical
                                belligerents, the newly recognized states, and the states in
                                formation, the former Allies who have concluded treaties with the
                                enemy but whose treaties have not been recognized by us (Russia and
                                Roumania), the neutrals, and the enemies. Among the belligerents, it
                                will be proper to distinguish between the small and the great powers
                                in respect to the number of plenipotentiaries and of admission to
                                the sessions. The great victorious powers alone will attend all its
                                sessions, the small powers being called only to sessions designated
                                for their special affairs. As for the neutrals and states in
                                formation, they may be called when their own interests are at
                                stake.</p>
                            <p>The number of plenipotentiaries will be limited to avoid congestion
                                and confusion in the debates; the Great Powers may designate from
                                three to five plenipotentiaries, the small powers from one to two,
                                the neutral and forming states only one. As the decisions are to be
                                taken by a majority vote, and as the representation of a state is
                                but one unit, it is not necessary that any state should have as many
                                representatives as a power of the same category, as provided by the
                                precedents of the congresses of the nineteenth century: each state
                                may freely choose the number of its delegates within the limits
                                above cited.</p>
                            <p>It seems that the labors of the Congress should be divided into two
                                main series: The settlement of the war properly so-called, and the
                                organization of the Society of Nations. The examination of the
                                second question no doubt calls for the settlement of the first.
                                Furthermore, the settlement of the concrete questions should not be
                                confounded with the enforcement of the stipulation of general public
                                law. Besides, that distinction is made necessary by the fact that
                                the enemy has no right to discuss the terms that will be imposed
                                upon him by the victors, and that the neutrals will only be called
                                in exceptional <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0438"/>cases to
                                attend the sessions where the belligerents will fix the peace terms,
                                while all the peoples, whether belligerents, neutrals or enemies,
                                will be called to discuss and take part in the principle of the
                                Society of Nations.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand those principles of President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WW1">Woodrow Wilson</persName>’s which are not
                                sufficiently defined in their character to be taken as a basis for a
                                concrete settlement of the war, even if appealed to as they have
                                been admitted by the Allies, will resume their full strength in the
                                matter of the future settlement of public law, and this will remove
                                one of the difficulties that might obstruct the Allies.</p>
                            <p>The procedure of the Congress will also be determined at the
                                preliminary meetings in the second half of December: Election of the
                                President, appointment of the secretarial forces (charged with the
                                duties of drawing the protocols, filing the archives, preparing
                                daily communiqués, provide for the administrative organization of
                                the Congress and the regular operation of the services), written
                                motions read at the previous session discussed jointly (so as to
                                bring about an agreement on the principle and afterwards work out
                                the details), printing of the protocols, organization of a drafting
                                committee, etc.</p>

                                of May 30, 1814, at the Vienna Congress; the protocol signed at
                                Vienna on February 1, 1854, at the Paris Congress; the treaty of San
                                Stefano signed March 3, 1878, at the Berlin Congress), had served as
                                a basis while the Congress of 1919 has no fixed basis before it:
                                indeed neither the four armistices signed with Bulgaria,
                                Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Germany, nor the answer of the Allies of

                            <p>It may be remarked that a certain number of the questions that are
                                raised have to be settled directly amongst the great powers without
                                calling upon any committee to discuss them; this applies to colonial
                                affairs which essentially concern England and France. It also
                                applies to indemnities, for outside of the torpedoing from which the
                                British fleet mainly suffered, Belgium and France alone are entitled
                                to indemnities on account of the systematic devastation suffered by
                                them. (The states which have become independent and those which have
                                secured considerable territorial enlargement would have but a slight
                                claim to indemnities.) It also applies to economic and financial
                                stipulations, the amount of which will be determined by the great
                                powers but the mode of payment of which alone will be discussed by
                                the peace treaty.</p>
                            <p>The Congress finally could place itself as has sometimes been done in
                                the past under the invocation of some of the great principles
                                leading to justice, morals and liberty, which would be proclaimed at
                                its very opening and even before fixing the procedure (concerning
                                which an unofficial agreement only would have been reached): right
                                of self determination of the peoples, right of the minorities,
                                suspension of all previous special agreements arrived at by some of
                                the Allies with a view to the fullest freedom of examination by the
                                Congress, declaration that the home country and colonial territory
                                held by the Allies on August 1, 1914, shall not be touched, solemn
                                repudiation of all the violations <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371"
                                    facs="0441"/>of international law and of humane principles, and
                                disqualification of enemy delegates who have signed violated
                                instruments or are personally guilty of violations of the law of
                                nations or of the crimes against humanity.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing sums up the plan of study and the principles suggested
                                by the French Government.</p>

                            the 7th instant by the Counsellor of the French Embassy, Monsieur

                            <p>Several days ago hearing incidentally that some “Notes on the
                                Indemnity” had been left at the Foreign Office by the French
                                Ambassador, I made informal enquiries of friends in the French
                                Embassy Sis to whether it would be possible for me to be furnished
                                with a copy thereof or their substance. The next day the Counsellor
                                of the Embassy asked me to come there, said that he would have a
                                copy made, explaining that the “Notes” or Project was given to the
                                Foreign Office informally, and extra-officially.</p>
                            <p>To-day the Counsellor, M. <persName>de Fleuriau</persName>, came to
                                see me and left with me the paper, herewith attached. He
                                re-emphasized the informal <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0442"
                                />character of this Project and added that it had been devised and
                                drawn up by M. Cambon and himself and was therefore merely their own
                                plan. My own opinion, however, is that this document has the
                                approval of the French Foreign Office and is a feeler or “Ballon
                                d’essai” launched in this manner to prepare the ground in advance of
                                the Peace Conference.</p>
                            <p>M. <persName>de Fleuriau</persName> explained that various reasons
                                impelled M. Cambon and himself to the belief that a Preliminary
                                Peace should be concluded without delay and thus terminate the
                                present anomalous period of neither war nor peace. The Germans are
                                clearly not able to fulfill the terms of the Armistice within the
                                time limit, and on the eixteenth [<hi rend="italic"
                                >eighteenth?</hi>] of this month the Armistice would therefore have
                                to be extended. Before all conditions could be carried out it would
                                probably have to be extended again. Owing to the unforeseen length
                                of the Armistice and the disadvantages to them the Germans would
                                have good grounds to claim and press for the determination of a more
                                definite status. The French demands too for prompt demobilization
                                will become more insistent as time goes on. M. <persName>de
                                    Fleuriau</persName> drew the parallel of 1870 when it was not
                                illegal for the French to trade with the enemy, while since the
                                Decree of October 1914 it has been, and therefore is so through the
                                duration of the Armistice as well.</p>
                            <p>Both the Ambassador and he believe that the question of feeding
                                Germany should be settled without delay, not so much for the need of
                                food among the German people as for the moral support that the
                                supplying of it would give to the Government at the time in power in
                                Germany. It was necessary therefore to determine which group of the
                                present “Directorate General” in Germany should be thus favored.</p>
                            <p>He concluded by saying that he feared no real work could be
                                accomplished by the Peace Conference before January 1st, as the
                                preliminary meetings would as usual be discursive and ceremonial,
                                and reminded me that neither M. Cambon nor himself desired to claim
                                the authorship of the “Project” herewith enclosed.</p>

                            <p>I.—Germany will furnish a list of the property of her nationals in
                                foreign countries. Of these properties she must requisition those
                                indicated to her by the French Government so as to put them at their
                                disposal, as a means of payment.</p>
                            <p>II.—Germany will make known the orders and options placed by her in

                                these options and orders for which the payment will be guaranteed by
                                Germany and will be credited to her pro rata in settlement.</p>
                            <p>III.—Germany will renounce all concessions which she obtained from
                                her Allies, and will instruct the Government (?) to give notice of
                                that renunciation as it sees fit.</p>
                            <p>She will compile a list of all existing concessions to her account or
                                that of her dependants in the other countries. The Government (?)
                                reserving to itself the right with the consent of the grantor, to
                                substitute itself for the German Government or its subjects.</p>
                            <p>IV.—Germany will annul all measures taken on her territory or in the
                                countries administered by her during the war to the prejudice of the
                                French, (distraints, sequestrations, forced sales, expropriations,
                                etc.) and will make good in money or other means indicated by the

                                character, which by reason of the duration of the war, would be
                                disadvantageous to French citizens, such as accounts falling due,
                                prescriptions on securities and dividend warrants, etc.</p>
                            <p>VI.—Germany will deliver at the request of the French Government and

                                of the maximum quantities named in schedule No.—a consignment of raw

                            <p>The price of these materials and products will be fixed each year by
                                the Commission provided for in the said schedule No.—. This price
                                free of all customs dues and taxes will be charged to the total of
                                the sums due from Germany to France, in fulfillment of the present

                            <p>Germany will fix an export duty on exported products, of German
                                origin or manufacture. This duty will be payable in the currency of
                                the receiver country. The total will be remitted direct, according
                                to a proportion to be fixed, to the Allied creditor Governments.</p>
                            <p>II.—A special mortgage will be fixed on the revenues collected on the
                                left bank of the Rhine (general taxes, customs, railways, property
                                of all kind).</p>
                            <p>III.—An International Commission will control the revenues set apart
                                for the pledge and will guarantee the payment by the enemy at fixed
                                periods. Its composition and functions are determined in schedule
                                No.—.</p>
                            <p>IV.—In case of non-performance of one of the above clauses or delay
                                in payment at the times fixed, the International Commission of the
                                German Debt will have power to fix terms or delays with or without a
                                moratorium, to accord with the surrenders partial or complete, as
                                provided in Annexe No.—.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, special pledges (such as maritime duties, import
                                charges, etc.) will be agreed upon which in the same case of
                                non-performance or delay can be seized effectively, at the request
                                of the International Commission of the German Debt, by forces
                                designated for that purpose by the Allies.</p>

                            <p>The indemnity detailed in the preceding paragraphs will be a charge
                                upon the German Government and will be deducted from the sums due by

                            <p>II.—<hi rend="smallcaps">French property sold in Germany</hi>. The
                                sales of French interests and property effected by the application
                                of special war legislation will be, at the request of the former

                                improvements, fixed in case of disagreement, by the Tribunal
                                established by Article X. If the French owner accepts the sale, he
                                can establish the price before the Tribunal established by Article
                                X. The sums arising from the sale or fixed by the Tribunal will be

                            Monday at Metz and Strassburg respectively. I traveled with the

                            of deputies and Senators. All my colleagues of the diplomatic corps also
                            made the trip. The size of the crowd at both places, particularly at
                            Strassburg, as well as the enthusiasm of the people, furnished a
                            spectacle which none of the party was prepared to see. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PR1">Poincaré</persName>’s declaration in his
                            speech at Metz in which, referring to the scene which he had witnessed
                            in the streets of that city, that the plebiscite was an accomplished
                            fact, was abundantly borne out by every feature of the demonstration in
                            both cities. This enthusiasm was so genuine, being shown not only by
                            everybody coming to the city, from the neighboring country, but by
                            residences and commercial houses which were one mass of flags, that no
                            doubt could exist as to the sentiments which there prevail for France. I
                            could like[n] the scene[s] to nothing better perhaps than to say that
                            they resembled family reunions of members long separated. At Strasbourg,
                            the crowds in numbers were beyond anything I have ever seen, every
                            street [garbled group] place being literally packed with people from the
                            smallest children to the most aged ones, the latter of whom must have
                            contrasted such scenes with those of the German occupation of nearly 50
                            years ago. Before the reviewing stand a procession aggregating several
                            miles in length composed of civic organizations, thousands of gaily
                            bedecked Alsatian girls, some in the ancient costume of the land, passed
                            by to the music of many bands. <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0449"
                            />Thousands of soldiers of General <persName>Gourand</persName>’s army
                            also passed in review. Some of these bore the tattered flags of their
                            regiments, while others commanded the cumbersome tanks ending up the
                            procession. A number of special ceremonies characterized the visit in
                            both cities, in a number of which President <persName corresp="#p_PR1"
                                >Poincaré</persName> made eloquent speeches attesting the
                            significance of the great victory and the mutual affection which has so
                            long bonded together the people of Alsace Lorraine and the mother
                            country of France. In all the speeches made by the local officials, of
                                [<hi rend="italic">both?</hi>] America and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName> came in for a most generous
                            recognition for the part taken in the liberation from German domination
                            of these cities. All in all it was a convincing demonstration to all
                            those present of the feeling of loyalty which must overwhelmingly exist
                            in those lost provinces towards France.</p>

                            </head>
                            <p>The French Government is considering how to deal, in consultation
                                with the associated Governments, with the economic problems during
                                the transitional period after the war.</p>
                            <p>The French Government’s aim is to avoid too deep a perturbation in
                                the social life of nations and to prevent some of them having
                                suddenly to face a disadvantageous situation, solely caused by the
                                war.</p>
                            <p>Up to the present, the supplies for the Allies are mostly guaranteed
                                through interallied organizations that are connected with either the
                                Allied Food Council or the Inter-allied Maritime Transport Council
                                or the Programme Committees.</p>
                            <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0450"/>
                            <p>The French Government realizes that these organizations must be
                                modified so as to be adapted to the new conditions deriving from the
                                cessation of hostilities; however, they want to expose to President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Wilson</persName> that, in their
                                opinion, these councils cannot be suppressed without all the Allies
                                incurring a great danger before they could discuss of new steps that
                                would be found opportune.</p>
                            <p>Therefore the French Government expresses the earnest wish that
                                American Representatives be maintained until further notice in these
                                councils, at least as consulting members.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday afternoon I went by appointment to call on Marshal
                                <persName>Joffre</persName>,<note n="23" xml:id="d344fn23">

                                Commander in Chief of the French Armies, 1914–16.</note> and I
                            repeated to him a remark the Secretary of State had made in conversation
                            with me concerning the Marshal’s popularity in America and America’s
                            opinion of his services in the war. I told him that I had asked the
                            Secretary’s permission to repeat this.</p>
                        <p>The Marshal’s eyes filled with tears, and he asked me to express to the
                            Secretary of State his deep gratitude and to say that such a tribute
                            from America, conveyed by the lips of the Secretary, atoned to him for
                            the hours during which he had seemed to be overlooked and forgotten.</p>
                        <p>He then spoke to me at length on conditions in France and in Germany. At
                            the end of this conversation, which lasted more than an hour, I asked
                            his permission to inform the Secretary of all he had said. He replied
                            that he would be happy to have me do so. He asked me to present his
                            respects to the Secretary and say he would be much honored if he could
                            have a personal interview with him; but that in any event he begged
                            permission to remain in contact with the Secretary through me.</p>
                        <p>Appended is a report of the Marshal’s conversation, as written out by me
                            from memory immediately after leaving him. A long intimacy having made
                            me familiar with the Marshal’s opinions, train of thought, and usual
                            phraseology, I can say that this is an accurate rendering in condensed
                            form of his words on this occasion.</p>

                                        While they have haggled and delayed over clauses of the
                                        armistice, there have been genuine material difficulties in
                                        their way. After peace is signed, they will probably haggle
                                        and seek to delay over executing the peace conditions. But
                                        they are eager to end the present state of affairs; and we

                                        have accepted, as well as to avert the possibility of
                                        another war. What we want is a stable German Government to

                                        Government should last only for a time. Some clauses will

                                    <p>“The question of annexing the Left Bank of the Rhine ought
                                        not to be agitated at present. Any attempt to settle the
                                        definite status of those provinces would be not only
                                        premature but a mistake. The Allied armies must occupy the
                                        territory during all the years which will pass before the
                                        clauses of the Peace Treaty are fulfilled. That alone should
                                        be considered. To this end, it would be well for the
                                        occupied provinces to have provisional autonomy under our
                                        military supervision. We certainly could not allow them to
                                        be attached to the new German State and hold elections to
                                        send representatives to the German parliament. At the end of
                                        twenty or thirty years, the status could be definitely
                                        decided, whether annexation to France, or reversion to
                                        Germany, or complete autonomy, or a protectorate. Meanwhile,
                                        Germany could continue to claim the provinces theoretically
                                        if she wished—as she probably would.</p>
                                    <p>“I must say here, however, that only the Rhine as a frontier
                                        can offer to France absolute security against future
                                        aggressions. But we cannot and must not violate the
                                        principle of the Freedom of Peoples.</p>

                                    <p>“There are at this moment in France two situations giving
                                        rise to the gravest concern: one is the slowness of
                                        demobilization, and the other is inadequacy in
                                        transportation facilities.</p>

                                    </p>
                                    <p>“We have not yet worked out any effective system for
                                        demobilization. Early in October, more than a month before
                                        the Armistice was signed, the Director of one of the
                                        Divisions of the Ministry of War sent in to the Minister a
                                        report recommending that plans for demobilization be drawn
                                        up without loss of time. M. <persName corresp="#p_CGEB1"
                                            >Clemenceau</persName> turned down the suggestion,
                                        saying: ‘I am making war.’ The Armistice came so suddenly
                                        that everybody was taken by surprise; and save for the fact
                                        that a few old soldiers are being released, our
                                        demobilization is no more advanced to-day than it was
                                        then.</p>
                                    <p>“A spirit is arising in the army which will develop to
                                        serious proportions unless the cause is remedied very soon.
                                        There is no insubordination as yet, but there are both
                                        impatience and discontent. Hundreds of thousands of French
                                        soldiers, kept on a war footing and having nothing
                                        particular to do, see the industries of peace reviving for
                                        others while they themselves are debarred from earning
                                        money. They cannot understand such a condition of affairs,
                                        and they say so in writing to their families; who, in turn,
                                        become exasperated, lacking the support and the
                                        companionship of the men. This is playing precisely into the
                                        hands of the Socialists, who will not fail to make the best
                                        of it in favor of their own agitation.</p>
                                    <p>“The only remedy is prompt and effective demobilization,
                                        which we have no reason to fear since Germany is now
                                        powerless militarily.</p>

                                    <p>“The second grave situation I have mentioned adds further
                                        complications to the first. We are exposed to shortness of
                                        food and of materials not because we lack either, for our
                                        stocks are sufficient while not abundant, but because of
                                        difficulties in transportation. The rolling stock is
                                        insufficient; but far worse, there is not enough labor.</p>
                                    <p>“Last July, the question became acute. The Ministry of Public
                                        Works asked the Ministry of War to lend some tens of
                                        thousands of men, amounting roughly to forty thousand, from
                                        the Reserves of the Territorial Army, to help with the
                                        railroads. While unskilled at the start, these men gradually
                                        learned their new business, and did much towards relieving
                                        congestion. But now they are to be released, because they
                                        are for the most part old men belonging to the only classes
                                            <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0455"/>which will be
                                        demobilized. They cannot be replaced by the former railroad
                                        men who have since been serving in the army, because those
                                        men remain mobilized. The only solution found has been to
                                        call for volunteers from all classes of workmen and
                                        agricultural laborers. 30,000 have already responded; 60,000
                                        are needed, and will probably be found. But this will be
                                        entirely unskilled labor, the technical education of a large
                                        number of men will be begun during a crisis when a maximum
                                        of skilled effort is needed.</p>
                                    <p>“We must have better distribution in France if we are to
                                        avoid a very serious shortage of necessaries. In the
                                        reconquered regions of the north and east, that shortage
                                        already exists, and the congestion is aggravated by the
                                        policy of using nothing but military means in the army zone.
                                        We are also obliged to feed Germany to the extent of her
                                        absolute requirements, though the Allies must of course come
                                        first; by exposing Germany to want, we should expose
                                        ourselves to many complications.</p>
                                    <p>“In closing, I shall give you a homely example of existing
                                        difficulties.</p>
                                    <p>“I am short of vinegar for my household, and have had trouble
                                        in buying it. Three months ago, my brother at Perpignan sent
                                        me a barrelful of his own making. It did not reach me. I
                                        wrote and inquired. At the end of a month, he shipped
                                        another barrel to me. That did not come, so I wrote again.
                                        He sent me a third shipment, six quarts not by freight but
                                        by parcels post, packed according to regulations. That was a
                                        month ago, and the parcel has not yet reached me any more
                                        than either of the barrels.</p>
                                    <p>“The story is not trivial, because there are similar
                                        instances in almost incalculable numbers, affecting to a
                                        greater or lesser degree the population of our entire
                                        country, and promising to grow much worse.”</p>

                            <p>In order to alleviate the labour of the Conference and to facilitate
                                the settlement of some special questions, the following practice
                                might be laid down in principle:—</p>
                            <p>A direct understanding (or at least an attempt to come to a previous
                                agreement) between belligerents, neutrals, and States in process of
                                formation on matters which specially affect their own interests, but
                                only concern other Powers secondarily, would precede any discussion
                                of the questions by the assembled Plenipotentiaries.</p>
                            <p>This might, for instance, be done in the case of Slesvig (between
                                Denmark and Germany); the Aland Isles (a previous understanding
                                between Sweden and Finland); the questions of the Scheldt and of
                                Limburg (between the Netherlands and Belgium); the Banat of Temesvar
                                (between Roumania and Serbia); and perhaps even Yugoslavia (between
                                Serbia and Italy).</p>
                            <p>In the case of an agreement being reached between the principal
                                States concerned, the discussion at the Conference, for the general
                                and final settlement of the question, would be greatly
                                facilitated.</p>
                            <p>Should the parties fail to come to an understanding, the Conference
                                would take the matter up again as a whole.</p>

                            <p>A document or proposal may be brought forward only by one of the
                                Plenipotentiaries and in the name of the Power which he

                                discussion and will aim at reaching an agreement in principle. After
                                the questions have been discussed in their essential features, the
                                second reading will be taken, at which the details may be

                            <p>As to the third section, Representation of Enemy Powers, no comment
                                is required at this time.</p>
                            <p>The fourth section, dealing with Technical Delegates, is of very
                                great importance and should be the subject of careful consideration.
                                Without attempting to analyze the questions which must be presented
                                to an international conference of this kind and which inevitably
                                arise in the course of its proceedings, it is obvious that there are
                                two classes—the one of a general and a political nature, which can
                                only be decided by the States themselves through delegates
                                exercising political powers; the other technical, to be examined by
                                persons familiar with the subject matter who are to put at the
                                disposal of their respective delegations and the Conference the
                                means by which the general purposes may be accomplished. They may be
                                called scientific understudies. They do not possess or exercise
                                political power, but examine <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0469"
                                />and report on questions or phases of questions submitted to them,
                                deriving whatever representative power they may possess from their
                                respective Plenipotentiaries, addressing the Conference with its
                                permission, if it provides for their participation, and under the
                                supervision and control of their Plenipotentiaries. In recommending
                                the selection of technical delegates, the plan follows the example,
                                and is no doubt guided by the experience of the most recent
                                international conferences—the First Hague Peace Conference of 1899,
                                in which twenty-six States were represented, and the Second Hague
                                Peace Conference of 1907, in which forty-four participated. The
                                technical delegates greatly facilitated the work of these two
                                bodies, and it is believed that a considerable number of persons who
                                took part in the Second Hague Conference in that capacity are
                                attached to various commissions and, with the addition of other
                                highly trained persons at present in Paris, may render similar
                                services in the approaching Conference. The provision concerning
                                technical delegates seems to be an integral part of the French plan,
                                inasmuch as in the third division provision is made for the
                                appointment of commissions to consist of Plenipotentiaries and
                                committees to be composed of technical delegates, and in the very
                                last article of the proposed rules for the Conference a drafting
                                committee is composed, to consist of six technical delegates to the
                                exclusion of Plenipotentiaries.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>This division, it will be observed, consists of three sections, the
                                first dealing with the principles which are to control the
                                discussions; the second, numbers 2, 3, and 4, with the problems
                                confronting the Conference, denominated, respectively, territorial,
                                financial, and economic; and the third with the operation of the
                                Society of Nations, forming a fifth and final section of this
                                division.</p>
                            <p>These provisions speak for themselves and need not be analyzed, as
                                they are, with the exception of the first pub-section, an
                                enumeration, not a discussion of the problems. In regard to this
                                first subsection, it will be observed that the organization of the
                                Society of Nations is last but one of the group of “directing
                                principles.” It is obvious, however, that, if a League or
                                Association of Nations is to be formed and to possess certain powers
                                to be exercised in the interest of the contracting States, this
                                subject should be first considered, inasmuch as the acceptance of
                                this principle and the nature and power of the League or Association
                                will necessarily affect many, if not all, other questions. This does
                                not mean, however, that the work of the Conference should be
                                postponed, in order to take up and to decide this principle, for
                                commissions and committees can be appointed to consider the other
                                matters contained in the program. As, however, they <pb n="400"
                                    xml:id="pg_400" facs="0470"/>depend upon the nature of the
                                League or Association, they cannot assume definite shape until the
                                League or Association has been accepted in principle and an
                                agreement reached upon its nature and the scope of its powers. The
                                plan appreciates apparently the importance of the League or
                                Association, as appears from the fifth of the sub-divisions, but
                                instead of leaving the matters mentioned in the concluding
                                paragraphs of this section for later discussion, they should, it is
                                believed, be considered at the very beginning of the Conference and
                                in connection with the constitution and operation of that
                                organization.</p>

                            <p>This division consists of two sections: first, the rules of procedure
                                of the Conference, a draft project of which forms the subject matter
                                of the sixth division of the plan and will not be discussed in this
                                place; second, an enumeration of the principal questions to be
                                discussed by the Conference and to be submitted to commissions
                                composed of Plenipotentiaries and to committees composed of
                                technical delegates. As this is an enumeration, not an analysis, and
                                is not accompanied by discussion or expression of opinion, it does
                                not seem necessary to do more in this place than to call attention
                                to it.</p>
                            <p>An agreement reached upon the subject matter contained in these three
                                divisions by the Supreme Council of Versailles would enable the
                                Conference to meet and to proceed to its own organization, to
                                arrange its program, and to devise rules for its procedure. As
                                previously stated, divisions four, five, and six deal with this

                            <p>This section is entitled, “The Order proposed for the Examination of
                                Territorial and Political Problems.” All the problems mentioned in
                                this section will necessarily be discussed by the Conference. They
                                are all important and there will no doubt be a divergence of opinion
                                as to the order in which they shall be approached or discussed. They
                                are in the order of the plan arranged as follows: <list>

                            <p>The method of procedure contained in this very important division
                                has, it is believed, met with general approval and is likely to be
                                followed <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0471"/>by the Conference
                                when it meets and is organized for work. By means thereof many
                                questions of general importance, but which have a special interest
                                for certain Powers or groups of Powers could be discussed by their
                                representatives outside of the Conference. In some instances at
                                least an accord would be reached which then could be laid before the
                                conference for its modification or approval, inasmuch as the special
                                would inevitably have to yield to the general interest. Doubtless
                                these special questions, even when only two Powers seem to be
                                concerned would be discussed with representatives of France, Great
                                Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States, as representing in a
                                way the general interest, especially so outside of the Conference.
                                Even in the examples given by the plan of special interests, which
                                could be discussed between the respective parties, it is believed
                                that the general interest would have to be represented, as it is
                                very difficult to see how any agreement of a satisfactory nature
                                could be reached without consulting the larger and general interests
                                that must necessarily be involved. This is evident from the
                                following examples, to be found in this part of the plan: <quote

                                        Serbia and Italy).”</p>

                            <p>The proposed rules of procedure consist of sixteen articles, the
                                first two of which deal with the question of representation
                                calculated to give effect to the principles laid down in the section
                                entitled, “Representation of States,” which the plan presupposes has
                                been approved by the Supreme Council of Versailles. The table
                                contained in the first division is applicable to the second article
                                of the proposed regulations. The first two articles, however, are a
                                decided improvement in form, inasmuch as the classification of the
                                States into big and little, so annoying to most of the States, for
                                only five at present can claim to be great Powers has been discarded
                                and, in lieu thereof, they are grouped according to a general
                                principle accomplishing the same purpose, but in language and in
                                terms consistent with the equality of States. Thus, five belligerent
                                Powers—France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United
                                States—have a general interest, and as such are recognized as
                                possessing a general as distinct from a specific or particular
                                interest, and are therefore entitled to take part in all sessions
                                and in all commissions. The other belligerent Powers having what may
                                be considered a special interest, in the sense that they are
                                particularly interested in certain questions, are therefore entitled
                                to take part in the sessions of the Conference in which these
                                matters are discussed. In <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0472"
                                />like manner, the plan recognizes that neutral Powers, as well as
                                States in process of formation, are interested in certain phases of
                                the program, and it is therefore provided that they participate
                                either orally or in writing, upon invitation of the five Powers
                                having a general interest in the sessions of the Conference devoted
                                to the discussion of such questions.</p>
                            <p>Article three provides that the Powers are to be alphabetically
                                arranged according to their French names. To this there is no
                                objection, as it has proved to be a very successful manner of
                                avoiding conflicts as to precedence. The question, however, arises
                                as to the proper name of some of the countries. For example, Brazil
                                is technically known as the United States of Brazil, yet it appears
                                as Brazil; the United States is properly denominated the United
                                States of America, yet it appears as Etats-Unis, although in the
                                Second Peace Conference of 1907 it was denominated “America, United
                                States of.” Then, too, Great Britain appears as England—the French
                                whereof is Angleterre, which would place that country at the head of
                                the list and enable it first of all to express its opinion upon the
                                taking of votes. There may be no objection to this latter phase of
                                the question, but England does not exist internationally except as a
                                part of Great Britain, and in the Second Hague Peace Conference, to
                                speak only of this international gathering, it appeared as
                                Grande-Bretagne, not as Angleterre. While these may be considered
                                details, it is of importance to the Conference and to the world at
                                large that a contracting party be officially designated, so that the
                                agreement may be seen to be binding upon it without the necessity of
                                explanation.</p>
                            <p>Article four provides that the Conferences, meaning thereby the
                                Conference or Congress, shall be opened by the President of the
                                Republic. This is customary in Republics. The Prime Minister of
                                France is immediately thereafter to assume the provisional
                                presidency. It is in accordance with custom that a high official,
                                usually the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the country in which the
                                Conference meets, takes the chair provisionally. Even in conferences
                                not called by the country in which they meet, as in the case of the
                                two Hague Conferences, the Minister of Foreign Affairs opens the
                                meeting, but yields to a President chosen by the Conference,
                                doubtless by pre-arrangement among the delegates. In the case of the
                                Hague Conferences, the presiding officer was not a delegate from
                                Holland, but the First Delegate of Russia.</p>
                            <p>It is next provided that the full powers of the delegates shall be
                                referred to a committee composed of the First Plenipotentiaries of
                                each of the Allied or Associated Powers. This is especially
                                necessary in a case of this kind, where the Powers must be in good
                                and due <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0473"/>form, and to
                                prevent the admission of a community which is not as yet recognized
                                as a State or in the form in which it presents itself.</p>
                            <p>The fifth article thereupon provides that after the verification of
                                the Powers, a definitive President and four Vice Presidents shall be
                                chosen “in alphabetical order.” While the meaning of this is not
                                quite clear, it would seem that the author of the plan under
                                discussion contemplated the choice of a President from among the
                                five Powers having a general interest, and that the Vice Presidents
                                should be chosen from among each of these Powers, to rank according
                                to the alphabetical order of the French names of the countries. The
                                author of the plan doubtless contemplates that the permanent
                                President shall be a representative of France, inasmuch as the
                                Secretariat chosen outside of the delegations will be “presented to
                                the approval of the Plenipotentiaries by the President, who is taxed
                                with the responsibility and control thereof.”</p>
                            <p>On the supposition that the permanent President is to be a
                                representative of France and the Vice Presidents chosen from the
                                five Powers having a general interest, each of the remaining four
                                would have a Vice President, and Great Britain (Angleterre) would
                                have the first Vice President, who would therefore be the Presiding
                                Officer in the absence of the President. The question of the
                                alphabet is therefore not without its importance.</p>
                            <p>Article six organizes the Secretariat in the manner already stated.
                                Its duties are those of a Secretary’s office, with the very
                                important provision that the archives shall always be open to the
                                members of the Conference.</p>
                            <p>The next article deals primarily with the question of publicity,
                                providing that official “communiqués” are to be prepared by the
                                Secretariat and made public at the same hour every day. Two hours
                                before publication, they are to be open to the examination of the
                                members of the Conference. Each member of the Conference has the
                                right to have a change made in the “communiqués” and to have a
                                statement of that fact made at the beginning of the next
                                meeting.</p>
                            <p>Finally, both the Powers represented and their delegates formally
                                renounce the right to make any other communications concerning the
                                labors of the Conference.</p>
                            <p>From this statement of the terms of Article seven it is apparent that
                                the United States should be represented in the Secretariat by an
                                intelligent person, competent in such matters, possessing judgment,
                                discretion, and an accurate knowledge of French, inasmuch as the
                                American delegation would of necessity be forced to rely in great
                                part upon the information which he should communicate to its members
                                regarding these matters.</p>
                            <p>The plan now comes to the question of language and, given its origin,
                                not unnaturally provides that French shall be the official <pb
                                    n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0474"/>language both for the
                                deliberations and the acts of the Conferences. This is in accordance
                                with custom, but it has never been satisfactory to delegates of
                                other languages. An attempt is made to meet this objection, as in
                                the case of other conferences, by allowing delegates to present
                                their observations or oral communications in the language of their
                                choice, on the condition that a French translation thereof be
                                immediately made. It is further provided that, if the speaker
                                desires it, the text of his observations or communications may be
                                annexed to the minutes in the language in which they were delivered.
                                It has been the custom of international conferences meeting in
                                Europe to adopt French as the official language, even although the
                                conferences were held in countries where French was not the official
                                language. The Congress of Vienna (1814–15), the Congress of Berlin
                                (1878), and the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, and the
                                Conference of Algeciras of 1906 are recent examples. In the present
                                instance, the French Government will no doubt insist that the reason
                                is all the stronger, inasmuch as the participating Powers are
                                meeting in France. This argument will no doubt be more satisfactory
                                to them than to the other delegates, and whatever argument is used,
                                the adoption of one official language to the exclusion of others is
                                not likely to be agreeable to those whose language is not adopted.
                                The question, however, is very delicate and it is called to the
                                attention of the American Commission without recommendation.</p>
                            <p>Articles nine and ten deal with the method of presenting documents
                                and of laying propositions before the Conference, and it is believed
                                that, if French be adopted as the official language, there is no
                                objection to them, as they are calculated to facilitate the conduct
                                of the proceedings by requiring that the text of the documents and
                                the motions be presented in advance of their discussion, and that no
                                motion, unless connected with a proposition or springing out of it
                                or in amendment of it, be made without being previously presented
                                and read by the Plenipotentiaries, who alone are authorized to
                                present a document or to make a proposition in behalf of or in the
                                name of the Power they represent.</p>
                            <p>It is the experience of international conferences that many documents
                                and projects are presented to them by unauthorized persons. Article
                                eleven provides that these shall be received by the Secretariat and
                                only those of them communicated in summary form to the
                                Plenipotentiaries which seem to have a political interest,
                                justifying this action. For purpose of reference, however, these
                                documents are to be placed in the archives.</p>
                            <p>Article twelve of the proposed rules requires a first and second
                                reading of the proposition submitted. In the first the general
                                principle will be discussed; in the second the details.</p>
                            <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0475"/>
                            <p>The thirteenth Article takes up the question of Technical Delegates,
                                who may be authorized by the Plenipotentiaries with the consent of
                                the Conference to present technical explanations upon questions or
                                phases thereof which may seem to render such explanations useful. It
                                next states that the matter may at the instance of the Conference be
                                submitted to a committee composed of technical delegates to present
                                a report and proposed solution. The possibility of such a method of
                                procedure seems so obvious as not to require comment. The
                                Plenipotentiaries must deal with the question of principle and they
                                ought to be authorized to appoint assistants to deal with the
                                details and applications of the principle.</p>
                            <p>It may also be in the interest of the Conference as a whole to have
                                the matter or series of matters referred to a committee composed of
                                technical persons in order to free itself from details of this kind
                                and to save the time and energy of its members for the larger
                                problems.</p>
                            <p>The fourteenth Article requires the rule of unanimity without,
                                however, binding the minority in a case where opinion is divided.
                                There are, however, many questions of procedure which do not affect
                                principle. In this case it is provided by the article in
                                consideration that the view of the majority will prevail unless the
                                minority should make a formal protest.</p>
                            <p>The next Article, fifteenth, likewise deals with a matter that can
                                properly be called one of procedure, requiring that the protocols be
                                printed and distributed to the delegates as soon as possible; that
                                their distribution shall take the place of the reading of the
                                minutes and that if no modification in the text of the minutes is
                                requested by the Plenipotentiaries the procotol is to be considered
                                approved and is deposited with the archives. Should a change be
                                requested in the text it is to be read by the President at the
                                beginning of the next session and the entire protocol is to be read
                                upon the request of any Plenipotentiary.</p>
                            <p>The last and 16th Article raises a question of very great importance.
                                The experience of International Conferences shows that propositions
                                adopted, however carefully prepared, require editing. The experience
                                of international conferences also shows that the drafting of texts
                                is a highly technical matter, and that it should be confided to a
                                commission for this purpose. The Plan, therefore, proposes that a
                                drafting committee (<hi rend="italic">comité de rédaction</hi>),
                                composed of six technical delegates, be appointed, representing each
                                of the following languages: French, Portuguese, English, Italian,
                                Slav, and German. This arrangement is open to the objection that
                                Germany will not be a member of the Conference.</p>
                            <p>Again, it will be observed that only one person is to represent the
                                English-speaking peoples. The presence of a technical delegate <pb
                                    n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0476"/>from Great Britain would no
                                doubt satisfy that country. It is doubtful whether such a choice
                                would be pleasing to the self-governing Dominions; it is certain
                                that neither Great Britain nor the self-governing Dominions would be
                                satisfied if the representatives of the English language upon the
                                committee happened to be an American. In any event, the United
                                States would not care to be represented in the delicate matter of
                                language by a person whose chief interests are concerned with the
                                destinies of the other branch of English-speaking peoples.</p>
                            <p>But supposing the difficulty of language to be overcome, another
                                important one presents itself. Changes in the wording of a text
                                often affect form as well as substance, when only the former is
                                intended. The presence of one or more Plenipotentiaries would
                                therefore be desirable upon the Committee. The Second Hague Peace
                                Conference met and overcame these difficulties. It appointed a
                                drafting commission composed of the chief plenipotentiary of each of
                                the participating powers. This commission formed a sub-committee
                                composed of some of the plenipotentiaries and of technical
                                delegates, under the presidency of the late Mr.
                                    <persName>Renault</persName>. The texts were presented to this
                                committee as they were voted by the Conference and given form and
                                precision. Any changes in meaning were noted and sometimes changes
                                affecting substance were made, as they seemed desirable. The texts
                                as thus drafted were submitted to the drafting commission, approved
                                by it, reported to the Conference in plenary session, and approved
                                unanimously by that body. It is believed that the 16th Article
                                should be modified so as to overcome some of the objections to it in
                                its present form, and that the experience of the most recent
                                international conference should be profitably availed of.</p>

                        <p>In my private conversation with <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd
                                George</persName> yesterday he said that Great Britain desired the
                            United States to become trustee for German East African colonies. That
                            Great Britain was unwilling that they should be turned back to Germany
                            for the reason that the Germans had used such inhuman methods in their
                            treatment of the natives. He said Southwest Africa and the Asiatic
                            islands belonging to Germany must go to the South African Federation and
                            to Australia respectively; that unless this was done Great Britain would
                            be confronted by a revolution in those dominions.</p>
                        <p>He thought Great Britain would have to assume a protectorate over
                            Mesopotamia and perhaps Palestine. Arabia he thought should become
                            autonomous. France might be given a sphere of influence in Syria.</p>
                        <p>My feeling as to his suggestion regarding German East Africa is that the
                            British would like us to accept something so they might more freely take
                            what they desire.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">George</persName> also thought the Allies
                            should get together before the Peace Conference and thresh out their
                            differences. He believed the Peace Conference itself need not last
                            longer than 1 week. The preliminary conference he thought could be
                            finished in 3 or 4 weeks.</p>
                        <p>I strongly advise against this procedure and for reasons which will be
                            obvious to you.</p>

                            and Coalition Government which has been noticeably increasing has
                            recently assumed serious proportions. For some days influential section
                            of the press has brought all the power of its leading articles to bear
                            in an endeavor to bring out a statement of the Government’s policy with
                            regard to the expulsion of enemy aliens, the payment of an indemnity by
                            Germany and the treatment of the <persName>Kaiser</persName> and others
                            who are generally considered responsible for bringing about the war and
                            Germany’s illegal methods of warfare. The Prime Minister has as yet
                            carefully refrained from tying himself to any definite policy or making
                            any firm statement on these matters. In recent editorial the <hi
                                rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi>, always a strenuous supporter of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName>, practically
                            threatened to forsake him unless he gave satisfactory undertakings with
                            regard to these particular problems, which the North cliffe press
                            considers of supreme importance. Should this group of newspapers desert
                            the coalition it would only be supported by the <hi rend="italic">London
                                Chronicle</hi>, a newspaper recently bought for a large <pb n="410"
                                xml:id="pg_410" facs="0480"/>sum by a few personal friends of the
                            Prime Minister, and which has as yet no great influence, and by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, which has always been a
                            pronounced unionist organ. The other opposition sections continue to
                            play the old tune on the strings of the inadvisability of a general
                            election at this time. The practical disenfranchisement of the army and
                            control of nomination by a Coalition committee which exacts pledges from
                            Coalition or Liberal Coalition candidates under the threat of vigorous
                            opposition. These various forms of dissatisfaction have crystallized
                            into a pronounced opposition which makes the result of the election more
                            and more precarious. There is little doubt, however, that the coalition
                            will succeed in winning the seats necessary for a majority, although
                            they may fall somewhat short of their ambitions. It is not likely that
                            those sections which have hitherto supported Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName> will go back on him
                            completely at the last moment, chiefly because there is no other party
                            leader to whom they would be willing to turn their support. Their
                            present attitude is more in the nature of a threat and an attempt to
                            draw from the Prime Minister some definite statement of policy, and a
                            promise to carry through certain reforms which they hold much at heart
                            to the majority of thinking men. The questions which the popular press
                            is placing in the foreground should take a more or less secondary place,
                            but their appeal for the mass of voters, especially in view of the
                            increased panel, is very great. The difficulties in the way of settling,
                            at the present time, a hard and fast program for dealing with these
                            problems is not fully appreciated. While these are all obviously matters
                            which must be settled at the Peace Conference and in conjunction with
                            the other Allied nations, there is great impatience on the part of
                            people in the country who fear that the enemy are to be let off too
                            easily. <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName> has already
                            hinted at the difficulties in the way by stating that Germany will not
                            be allowed to pay her indemnity by the defaulters cheap goods or dumping
                            manufactured articles in this country to the prejudice of British trade.
                            Great enthusiasm has been shown over the visit of <persName

                                >Clemenceau</persName> to this country and obviously every effort is
                            being made to strengthen the Entente between France and Great Britain in
                            order that any possible friction before or during the coming Conference
                            may be prevented. The President’s visit to Europe continues to excite
                            the greatest interest, there have been lengthy accounts of the
                            opposition in the American Senate and of the bitterness and distrust
                            with which the Republicans are said to view the entire procedure. No
                            pronouncement of opinions have been given in this country and the desire
                            for the President’s visit to England is undoubtedly sincere and
                            strong.</p>

                        <p>On November 28th the Labor Party issued election manifesto demanding a
                            peace of international cooperation free from economic war, and
                            international labor charter incorporated in the league of free peoples,
                            democratic freedom for Ireland and India and self-determination for all
                            subject peoples within the British Commonwealth, no conscription and
                            free speech, land nationalization, building at state expense, one

                            debt by special levy on capital together with heavily graduated direct
                            taxation of incomes, nationalization and democratic control of public
                            services, such as mines, railways, shipping, electricity, usual

                            and pensions for the soldier. <persName>John Hodge</persName>, Minister
                            of Pensions, has been called on by his trade union to retire from the
                            Government, and though probably unopposed at the coming election, he
                            will be unable to resume his place in the Ministry. The breaking away of
                            Labor from the Government is almost complete, in some constituencies the
                            Liberals will support a Labor candidate. <persName>Henderson</persName>
                            having referred a dispute between two Labor nominees to a ballot of
                            Labor Party members, mostly miners in the constituency, the extremist
                            nominee was officially indorsed by plurality of 4,000. The Labor meeting
                            at the <persName>Albert Hall</persName> was finally held on November
                            30th, and a second meeting was held on December 1st. The first object of
                            both meetings was support to League of Nations, and the speakers urged
                            the Labor Party to watch the proceedings of the Peace Conference in
                            order to make sure that the result should be a true league of free
                            peoples. The second object was to raise funds for the conversion of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Weekly Herald</hi> into a daily paper which would
                            be the chief Labor daily. The Bolshevist element made but little
                            demonstration, though in accordance with the official Labor program both
                            meetings demanded immediate restoration workers’ International Agreement
                            as strongest safeguard to future peace. As the Labor Party during this
                            election will have no daily newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Daily
                                Mail</hi> has offered for its use one column daily. The publication
                            of an announcement by Reuter’s correspondent in Washington that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GS1">Gompers</persName> and five other members
                            of the American Federation of Labor would attend the Labor conference to

                            received in Labor circles with immense interest as the first indication
                            of official recognition of the proposed concurrent conference to which
                                <persName>Webb</persName> and <persName>Henderson</persName> attach

                            request to American exporters to pursue a policy of forbearance at this
                            time has received a certain <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0482"
                            />amount of favorable comment because of its altruistic character, the
                            question has been raised as to whether it is practicable. Many prominent
                            British trade officials consider that Government’s statement will not
                            represent the real attitude of American trade, which they expect will be
                            as eager for business as is the case in this country.</p>
                        <p>Certain large groups of American trade consider it likely that there will
                            be an attempt here to buy commodities such as timber, metals, and other
                            articles, through a central organization.</p>
                        <p>Nests of British trades in different lines are intriguing for control of
                            the situation, although it cannot be said as to whether they will
                            succeed there is already a tendency to break away from the idea of
                            central economic control, providing there are definite obstacles to
                            successful operation of unified control, British interests will be quick
                            to alter their course. The whole situation is being watched very
                            intently by different branches of British trade.</p>
                        <p>There is undoubtedly a certain feeling that we may be over ambitious
                            about the future of our merchant marine, the fact that the American
                            Government has not permitted the transfer of International Merchant [<hi
                                rend="italic">Mercantile</hi>] Marine vessels to British ownership
                            has not received any extended comments in the press except that it is a
                            matter of significance; this is looked upon, however, as crucial point.
                            There seems to be a difference of opinion on the part of various well
                            informed American investigators as to what is the real British trade
                            attitude toward America. It is the opinion of the commercial attaché to
                            this Embassy that British public opinion is strongly in favor of
                            friendly cooperation with the United States in trade matters as well as
                            in other matters, and he feels that the most prominent officials in the
                            Government share this view. At the same time it must be considered that
                            various trade interests are anxious to take full advantage of the
                            situation in order to gain as strong a position as possible, but
                            evidences even of a large number of cases of this kind should not lead
                            to the feeling that Great Britain is not preparing for a liberal
                            adjustment of trade matters at the Peace Conference. It is necessary to
                            give careful attention to all the various trade ambitions which are
                            arising so rapidly in this country, but it should be realized at the
                            same time that with careful handling there is no major reason why
                            harmony cannot be found. There is a very great desire to have trade
                            return to normal channels as soon as possible. Moreover Labor is
                            strongly in favor of a liberal settlement. Questions of trade policy
                            have apparently not been uppermost in the public mind in the election
                            campaign, though they are undoubtedly foremost in the minds [of] special
                            interests.</p>

                            attaché to Mil-Staff.</p>
                        <p>Side by side with reports from the United States of the enthusiastic
                            celebration of “Britannia’s Day” throughout the country, the London
                            press of the 9th instant, prints articles from their American
                            correspondents on what they state to be the President’s insistence on
                            the so-called American doctrine of the freedom of the seas and the
                            determination of the United States to reply to any reluctance on the
                            part of Great Britain to fall in with our views by an outbuilding
                            program of at least two keels to one. Articles of this nature which are
                            not the product of the imagination of the Washington and New York
                            correspondents of newspapers such as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
                            and the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>, but are based on utterances
                            of the American press are in the highest degree mischievous. They are
                            tending to stir up feeling in both countries on a subject which need not
                            be controversial, and to increase the complexities of the peace
                            settlement. Opinion in this country is uniformly sensitive on anything
                            that has to do with policy touching the sea, and is especially quick to
                            take unreasoning fright at any such project not clearly defined. It
                            would be greatly to our advantage if the comment of the responsible
                            American press on this subject could be minimized until after the
                            President has had an opportunity to express himself to the members of
                            the Allied Governments he will meet in Europe. There is a very uneasy
                            and even ominous feeling growing here largely based on misapprehension,
                            I am convinced, which has arisen only during the past few weeks chiefly
                            from inopportune and uninstructed American comment.</p>

                            attaché to military staff. The voting in <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414"
                                facs="0484"/>the general election was marked by a singular apathy,
                            it is only the women voters who appear to have turned out in force. The
                            Labor Party also asserts that its vote was cast at nearly full strength.
                            During the last week many people appeared to become somewhat disgusted
                            at the actions of both the Coalition and Liberal candidates and many
                            voters therefore refrained from voting at all. The days of the campaign
                            were marked by considerable bitterness, and some rather biting
                            personalities between the Prime Minister and Mr.
                                <persName>Asquith</persName>, but these were only caused by the heat
                            of the contest and should have no permanent effect. Prophecies as to the
                            outcome of the election are varied and for the present quite worthless
                            inasmuch as the votes are not counted until December 28th on account of
                            the return of the soldiers’ votes cast in France, many of which have not
                            yet been received. The press is chiefly occupied with the President’s
                            visit to Paris, of which long accounts are given. The sole question
                            concerning which any anxiety is expressed is that of the freedom of the
                            seas. The American and British attitudes on this point have [been]
                            exhaustively considered and exposed at length. For the most part
                            criticism is withheld pending some definite statement of the President’s
                            views on this matter which are being very anxiously awaited. Should they
                            not coincide with the views of the Conservative Party here there will be
                            considerable protest. The Conservative view as set forth by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> and other leading organs is that by
                            peculiar position of this country and its absolute dependence upon the
                            control of the seas and waterways leading to its outlying possessions no
                            new doctrine can be acceptable which in any way diminishes its control
                            over transportation to and from the possible enemy. It is pointed out
                            that the science of warfare has changed to such an extent that nations
                            now fight almost en masse and that practically every commodity imported
                            and exported has a direct bearing on the prosecution of hostilities. The
                            British view is that a strict control over transportation should be made
                            possible, and a blockade should be permissible as effective as any large
                            navy can make it. There is little pronounced objection to diminishing
                            the size of the British fleet providing it maintains its superiority to
                            those of the other powers. A considerable increase of our own Navy might
                            be looked upon with suspicion in some quarters but I think not by the
                            majority as long as good Anglo-American relations are assured at any
                            rate. Interest centers in the future international laws of sea control
                            and blockade rather than in the relative size of our armaments.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEF1">Gay</persName> is the possessor of the
                            historical library of the Risorgimento Period in which, as I recall it,
                            Professor <persName>Thayer</persName> states he wrote the life of

                            Committee of Inquiry, and to the President, and I have suggested that a

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEF1">Gay</persName> states that this present
                            statement regarding Africa is absolutely confidential, consisting in
                            large part, of an Italian official communication of the Government which
                            has been made known to no other Embassy and which has been given with
                            the understanding that the American Delegates will regard it as
                            absolutely confidential. Because of its confidential character, I am
                            sending it in the form of this confidential letter instead of in an
                            ordinary despatch.</p>
                        <p>Other material relating to Italy’s claims and interests in the Adriatic
                            and Mediterranean will be forwarded as soon as Mr. <persName

                        <p>Without undertaking, in any way, to assume responsibility for these
                            papers, I feel that they will prove of great interest and also of much

                                letter which I had received from President <persName>Charles
                                    Haskins</persName>, of the Research Committee, formed under the

                                the American Delegates at the Peace Conference,” requesting me to
                                prepare such material, I would say that I am preparing a series of
                                memoranda upon Italian interests.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, the request has reached me at a late date, but the
                                memoranda will be sent out in sections as rapidly as possible.<note

                                has been given with the understanding that the American Delegates

                            <p>The following brief official pronouncement was recently made by the
                                Italian government to the author of these Memoranda, regarding the
                                causes of Italy’s intervention and her purposes in the present war.
                                No one who is intimately acquainted with the course of events in
                                1914 and 1915, and who understands the character of the men who <pb

                                question the sincerity or the accuracy of the general statements
                                which it contains. But as the application of general principles to
                                concrete cases is not infrequently open to varied interpretation, so
                                in the case of Italy’s purposes and interests the honest application
                                of general principles of nationality and of international economic
                                equity to the complex racial and economic conditions created by
                                twenty centuries and more of civilization and human struggle, such
                                as those prevailing in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin,
                                is far from clear, and notwithstanding the sincere desire of Italy
                                and the Allies to establish just conditions at the Peace Conference,
                                the delimitation of frontiers must encounter difficulties of
                                unquestionable gravity.</p>

                                    of liberty, namely to exercise her inalienable right of

                                        xml:id="d354fn23">In articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty of the
                                        Triple Alliance, both of which have been published, the
                                        purely defensive character of the Alliance is clearly
                                        established; while the publication of article 7 places
                                        Austria’s attack upon Servia in 1914 in its true light as a
                                        breach of the pledges to Italy made in the Treaty, which was
                                        thereby wittingly annulled by Austria. Article 7 expressly
                                        provided that both Austria and Italy should use all their
                                        influence to maintain the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>

                                        first coming to an agreement with the other. By her wilful
                                        violation of Servian territory without first notifying
                                        Italy, Austria betrayed Italy with regard to both of these
                                        provisions. [Footnote in the original.]</note>, Italy took a
                                    firm stand against the policy of aggression and domination which
                                    inspired the Central Empires. Her declaration of neutrality
                                    freed France from all danger of attack on the south-eastern
                                    frontier, thereby liberating the French army of the Alps for
                                    service elsewhere, and rendering possible the victory of the
                                    Marne which was the first formidable blow delivered against

                                        <p>The following extract from a speech made by Senator
                                            Marconi at a banquet at the Waldorf Astoria in 1917,
                                            further emphasizes the importance for France of Italy’s
                                            declaration of neutrality: “On August 2nd. 1914, three
                                            days before England declared war upon Germany, the
                                            Italian government decided for neutrality. The news was
                                            immediately communicated to our <hi rend="italic">chargé
                                                d’affaires</hi> at Paris, since the ambassador was
                                            absent. The telegram arrived at one o’clock in the
                                            morning. Without delaying a moment the <hi rend="italic"
                                                >chargé d’affaires</hi> went to the president of the
                                            council, Viviani, at that very undiplomatic hour. When
                                            he entered, the president turned pale and started back,
                                            feeling sure that only the decision of Italy to throw in
                                            her lot with Germany would have caused the Italian
                                            diplomatist to come to him at that hour; upon reading
                                            the telegram, the president could not restrain his
                                            emotion.</p>
                                        <p>[“] In less than half an hour Viviani had already ordered
                                            the mobilization of almost a million men whom France
                                            would otherwise have been obliged to keep upon the
                                            south-eastern frontier to protect herself from a
                                            possible attack on the part of Italy. That million of
                                            men arrested the advance of the Germans, won the battle
                                            of the Marne, and saved France from being crushed under
                                            the savage heel of German militarism. Had there been the
                                            least vacillation, the least hesitation on the part of
                                            Italy, had there been one Italian statesman who
                                            attempted to do one tenth part of what Bismarck did when
                                            he altered the words of the famous telegram of Ems, by
                                            that means bringing about the Franco-Prussian war,
                                            France would not have dared to withdraw a single man
                                            from the Italian frontier, and the history of the world
                                            would be differently written. Is there anyone who, after
                                            what I have said, can doubt that this action of Italy
                                            was the decisive factor in the war?” [Footnote in the

                                entire absence of imperialistic aims, made by the Italian government
                                in this pronouncement, may be accepted with confidence, for any
                                imperialistic policy would disastrously fail of support among the
                                vast majority of the Italian people. If the Italians ever suffered
                                from megalomania the disease was contracted from German contagion,
                                was of brief duration and has long since been cured. They have
                                traditions neither of Napoleonic conquest nor of British imperialism
                                to beacon them mistakenly into paths of unjust domination. In the

                                of enforcing peace conditions that will sow the seeds of future
                                conflict, the public opinion of Italy will be found to be on the
                                side of moderation, of conciliation and of fair play. Italy herself
                                will expect to make, as well as to receive, concessions in the
                                Adriatic in the establishment of boundaries suitable for naval
                                defence. In the adjustment of the economic situation in Asia Minor
                                Italy will be ready to support the policy of the open door, but if
                                spheres of influence are to be mapped out there she will expect fair
                                treatment from the other Great Powers; the question for her will be
                                not of quantity, but of proportion—that is, fair treatment
                                calculated to maintain her proportionate power and her prestige, and

                                of France toward Italy during the past months has been the subject
                                of much bitter comment even among the most Franco-phile Italians; it
                                may be due to administrative influences at the Quai d’Orsay rather
                                than to initiative on the part of the present French government, but
                                it is considered a logical continuation of that semi-hostile policy
                                toward Italy which France has followed during the past half-century
                                and which drove Italy into the Triple Alliance. As this subject will
                                be treated in one of the Memoranda which follow (cf. Part 2, Section
                                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>).),<note n="5" xml:id="d354fn5">Not

                                to note the fact that today France does not possess the confidence
                                of Italy. Certainly one of the problems of the Peace Conference will
                                be that of establishing so far as possible relations of mutual trust
                                between these two great Latin peoples—such relations being
                                indispensable as a guarantee of the future maintenance of European
                                peace.</p>
                            <p>Toward England Italy turns with greater confidence—and it is to be
                                noted that Italian friendship for England arouses French
                                jealousy—but it is to America that the Italian people look for
                                entire disinterestedness in the consideration of Italian interests.
                                Today (November 30, 1918) America occupies a unique position in
                                Italian public opinion. President <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                    >Wilson</persName> has placed the consideration of international
                                questions on high moral ground; American idealism is beginning to be
                                understood in Europe; and it is the belief in America’s sense of
                                absolute justice that has created among the Italian people the
                                expectation that through her efforts rather than through those of
                                any other of the Allies the Great Peace of the world can be made a
                                lasting peace.</p>

                                observer it may appear that harmony of views as to precisely what
                                Italy’s interests require, is wanting among Italians. In reality,
                                however, there are no differences of fundamental purpose or opinion.
                                Italian national unity must be completed. Italian boundaries such as
                                will insure strong defence by land and by sea must be secured.
                                Italy’s legitimate economic interests must be protected.</p>

                            <p>Elements of anti-Italian propaganda abroad have endeavored to make it
                                appear that Italy has changed her policy of late and reduced her
                                territorial claims. This is entirely false—manifestly false as will
                                appear from the following Memoranda. From the first Italy’s claims
                                have been based upon the three fundamental considerations just
                                stated, considerations which are based upon geographical and race
                                conditions which are not susceptible of change. Her claims today are
                                what they were four years ago, and the fine consistency of the
                                speeches of <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Baron Sonnino</persName>,
                                minister of foreign affairs during this entire period, bears witness
                                to a national consistency under circumstances of widely fluctuating
                                international fortunes, such as is possible only in a cause of which
                                the basis is international justice. The writer of these Memoranda
                                has interviewed at length many political leaders who have freely
                                criticised various phases of <persName corresp="#p_SBS1"
                                    >Sonnino</persName>’s conduct of foreign affairs, but their
                                views on the fundamental lines of Italy’s claims and interests are
                                identical with <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>’s

                            <p>The precise frontiers by which Italy’s commonly recognized rights and
                                interests may be secured, must be determined largely by technical
                                considerations—and their discussion demands at many points special

                                forth in the official pronouncement quoted, it is important to
                                review briefly <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>’s
                                declarations regarding Italian interests made during the past
                                eighteen months in speeches delivered before parliament. They will
                                serve to refute completely any charges of mutability in Italy’s
                                purposes, and may be considered as a proper point of departure for a
                                detailed examination of the grounds of Italy’s claims for the
                                completion of her national unity through a readjustment of her
                                boundaries to the north and east. On June 20, 1917 <persName

                                    <p>“If a lasting peace is to be assured, it is necessary that
                                        Italy obtain secure national frontiers—an indispensable
                                        condition for her full independence. Our national programme
                                        is the same as that proclaimed in 1859 and in 1866, namely
                                        the union and independence of the Italian people which they
                                        of their own free volition demand—and this is absolutely
                                        necessary if Italy is to prove in Europe a secure and
                                        permanent factor in the maintenance of peace and in the
                                        advancement of civilization.</p>
                                    <p>Far from us be any thought of oppression or subjection or
                                        humiliation of any race of any state, near or distant, great
                                        or small. Our aim is to cooperate in the establishment of
                                        the equilibrium of power which is the condition and the
                                        guarantee of reciprocal respect, and in bringing about
                                        mutual concessions—essential elements of liberty and equity
                                        in the society alike of individuals and of peoples.</p>
                                    <p>Our aspirations are, I repeat, for liberty and security, both
                                        for ourselves and for others. We have no desire to acquire
                                        frontiers that would constitute a menace to a neighbor or a
                                        peril to anyone, but simply frontiers that will serve as a
                                        bulwark to the independence of our Country and a guarantee
                                        of its pacific civic progress.”</p>

                                    <p>The Allied Nations have entered the war with the high ideal
                                        purpose of defending and re-establishing international
                                        justice and the rights of the peoples which have been so
                                        barbarously violated. But they cherish also their individual
                                        aims which, far from being inspired by imperialistic designs
                                        as has been malignly insinuated, look on the contrary toward
                                        the legitimate application of the general principles of
                                        international justice and of the rights and liberties of the
                                        peoples. France, victim together with Russia of that
                                        aggression of 1914 which has few parallels in the world’s
                                        history, seeks the recovery of the provinces which were
                                        violently torn from her in 1871. And Italy is fighting
                                        equally for the recovery of her own natural frontiers, for
                                        the liberation of her brothers oppressed under a foreign
                                        yoke, and to secure for herself in the Adriatic the
                                        conditions essential to her existence and to her legitimate

                                policy: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“An underhand campaign of foreign propaganda has attempted to
                                        insinuate that Italian aspirations are inspired by
                                        conceptions of imperialism, of anti-democracy, of
                                        anti-nationalism, etc. This is all absolutely false. Such
                                        insinuations have been possible only because of an absolute
                                        ignorance of real conditions. Our revindications from
                                        Austria are based on claims of ethnography and of legitimate
                                        defence by land and by sea. The ethnographical grounds are
                                        self-evident and are consecrated by the indomitable Italian
                                        spirit of our unredeemed provinces. And the grounds of
                                        legitimate defence by land and by sea are equally clear. In
                                        considering frontiers for defence, wherever one encounters a
                                        mixed population a just delimitation can be obtained only
                                        through mutual concessions and reciprocal sacrifices;
                                        otherwise conditions will be created containing the germs of
                                        future conflicts.</p>
                                    <p>It is with this conception that are inspired Italy’s
                                        revindications, which according to our firm conviction, are
                                        calculated to insure for the future that confident
                                        collaboration in the political and economic field which it
                                        is the vital interest alike of Italy and of the Jugo-Slav
                                        nationality to establish upon a solid foundation.</p>
                                    <p>We aspire only to that minimum of safety on our military and
                                        naval frontiers which is a postulate essential to liberty
                                        and political independence, rendering possible both normal
                                        disarmament and the pacific development of our resources and
                                        our business activities without constant preoccupation over
                                        the danger of surprise and attempts at domination on the
                                        part of our neighbors. We ask for no privileged situation
                                        from which to attack others, but simply for those conditions
                                        which are indispensable for our own reasonable safety.”</p>

                            <p>The favorite method in discussion adopted by those who would oppose
                                Italy’s national revindications is that of confusing the two claims
                                which <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> has here
                                clearly set forth as absolutely distinct, though both absolutely
                                essential for the future of Italian nationality. As <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> says, for Italy’s national
                                revindications “the ethnographical grounds are self-evident”; and
                                the “grounds of legitimate defence by land and by sea are equally
                                clear”. The grounds of defence, however, of necessity include the
                                annexation of some territory occupied by non-Italian peoples, and it
                                is by attacking these claims of Italian defence as if instead they
                                were claims of Italian ethnography, that Italy is misrepresented as
                                putting forth unjust pretensions and therefore as possessed of
                                imperialistic ambitions. One might as well attack the occupation of
                                the Panama Canal Zone by the United States on ethnographical
                                grounds, ignoring the fact that America’s claims to it are based in
                                no sense upon grounds of ethnography, but upon grounds of national
                                defence and upon grounds geographically imposed by considerations of
                                economic development.</p>
                            <p>The “unredeemed” European territory to which Italy lays claim may be
                                divided for convenience of treatment into four territorial sections,
                                of which the first comprises the Trentino and the Upper Adige. In
                                each of the four divisions, the consideration of national defence is
                                combined with the various other considerations of nationality, but
                                as national defence is separately treated at length in a later

                                consideration will be but briefly touched upon in the four divisions

                            <p>The Upper Adige and the Trentino occupy the upper and middle basins
                                of the Adige, an Italian river of about 250 miles in length, which
                                has its sources in the Rhaetian Alps and empties its waters into the
                                Gulf of Venice. The Upper Adige and the Trentino, though by Austria
                                separated as administratively distinct, form geographically one
                                region, of which the vital interests are geographically common. The
                                Upper Adige covers 7,280 square chilometres, the Trentino 6,356
                                square chilometres. Together they contain about 600,000 inhabitants,
                                of which some 410,000 are Italian by race, language and sentiment,
                                and 190,000 German. By the possession of this region Austria,
                                contrary to all natural laws, thrust a deep angular salient of its
                                political boundaries like a wedge into the Italian territory of
                                Lombardy and Venice, rendering impossible Italy’s sound military

                                Upper Adige-Trentino region, and of the region of the
                                Lombardo-Veneto. Geographically the most northern <pb n="425"

                                waters through the Danube into the Black Sea, from those flowing
                                south, emptying into the Gulf of Venice and the Adriatic Sea; the
                                division delineated by Nature is clear and absolute, the division
                                between two worlds differing in physical aspects, climate and trade
                                interests, and inhabited by two distinct races, distinct by blood,
                                language, tradition, character and sentiment. The impressions of the
                                traveller crossing the Alpine summits from the German side have been
                                well described by one of the most fervid apostles of Italy’s claims
                                to this region: “Whether the traveller approach from France, or from
                                Switzerland, or from the German and Slav countries, as soon as he
                                has crossed the crest of the Alps, whether by tunnel or under the
                                open sky, and begins to descend swiftly along the fast-flowing
                                rivers, he feels the same certainty in his soul—This is Italy—. No
                                sooner do the waters begin to flow to the south than the fair land
                                discloses herself, beautiful as some supernatural vision. These are
                                her vineyards and her flowers, her streams and her perfumes. The
                                mountains rear themselves less loftily, the valleys descend like
                                rays, the hills spread out towards the plain, the plain infinite and
                                remote is lost to view as it stretches towards the Adriatic. And
                                from this immense descent, from this flow of a thousand streams and
                                rivers towards the Italian sea, there presents itself before ones
                                eyes as before those of the mind, the unquestionable truth: The
                                whole extent of the Adige is Italian territory, even though from its
                                Alpine source to the hills of Verona the black and yellow banner of
                                the Hapsburgs may wave above it.”</p>

                                strategic region by Austria lies the chief explanation of the long
                                duration of the Triple Alliance—which was repeatedly renewed in
                                absolute violation of the general feeling of the Italian people.
                                Austria, a state of about fiftyone million inhabitants, would have
                                been, even without the advantage of this unnatural domination of
                                Italian territory, militarily much stronger than Italy, a nation of
                                about thirty-six million inhabitants; but by the possession of this
                                territory of the Upper Adige and the Trentino which contain numerous
                                mountain passes leading down into the plains of Lombardy and the
                                Veneto, Austria held the gates of Italy, and the latter was
                                completely at her mercy. The first sound line of defence for Italy
                                under these conditions was the Adige, and in case of a war
                                single-handed against Austria she would have been <pb n="426"

                                her position on this river, abandoning all of the Friuli and almost
                                all of the Veneto, comprising altogether about 20,000 square
                                chilometres containing 3,000,000 inhabitants—that is a fifteenth
                                part of her territory and a twelfth part of her population. Italy,
                                therefore, had only to choose between this perpetual peril of
                                invasion and her position in the Triple Alliance.</p>
                            <p>The natural frontier of Italy to the north, that determined by Nature
                                and offering the strongest line of military defence—strongest both
                                because of its geographical conformation and because it is the
                                shortest—is that which follows the highest ridge of the Alps, being,
                                as has been said, the watershed dividing the German streams flowing
                                to the north from the Italian streams flowing to the south; for the
                                most part it is the boundary by which the Austrians have generally
                                distinguished between the Nordtirol and the Südtirol. This natural
                                frontier of Italy extends from Monte Murtaro (above Bormio di
                                Valtellina) along the crest of the highest chain for a distance of
                                about 240 chilometres to Monte Paterno and is pierced by three
                                passes only, those of Rèsia (Reschen), the Brennero (Brenner) and
                                Dobbiaco (Toblach)—and by five foot paths. From the point of view of
                                military defence contrast this natural frontier with Italy’s present
                                political frontier, which breaks from the great chain at Monte
                                Murtaro, descends in an irregular line to Lake Garda, almost to
                                Verona, and then rambles off to the north and east along the lower
                                ridges of the Venetian Alps, with innumerable corrugations, until it
                                rejoins the great chain beneath Monte Paterno. This unfortunate
                                political frontier, which is 370 chilometres in length, is pierced
                                by forty-two passes and foot paths, among which are thirteen
                                important passes: the Stelvio (above Bormio), Tonale (above Edolo),
                                Ponte Caffaro (above Idro), Garda (above Peschiera), Borghetto
                                (above Verona), Pian delle Fugazze (above Schio), Val d’Arsa (above
                                Asiago), Primolano (above Bassano), Monte Coppolo (above
                                Fonzaso-Feltre), Caprile and Falcade (above Agordo), d’Alemagna and
                                Monte Piano (above Pieve di Cadore). The reality of the perpetual
                                menace which the possession of these numerous passes by a foreign
                                power constituted against Italy was proved in May 1916, when Austria
                                made her great Trentino offensive with half a million men, and
                                barely missed breaking through into the Venetian plain in the rear
                                of the Italian armies of the Isonzo.</p>
                            <p>Italy now claims in this region as a right her natural frontier of
                                the great chain in the Upper Adige, which she has recovered by the
                                valor of her armies—a frontier of 240 chilometres with only three
                                great gates in the high Alps to defend, in place of the old insecure
                                frontier of 370 chilometres with its thirteen great gates close upon
                                the plain.</p>
                            <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0497"/>
                            <p>Under Monte Paterno this natural frontier which Italy claims, joins
                                the existing political frontier of the Carnic Alps, and proceeds
                                eastward towards the northern limit of Julian Venetia. For about
                                seventy-five chilometres the existing political frontier coincides
                                almost perfectly with the natural defensible frontier of the Carnic
                                Alps, and only slight modifications would be required if this
                                frontier should be retained; for the last twenty-five chilometres,
                                however, beginning north-west of Moggio, the political frontier
                                abandons the natural frontier (at the double pass of Meledis) and
                                bends to the south-east leaving to Austria the whole of the upper
                                valley of the Fella, with Malborghetto. But the discussion of this
                                portion of Italy’s northern frontier more properly belongs to the
                                study of Julian Venetia (Part 1, section <hi rend="italic">a</hi>,

                            <p>It should be added here that some Italian military authorities argue
                                that the Carnic Alps do not form the real limits of Italy, and claim
                                that Italy’s new frontier should be fixed farther north to coincide
                                with the high ridge of the Tauern Alps, and should include the upper
                                basin of the Drave as far as Kreuz Ech and the Conca di Tarvis. But
                                this question may best be considered in the general study of
                                national land defence.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Population</hi>. Of the Italian population of
                                410,000 in the Trentino and Upper Adige, about 370,000 inhabit the
                                Trentino and about 40,000 the Upper Adige; in other words the
                                population of the Trentino is almost exclusively Italian, whereas in
                                the Upper Adige it is today only about one-fifth Italian. The
                                situation in the Upper Adige is therefore not dissimilar to that of
                                portions of Alsace-Lorraine, where German immigration and violence

                                Alsace-Lorraine. It should be kept in mind that Austria has had a
                                free hand in this region for a century and has used her domination
                                to Germanize in every manner possible, and to eliminate Italian
                                blood and sentiment—and she has aggravated her methods with
                                particular violence during the past ten years. She has allowed no
                                Italian schools in bilinguist cities and has absolutely deprived
                                thousands of Italian children of even elementary education in many
                                rural districts. She has violated her own constitution and prevented
                                her subjects of Italian race from voicing their <pb n="428"
                                    xml:id="pg_428" facs="0498"/>claims of redress for their
                                violated rights. If Italy were to adopt in the Upper Adige for ten
                                years the methods used there by Austria, during her hundred years of
                                occupation, it is not an exaggeration to say that the German
                                inhabitants of even the least Italian portion of that region would
                                no longer be in a majority.</p>
                            <p>But taking the Upper Adige even as it is, Italy’s claims to it appear
                                to be perfectly valid. Geographically—for reasons of military
                                defence and for necessities of economic life—the Upper Adige must be
                                considered as one with the Trentino; and so considered the
                                population of the entire region is more than two-thirds indisputably
                                Italian—namely about 410,000 out of a total of 600,000.</p>
                            <p>If one institutes a comparison between these figures and those of
                                Alsace-Lorraine the contrast is striking, for after nearly a
                                half-century of German domination in the geographically French
                                provinces of the Rhine, only a fourth, or at most a third of the
                                population has remained French in language and customs.</p>
                            <p>A similar comparison might also be made between the Upper

                                <hi rend="italic">Language</hi>. The language of the entire Trentino
                                is Italian. Of the 13,477 Germans inhabiting this region, 5,000
                                inhabit the ten villages: Provés, Lauregno, S. Felice, Senale (in
                                Val di Non), Tródena and Anterivo (in Val d’Avisio), Luserna (on the
                                southern boundary close to the Sette Comuni Vicentini), and
                                Fierozzo, Frassilongo and Palú (in the Alta Valle della Férsina).
                                These German villages are all bilinguist, their inhabitants speaking
                                Italian as well as their German dialect. The other 8,500 Germans are
                                scattered throughout the region, being government officials, or
                                soldiers, or persons dependent upon them for their living.</p>
                            <p>In the Upper Adige the prevailing language is German, although in
                                several districts it is Italian, and in others the inhabitants are
                                bilinguist. The Italian population is thus distributed, according to
                                statistics compiled by <persName>Antonio Toniolo</persName> and
                                published in the <hi rend="italic">Archivio per l’Alto Adige</hi>,
                                Vol. 11: in the city of Bolzano 5,370; in the Capitanato di Bolzano
                                11,916; in the Capitanato di Merano 7,732; in the Capitanato di
                                Silandro 417; in the Capitanato di Brunico 5,908—a total of 32,000.
                                The remaining 8,000 or 9,000 Italians are not Austrian citizens and
                                are scattered throughout the region. To these 40,000 Italian
                                inhabitants may be added some 15,000 Italian temporary emigrants
                                which are not included in the preceding statistics, but which, prior
                                to the war were employed for eight or nine months of each year in
                                the Upper Adige.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Industry and Trade</hi>. The natural commercial
                                outlet for the Trentino and Upper Adige is the Lombardo-Venetian
                                plain; indeed the movement of trade for this mountain region has
                                been geographically imposed by Nature with peculiar rigor. For the
                                Upper Adige <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0499"/>one document
                                may suffice to illustrate general trade conditions. In 1864 the
                                Chamber of Commerce of Bolzano, traditionally the principal
                                commercial organization of the whole region of the Upper Adige,
                                voted to demand from the central government separation from the
                                province of Innsbruck and union with the Veneto, its natural market.
                                There was no political motive in the demand, for all the territory
                                involved was then under Austrian rule; the motive was purely
                                commercial and the conditions which inspired it were
                                geographical—the same in 1864 as they are today, for geography does
                                not change. Two years later the Venetian plain passed to the
                                dominion of Italy, while the mountain region remained to Austria;
                                political considerations thus entered to raise an artificial
                                barrier—the unnatural Austro-Italian frontier of 1866—between the
                                Upper Adige and its natural market and to obstruct commercial action
                                and development; however, many of the products of the region,
                                notwithstanding the difficulties artificially imposed, insisted upon
                                finding their geographical outlet—the Veneto.</p>
                            <p>Principal among these products is lumber, which naturally follows the
                                course of the rivers, all of them Italian rivers, on which it floats
                                down to its geographically imposed market—the Lombardo-Venetian
                                plain. Forests are among the richest resources of both the Upper
                                Adige and the Trentino, covering nearly 40% of the territory of the
                                former and 48% of that of the latter, whereas in Italy forests are
                                relatively scarce and lumber is in great request. In the Trentino
                                alone the annual production of lumber is valued at over four million
                                crowns, almost all of which has been exported to Italy. Had not the
                                Austrian government opposed obstinately every project of
                                construction of roads and railways connecting the Trentino with the
                                Lombardo-Veneto, production and importation could have been largely
                                increased to the mutual advantage of both the mountain regions and
                                of the Italian plain.</p>
                            <p>Cattle-raising, which is carried on as one of the most important
                                interests in the Upper Adige and the Trentino, has always been
                                closely allied with the interests of the rest of northern Italy, but
                                during the last fifty years the unnatural Austro-Italian frontier
                                and the grazing and commercial obstructions imposed by Austria have
                                greatly hampered the cattle-raisers in their affairs. For centuries
                                the graziers were accustomed in the hot season to drive their herds
                                from the Lombardo-Venetian plain up into the mountains of the
                                Trentino and the Upper Adige, and as the winter approached to bring
                                them back again to the plain. By the artificial territorial division
                                of 1866, and the consequent tariff and sanitary restrictions,
                                Austria gravely injured the grazing interests of those regions—an
                                injury which the annexation of the Trentino and the Upper Adige to
                                Italy will now rectify for the future. In 1910 the Upper Adige <pb
                                    n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0500"/>possessed 112,000 head of
                                cattle, 75,000 sheep, 21,000 swine, 7,500 horses; the Trentino
                                98,000 head of cattle, 26,000 sheep, 38,000 goats, 27,000 swine,
                                9,000 horses; in the Trentino at this date the number of sheep and
                                goats was less than half that possessed thirty years earlier.
                                Grazing in these regions can be vastly augmented.</p>
                            <p>Another great benefit which annexation will secure to the Trentino
                                and the Upper Adige is that of industrial development. Water power
                                constitutes a source of immense wealth which under Austrian
                                domination has been almost totally neglected. In the Upper Adige and
                                the Trentino it reaches 43.5 horse power per square chilometer,
                                which is the maximum of all the territory of the Alps. In
                                Switzerland it reaches only 36 horse power. At present only 66,000
                                horse power is utilized in the Upper Adige and the Trentino
                                together, while 494,000 remains to be employed. These figures are
                                based upon Austrian statistics. In the past the firm and deliberate
                                policy of Austria has been to obstacle through defective means of
                                communication and in every other way possible the industrial
                                development of this region, to the benefit of the other provinces of
                                her Empire. An additional reason for this iniquitous policy was the
                                aversion of the Austrian government to the creation of industrial
                                centres which would establish masses of workmen close to her
                                unnatural boundaries in Italy.</p>
                            <p>An increase in resources of water-power will be of great advantage to
                                Italy, a country in which the lack of coal has always been a serious
                                handicap to industrial development.</p>
                            <p>The wine-growing interests of the Upper Adige and the Trentino are
                                most important. In the Alto Adige the average annual production of
                                wine (1902–1911) was 328,000 hectolitres; in the Trentino the annual
                                average (1907–1910) was 942,000 hectolitres. Annexation to Italy
                                will greatly injure these interests unless immediate action is taken
                                by the Italian government to facilitate exportation. The wine
                                produced in this region is in considerable part of an inferior
                                quality which has hitherto found a good market in Austria, Germany
                                and Switzerland, but which could not compete with the finer wines in
                                Italy.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand silk-growing will greatly benefit by the annexation
                                to Italy, which has always been the great market for Trentino
                                cocoons, of which the annual production has amounted in value to ten
                                million crowns.</p>
                            <p>Fruit-growing interests are also important and these should find a
                                market in Italy equal to that previously enjoyed in the Central
                                Empires.</p>
                            <p>Mining resources are considerable in both the Upper Adige and the
                                Trentino and the improved means of communication which this region
                                should obtain from Italy, which has nothing to fear from their <pb
                                    n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0501"/>construction, will
                                certainly lead to an important revival of mining development, which
                                was languishing under Austrian domination.</p>

                            <p>The readjustment of colonial boundaries in Africa is a subject which
                                during the progress of the war has been excluded from public
                                discussion in all the Allied countries, as if by common consent.
                                This general silence upon African post-bellum problems is in itself
                                eloquent testimony to the difficulties which their solution is
                                certain to encounter, difficulties which the Allies have wisely
                                preferred to face <hi rend="underline">after</hi> the defeat of the
                                common enemy; upon African problems the Powers, in view of their
                                individual interests often conflicting, are bound to disagree, and a
                                general settlement can be reached only by mutual concessions.</p>
                            <p>Italy’s colonial interests in Africa are in extent secondary to those
                                of England and France, but as bearing upon her own future they are
                                of vital importance to her; Italy’s African interests are those of
                                national defence, of equilibrium of power in the Mediterranean, and
                                of economic development.</p>
                            <p>Italy’s earliest ventures in African colonization were disastrous and
                                they were so because they were in advance of their time, undertaken
                                before the economic life of the nation was such as to require
                                colonial expansion, before economic conditions were such as to
                                ensure national support. Italy’s colonial policy was a policy of
                                national foresight and of faith in the future, but thirty-three
                                years ago this policy was beyond the economic strength of the
                                country and in advance of national opinion. It then seemed
                                imperialistic; it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> imperialistic except
                                to the eye of faith; and imperialism did not then, as it does not
                                now, meet with the approval of the liberty loving Italian
                                people.</p>
                            <p>But economic conditions have undergone a remarkable transformation in
                                Italy within the last three decades. In the twenty years which
                                preceded the occupation of Libya (1911) Italy made greater progress
                                in foreign commerce than any other country in the world—the United
                                States and Germany not excepted.</p>
                            <p>Her progress in sanitary improvements and regulations has been
                                equally noteworthy and has, furthermore, exerted a profound
                                influence upon social and economic conditions. In a half-century
                                dating from 1863 the death-rate in Italy has been brought down from
                                3 <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0502"/>per cent, to about 2 per
                                cent., a decrease representing the saving of 250,000 lives annually.
                                The natural effect of this enormous saving has been to bring about a
                                much larger increase in the population of Italy in late years, the
                                excess of births over deaths now amounting to about 400,000 a

                                that the growth of Italy’s economic resources has been unable to
                                meet the consequent growth of labor, and extensive emigration has
                                been the necessary result. In 1894 emigrants numbered 225,323
                                according to official statistics; in the three years 1911–1913, they
                                averaged about 675,000; emigration tripled in twenty years.<note

                            <p>Italy claims that, as a nation which exports man-power on such a vast
                                scale, she has a right to make provisions by which this current of
                                emigration may be directed in part to territory under her own
                                control, in order that she herself may share in the profit of her
                                emigrants’ industry. Colonization based on legitimate emigration is
                                sound democratic national policy—not imperialism. The laborer brings
                                prosperity to the country to which he devotes his energies; he does
                                not exploit the land for an absentee investor, but he himself adds
                                to its value by his own labor.</p>
                            <p>With profitable colonies in Africa possessed of rational political
                                boundaries that will offer guarantees of sound economic development,
                                Italy believes that she can retain for herself a part of her
                                emigration, thereby vastly strengthening her own economic position,
                                while at the same time benefiting and enriching the regions of
                                Africa that come under her control. And in the democratic character
                                of her colonization, in the importation into her colonies of her own
                                manpower, she will notably differentiate her colonial policy from
                                that of France and England. The possibilities of Italian
                                colonization in North Africa may be judged from a glance at the
                                population of the French colony of Tunis, where there were 109,000
                                Italians in 1911 against 46,000 Frenchmen.</p>
                            <p>But Italy’s aspirations to a betterment of her colonial position in
                                Africa are derived not only from necessities of emigration, but also
                                from considerations imposed by her healthy economic development (cf.
                                Part 1. Section <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. Introduction),<note n="9"
                                    xml:id="d354fn9">Not found in Department files.</note> and from
                                the necessity of strengthening her naval defence on the south and of
                                maintaining the balance of power in the Mediterranean. It is to be
                                noted that a considerable portion of Italy’s African claims
                                calculated to secure these ends are only claims for the recovery of
                                what she once already possessed <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433"
                                    facs="0503"/>in the earlier years of her colonial policy. The
                                new territory requested adjoins the colonies already under her
                                control, so that the result will be the logical consolidation of her
                                African power. The following confidential Memorandum, which has been
                                furnished to the writer for the use of the American peace delegates,
                                under pledge of the strictest reserve and with the assurance that it
                                represents not only the views of the Italian Minister of the
                                Colonies, but also the official position of the Prime Minister and
                                of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sets forth clearly the
                                imperative considerations of the balance of power; the figures given
                                in this Memorandum also reveal the comparative moderation of Italy’s
                                claims.</p>
                            <p>For England the Mediterranean is a thoroughfare by which to reach her
                                colonies and a highway for her commerce; for France the
                                Mediterranean coast is one of her three bases for her sea-power; for
                                Italy the Mediterranean is all, and she must see that the balance of
                                power is maintained there and the liberty of the seas assured, or
                                her own independence of action is lost.</p>
                            <p>As to the character of the colony of Libya, it should be borne in
                                mind that Tripoli lies at the very threshold of Italy. From Syracuse
                                the distance to Tripoli is the same as that to Rome and less than
                                half of that to Turin; from Naples the distance to Tripoli is a
                                little more than that to Turin. If the Tripolitania is eventually
                                widely settled by Italians, this vast African territory will become
                                almost as integral a part of the Kingdom of Italy as the islands of
                                Sicily and Sardinia.</p>
                            <p>The proposed readjustment of the boundaries of Libya would add some
                                600,000 square chilometres to that colony, and about 50,000
                                inhabitants; while the acquisition of Giubaland, English Somaliland
                                (which has been neglected and half-abandoned by the English), French
                                Somaliland and the Farsan islands would further add to Italy’s
                                possessions 309,000 square chilometres and about 677,500
                                inhabitants. In all Italy would hold in Africa 2,667,609 square
                                chilometres occupied by about 2,305,500 inhabitants. This area is
                                little more than a quarter of that held by the French before the
                                war; it is less than half of that held by England before the war and
                                less than a quarter of that which England will hold if she retains
                                possession of Germany’s African colonies captured in the course of
                                the war; the African population of Italy’s colonies would be less
                                than a fifteenth of that of either the English or the French
                                colonies before the war.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore the boundaries established by the proposed rectifications
                                are those delimitated by geographical features and by considerations
                                imperatively imposed by trade routes, and it is claimed that they
                                will eliminate the causes for future international disputes and
                                conflicts.</p>

                                quarter of a century of perseverance in colonial and diplomatic
                                effort which had been directed to the end of bringing all Ethiopia,
                                with the consent of England and France which had duly acknowledged
                                receipt of our communication regarding the protectorate, within the
                                sphere of Italy’s action, reuniting Abyssinia in a politico-economic

                                south; another objective was that of obtaining the occupation of the
                                Sudanese province of the Taca (Cassala).</p>
                            <p>But aside from Italy’s historical claims upon this territory on
                                colonial and diplomatic grounds, this portion of East Africa

                            <p>It is equitable that among the nations which have borne the burdens
                                of the war together, any advantages accruing from the war should be
                                distributed in proportion to the contribution which each according

                                outline of events will suffice. At the outbreak of the world war
                                Italy on August 1, 1914 declared her neutrality, and on May 24, 1915
                                herself entered the conflict; on every occasion she has, within the
                                limits of her power, put forth her full strength in assistance of
                                the Allies, particularly in the most difficult phases of the war;
                                our fleet, by preventing the Austrian fleet from issuing forth from
                                the Adriatic Sea, has indirectly contributed to the safe transport
                                of troops and supplies along the African coasts; the occupation of
                                Libya carried out by Italy at a heavy sacrifice of blood and
                                treasure and maintained in the face of a Tripolitan rebellion
                                fomented by Turks and Germans, has prevented the enemy from
                                manoeuvring from an otherwise secure Mediterranean base against all
                                three of the Allies—Italy, France and England; the effective watch
                                kept by Italy in Eritrea and in Somaliland on the confines of
                                Ethiopia which was a centre of Austro-Turco-German agitation and
                                intrigue, notwithstanding the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> of
                                September 27, 1917 which overthrew the Ethiopian sovereign Ligg

                                Ethiopia and Arabia from having dangerous consequences—and this
                                while France and England were fighting also in Africa in order to
                                possess themselves of Germany’s colonies there, and while Italy had

                                lasting and shall correspond to the high ethical ends for which

                                himself, it is necessary for us to foresee and avoid all possible
                                future disagreements among the Allies of today, in order that these
                                may remain allies of tomorrow, reestablishing upon new foundations
                                future reciprocal good relations of peace and alliance in Africa as
                                well as in Europe, eliminating all elements which may give rise to
                                disagreements and conflicts.</p>
                            <p>In order to reach this end the most efficacious means is that of

                                and allied powers, and this may be done through the establishment of
                                colonial possessions having clearly defined boundaries and
                                constituting a homogeneous whole, organic and independent.</p>
                            <p>As France in the possession of Morocco, Algiers and Tunis has one

                                beginning with Egypt in the Mediterranean and extending (thanks to

                                Cape Colony; and as both of these Powers will still further round
                                out their African dominions; thus it is only right that Italy also
                                should, as well as her Allies, secure for herself an analogous,
                                sound colonial position.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">a</hi>). The Italian colonies of East Africa,
                                Eritrea and Somaliland (including the protectorates of North
                                Somaliland, that is of Obbia and of the Migiurtini) are situated
                                respectively to the north and south of Ethiopia which in itself
                                constitutes the great economic hinterland. Contiguous to Eritrea to
                                the south of the province is the French protectorate of the coast of
                                the Somali (Gibuti); contiguous to Italian Somaliland
                                (protectorates) to the north is English Somaliland (Zeila); and
                                contiguous to Italian Somaliland (Benadir) to the south is Giubaland
                                (Chisimajo).</p>
                            <p>In consequence Ethiopia is shut in to the west and south-west by the
                                line of the Anglo-Italian protocols of March 24 (mouths of the
                                Giuba-Italian Somaliland) and of April 15, 1891 (Ras Casar-Eritrea),
                                and to the north, east and south-east by Eritrea, by French
                                Somaliland, by English Somaliland and by Italian Somaliland. It is
                                therefore clear that in order to make a homogeneous, organic,
                                independent block of Italy’s possessions around Ethiopia, it is
                                necessary only that the protectorate of French Somaliland which
                                extends along the coast, together with English Somaliland and
                                Giubaland be added to Italy’s two colonies, and that Ethiopia be put
                                under the exclusive influence of Italy.</p>
                            <p>From France and England would be requested the revision of the
                                convention of London of December 13, 1906 for Ethiopia with return
                                to the dispositions of the Italo-Britannic protocols of March 24 and
                                April 15, 1891 and of May 5, 1894, which put Ethiopia within the
                                exclusive sphere of influence of Italy which would naturally respect
                                Ethiopia’s integrity.</p>
                            <p>From France would be requested the cession of the French protectorate
                                over the Somaliland coast (Gibuti) and of the railway to Addis
                                Abeba; and from England the cession of English Somaliland and
                                Giubaland.</p>
                            <p>Special agreements with France and England would fix respectively
                                Italy’s obligations for the cession of the railway
                                Gibuti-Addis-Abeba, for facilitations to France in the establishment
                                of a French naval station on the route to Madagascar and to Tonkin,
                                for guarantees to England regarding the Ethopian waters flowing into
                                the Nile, and <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0509"/>for the
                                regulation of all other necessary relations between the three
                                Powers.</p>
                            <p>France and England would find special compensations for themselves in
                                the political readjustment of other regions in Africa.</p>
                            <p>The acquisition by Italy of the territory of Gibuti and of the only
                                railway penetrating into Ethiopia, Gibuti-Addis-Abeba, will furnish
                                the fulcrum of the readjustment of Italy’s colonial interests in
                                East Africa; for Gibuti is the only port by which supplies of arms
                                and ammunition can enter Ethiopia and it is therefore, as it has
                                been hitherto, a permanent peril for our two colonies, Eritrea and
                                Somaliland (especially for the first of these) and for the English
                                possessions of the Sudan, and a perpetual cause of friction for
                                Italy and also for England with Ethiopia itself and with France, and
                                hence a permanent source, present and future, of disturbance in the
                                good relations between the Allied Powers, as well as an impediment
                                to the free development of our colonization, and to the economic
                                growth of our two colonies within their boundaries and beyond in the
                                territory of Ethiopia.</p>
                            <p>By the acquisition of Giubaland Italy would come into possession of
                                Chisimajo, the only port, properly so called, on the long stretch of
                                its possessions on the Indian Ocean from Guardafui to the mouths of
                                the Giuba, namely about 1,700 chilometres, a port which, indeed, as
                                early as 1886 was ceded by the Sultan of Zanzibar to Italy, but
                                which was later lost through the complications of political
                                events.</p>
                            <p>By the acquisition of British Somaliland, and thereby of the ports of
                                Zeila, Bulhar and Dongareta, Italy would complete her possessions,
                                controlling all the outlets from Abyssinia together with Gibuti,
                                Oboe, Tagiura (now French) Massaua, Assab, Alula, Obbia and the
                                ports of Benadir (Italian) and Chisimajo (now English).</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">b</hi>). Italy being one of the Mussulman Powers
                                bordering on the Red Sea cannot remain indifferent to the question
                                of the equilibrium of power in the Red Sea and of the political
                                conditions of Arabia which faces Eritrea.</p>
                            <p>We ask therefore that no Power shall occupy Arabia, that commerce and
                                commercial penetration be free, that the Holy Places of Islam in
                                Higiaz be in Mussulman hands and that the Farsan islands upon the
                                coast of the Asir be occupied by Italy.</p>
                            <p>

                                disturbed to the damage of Italy by the Anglo-French agreements of
                                March 21, 1899 regarding the Libyan hinterland, and that our two
                                colonies there be given a chance to breathe, we ask for the benefit
                                of Tripolitania in order to establish communications between the
                                three Italian oases, Ghadames, Ghat and Tummo, that France grant to
                                us the principal caravan route between Ghadames and Ghat, free

                                route Ghadames-Fort Polignac-Ghat, possession of the route from Ghat

                                zones occupied by France.</p>
                            <p>From England we ask, for the benefit of Cyrenaica, a rational
                                boundary line on the side of Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan—a
                                boundary starting from Ras Gebel Sollum and which shall include
                                within the territory of Cyrenaica not only the oasis of Cufra
                                already recognized by England as pertaining to Italy, but also the
                                oasis of Giarabub, which is now claimed by Egypt notwithstanding the
                                fact that it contains the Holy Places of the Senussi brotherhood
                                which has its seat in Cyrenaica.</p>
                            <p rend="center">5.</p>
                            <p>France is a country of about forty million inhabitants occupying an
                                area of 536,464 square chilometres; England (The United Kingdom) is
                                a country of about forty-six million inhabitants occupying an area
                                of 314,433 square chilometres; Italy contains about thirty-six
                                million inhabitants occupying an area of 286,610 square chilometres.
                                The simple statement of these figures will be sufficient to make it
                                clear that Italy’s African possessions are altogether inferior to
                                what she should have in proportion to her own area and population;
                                even before the conquest of Germany’s colonies, French possessions
                                in Africa covered an area of 9,253,084 square chilometres with a
                                population of about 35,590,000; English possessions (exclusive of
                                Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan) 5,676,679 square chilometres
                                with a population of about 36,430,000; Italian possessions 1,758,609
                                square chilometres with a population of about 1,578,000.</p>
                            <p>With the addition of the new territory which would come to Italy
                                through the acquisition of French Somaliland, British Somaliland and
                                Giubaland and the Farsan islands and through the rectification of
                                the borders of Libya, Italy’s increase of territory would amount to
                                about 909,000 square chilometres with a population of about 725,500,
                                making Italy’s African total 2,667,609 square chilometres with
                                2,305,500 inhabitants—figures which indicate an enormous
                                disproportion in comparison with those of France and England. This
                                disproportion would become even more accentuated by the annexation
                                of Germany’s colonies by these two Powers. England by the
                                acquisition of the Togo and of the Camerun in part, of German
                                South-west Africa and German East Africa would, if one includes
                                Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (and if one excludes the
                                populations of the Camerun and the Togo which cannot be estimated)
                                reach an African colonial area of 10,787,279 square chilometres with
                                a population of 58,680,000.</p>
                            <p>France with a part of the Togo and of the Camerun, of which the
                                population cannot be estimated, would reach an area of 9,975,084
                                square chilometres with a population of 35,590,000.</p>

                            <p>The difference in possessions in favor of France and of England when
                                compared with Italy shows France in possession of 7,307,475 square
                                chilometres in Africa more than Italy with 33,284,500 inhabitants in
                                excess of those dwelling in Italy’s possessions; whereas England’s
                                possessions surpass Italy’s by 8,119,670 square chilometres and
                                56,374,500 inhabitants. These figures are approximate, but very
                                eloquent.</p>

                            <p>Given these facts, and without taking into consideration the
                                advantages to be derived by France and England through other
                                extensions of their territories in Asia, the solution which Italy
                                proposes—namely some slight advantages for Libya and for its free
                                development, together with the union of French Somaliland and of
                                English Somaliland and Giubaland to its two colonies of Eritrea and
                                Somalia, and the exclusive sphere of influence in Ethiopia for
                                Italy—is seen to be for the most part no more than a just
                                revendication of long years of colonial activities and of earlier
                                diplomatic agreements laboriously secured; it provides for a logical
                                political and economic colonial settlement, eliminating for the
                                future all causes of jealousy such as has been several times
                                exhibited by France in the past, and removing possibilities of
                                conflict and disagreement between the allied Powers in Africa;
                                furthermore it permits Italy, a nation possessed of a rapidly
                                increasing population, to consolidate its resources, procuring for
                                itself the necessary raw materials, augmenting its production,
                                acquiring its own economic independence and the military security of
                                its colonies.</p>
                            <p>“It provides in general for a territorial settlement of Italy’s
                                colonial dominions within the geographical limits best adapted to
                                the economic development of its present colonies, and it provides
                                guarantees against the territorial expansion of other Powers such as
                                would compromise the development and safety of Italy’s
                                colonies.”</p>
                            <p>This is the programme of Italian public opinion.</p>
                            <p>If this programme should not be realized, Italy, after her colossal
                                sacrifices made for the war, and after the treasures of blood and of
                                money expended in Africa, would come out of the conflict reduced in
                                strength and deprived of the means for developing the potent
                                energies of her national life, which counts little more than half a
                                century but which looks with deep faith to the future.</p>
                            <p>A solution of “imperialism” with an appetite for dominion is not
                                asked, but simply an equitable solution of equilibrium required by
                                the necessities of life, of development, of lasting peace—a solution
                                which will permit Italy to labor and to prosper without doing injury
                                to anyone.</p>

                                of Fiume is one of the most complex and most delicate which will be
                                presented at the Peace Conference. The population of the city in an
                                overwhelming majority is Italian by blood, language, character and
                                sentiment. But out of regard for the economic necessities of another
                                proposed nationality, Italy renounced her rights to Fiume in the
                                Treaty of London of 1915.<note n="23" xml:id="d356fn23">Great

                                </note> At that time Russia advocated the creation of two

                                speaking, of the catholic Slavs, of which Croatia would have
                                furnished the major region with Fiume as its port; the other, <pb

                                readjustment of European nationalities is proposed in quite a
                                different combination, providing for the creation of a united
                                Jugo-Slav state, to which the possession of Fiume is no longer
                                essential as an outlet in the Adriatic; the proposed Jugo-Slav
                                state, which will include Croatia, will possess an abundance of
                                other ports in this same sea, notably Spalato and Cattaro, which
                                will be more than sufficient to care for all the commercial needs
                                toward which the most sanguine Jugo-Slav can aspire. It would seem,
                                therefore, to be no longer necessary to violate the great national
                                principle of ethnography in the case of Fiume. This is the point of
                                view of the vast majority of the inhabitants of Fiume, who protest
                                against being sacrificed without reason to what they claim can now
                                be considered only as Jugo-Slav imperialism. Their spokesman is the
                                delegate plenipotentiary of the city of Fiume, Doctor <persName>Gino
                                    Antoni</persName>, who after an interview with the Italian Prime

                                passionate declarations of the population of Fiume at this critical
                                hour gain additional significance when viewed in the light of the
                                city’s history. The origin of Fiume (the ancient Tarsatica) dates
                                from the times of the Roman Empire and marks the eastern boundary of
                                Roman Italy, as is shown by a vallum of which the ruins still
                                remain. The city and its territory have never belonged integrally to
                                Croatia, and only for nineteen years, from 1848 to 1867, were they
                                subjected forcibly against their will to Croatian domination. In
                                1766 Fiume, which was always a <hi rend="italic">libero comune
                                    italiano</hi> (from 1526 a free port) was annexed by the Empress
                                Maria Theresa to Hungary through Croatia; but only three years
                                later, in consequence of fiery protests from the inhabitants of
                                Fiume, the imperial diploma of annexation was modified to the effect
                                that Fiume be annexed directly to Hungary as <hi rend="italic"

                                        therefore continued to hold until October 1918.</p>

                                have been rapid and dramatic. During the night of October 28 the
                                Hungarian authorities fled from Fiume. On the morning of the 30th. a
                                Croatian government established itself at Fiume taking possession of
                                the city in the name of the National Council of Zagabria which three
                                days before had arbitrarily declared Fiume an inalienable part of
                                the new Jugo-Slav state (without Fiume’s consent). On that same day
                                the Italians of Fiume in open revolt against the Croatian government

                                municipality and that afternoon acclaimed by a monster procession
                                (estimated at 20,000 people) which paraded the streets carrying
                                Italian banners: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>This Proclamation was issued, it should be borne in mind, before the
                                completion of Italy’s great victories over the armies of the
                                Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was carried to Trieste overland by
                                patriots of Fiume at great personal risk, and from Trieste to Venice
                                by these same men by sea under cannon fire.</p>
                            <p>At the urgent request brought by these Fiumani a small Italian naval
                                squadron under Admiral Renier left Venice at once for Fiume with
                                orders to “protect Italians and the interests of Italy”. This
                                squadron has since remained in the port of Fiume, while Jugo-Slav
                                troops occupy the city. The situation is very strained; the Italian
                                flag has been insulted by the Slavs, but afterward saluted by them
                                under pressure from the Italian admiral; the Jugo-Slav flag has been
                                torn down by the Fiumani, and then raised again with proper honors.
                                Both Italians and Slavs, conscious of the fact that the eyes of the
                                world are fixed upon all such delicate international situations as
                                theirs, and that acts of violence and indiscretion will prejudice
                                the future claims of those who commit them, are both making
                                strenuous efforts at moderation—efforts for the continuation of
                                which every care should be exercised.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Population</hi>. Twenty years ago eighty per cent,
                                of the population of Fiume and its territory was Italian. In 1912,
                                according to Hungarian statistics, which certainly do not err in
                                favor of Italy, fifty-eight per cent, of the population was Italian,
                                namely 30,000 in a population of 52,000; of the remaining forty-two
                                per cent. 7,000 were Hungarians, 13,000 Slavs (namely Croatians,
                                Servians, Slovenes and Slovaks) and 2,000 of miscellaneous
                                nationalities.</p>
                            <p>In 1880 the Hungarians numbered but 379; the recent rapid increase in
                                their numbers has been largely due to the importation of government
                                employees, and to the adoption of various other artificial means to
                                which the Hungarian government had recourse in its efforts to
                                Hungarianize the city. The Hungarians in Fiume are not a stable but
                                a shifting population.</p>
                            <p>The Slav population is also in very considerable part a growth of
                                recent years, particularly of the last ten years. The Slavs are
                                employed largely in the menial occupations, being longshore-men,
                                cab-drivers, servants, unskilled workmen, etc. But very few of them
                                vote in the elections (perhaps one hundred in all); many of them
                                have not taken out papers of citizenship; hardly any have an
                                interest in civic affairs; the Slavs feel and represent little
                                indeed of the civic life of Fiume.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Language</hi>. The language generally spoken in
                                the city is Italian—the accent resembling the Venetian. Both
                                Hungarian and Slav inhabitants of Fiume are for the most part
                                bilinguists and speak Italian.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Economic Considerations</hi>. The economic life of
                                Fiume is vigorous and rapidly increasing: in 1911 its port imports
                                amounted to 184,928,228 crowns in value, and its exports to
                                185,884,954 crowns. Of the exports a value of 25,945,751 crowns went
                                to Italy, that is an amount more than double that sent to any other
                                country. In imports Italy stood third on Fiume’s list, being
                                surpassed by the East Indies and the United States.</p>
                            <p>In contrast with these figures are those of Croatia’s portion of the
                                total commercial transactions of Fiume—imports and exports together;
                                in 1912 Croatia’s portion amounted to only four per cent. of the
                                total.</p>
                            <p>A very important commercial consideration in the future destiny of
                                Fiume is that of its rivalry with Trieste. If both cities are held
                                by the same country this rivalry can be justly regulated to the
                                advantage of the two ports themselves and to the hinterland which
                                they both serve, namely to German Austria, Bohemia, Hungary and the
                                Jugo-Slavs. But if they are held by two different states, a
                                commercial war between them, with differential railway rates etc.
                                will be inevitable and permanent, and will be a source of future
                                international <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0517"/>irritation.
                                The two cities have been well described as being from an economic
                                point of view, one and indivisible.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Island of Veglia</hi>. With the destiny of Fiume
                                is bound up that of the Island of Veglia, with which its local
                                commerce is closely associated, and of which the population is 86
                                per cent. Italian.</p>

                                <persName>Speranza</persName> has been doing work of this kind for
                                the Embassy for over a year. He is an American gentleman whose
                                father was an Italian, and was for years a professor at Columbia
                                University and, as I recall it, at Yale also. He is a writer of
                                ability and a close and thoughtful student of Italian politics, and
                                although I do not always agree with him in his views, and
                                deductions, I always respect his views and know that they are those
                                of a man who is not only thoroughly reliable but in a certain way
                                better informed, perhaps, on these subjects than any other American
                                in Italy. I may add that he is as absolutely American in every
                                respect as you or I.</p>
                            <p>So much by way of introduction.</p>
                            <p>The most interesting elements in the situation here, since the
                                signing of the armistice, are the, perhaps not unnatural, but
                                certainly very changed tone of the Italian press regarding Italy’s
                                claims and rights along the northern and eastern Adriatic, and a
                                certain tone which I will not term imperialistic, but has a tendency
                                in that direction; secondly, the sub-current of feeling against
                                France because of her alleged opposition to Italian ideas regarding
                                the regions mentioned and her alleged part in stirring up opposition
                                to Italy therein. It is said by many persons here that France
                                instigated the Jugo-Slavs along the eastern Adriatic to seize the
                                Austrian ships and mount their flags on them; to organize Jugo-Slav
                                municipalities in cities along that coast and declare themselves
                                units of the Jugo-Slav Government in process of formation, or as
                                they claim, actually formed, and in general to resist Italy.</p>
                            <p>Without undertaking to go into the merits of what territories will be
                                eventually assigned to one or the other, it is not unnatural that
                                the Italians should feel that the sudden change within twenty-four
                                hours on the part of a lot of Austrian subjects who were engaged in
                                warfare against Italy to a body who termed themselves Allies and
                                take possession not only of ships but of important points which must
                                fall immediately into Italy’s hands as the result of her victories,
                                is not wholly a patriotic move, but is also a political move to
                                deprive her of the fruits of her victories.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the Italian idea, as expressed in the public press
                                here with more and more openness and resolution, is certainly for a
                                greater expansion on the part of Italy than had formerly been openly
                                promulgated. I believe that it is claimed that they are only asking
                                now what was accorded to Italy by the secret Treaty of London of
                                April 26, 1915, with the exception of Fiume, which they now claim as
                                coming within the principle of auto-decision, because Fiume has
                                declared in favor of Italy as her mother country. <pb n="449"
                                    xml:id="pg_449" facs="0519"/>The press has been quite full of
                                “the revolution” at Fiume by which that City has returned to
                                Italy.</p>
                            <p>The facts relating to this matter are being set forth in a paper

                                will give a careful and full account of the episode and of the
                                situation there at present, tinctured perhaps somewhat by Italian
                                predilection. Succinctly, the facts appear to be that a Committee
                                terming itself the National Committee of Fiume, consisting of some
                                250 Italians by race prepared a proclamation on the 29th of October
                                which was ratified on the 30th at the municipality, which it appears
                                has always been an Italian institution. Five young Irredenti
                                Italians left that night for Trieste by automobile, arriving before
                                Trieste had declared itself for Italy. There they obtained a tug and
                                motor boat and proceeded to Venice where they duly arrived after
                                having been fired on, it being supposed that they were Austrians. At
                                Venice they obtained an audience with the Italian Chief of Staff,
                                Admiral Thaon de Revel, from whom they requested assistance and
                                protection, which was granted and an Italian squadron was
                                immediately sent under Admiral Renier to Fiume, where it was
                                received, according to report, with tremendous enthusiasm. The
                                squadron is still in the port while the town is in the hands of
                                JugoSlavs with a Croatian governor to whom the Hungarian governor
                                turned over such authority as he could when he left. The Italian
                                flag was torn down but was afterwards, on the demand of the Italian
                                Admiral, replaced and saluted by the Jugo-Slavs. The Jugo-Slav flag
                                was in turn torn down by Italians but this also was afterwards
                                replaced with due honors by order of the Italian Admiral. I am
                                informed that both sides are endeavoring to act with moderation and
                                in such a way as not to precipitate a crash. The Italian Committee,
                                appointed there a sort of a delegate plenipotentiary, who was also
                                given authority by the municipality of Fiume to come to Rome
                                representing that city and after visiting General Diaz he came to
                                Rome and has been received by Premier <persName corresp="#p_OVE1"
                                    >Orlando</persName> and the Sindic of Rome, <persName>Don
                                    Prospero Colonna</persName>, at the Campidoglio, where speeches
                                were exchanged declaratory of the resolution of Fiume to become an
                                integral part of Italy and of Italy to accept this crown.</p>

                                that the Italian Chief of Staff, Admiral Thaon de Revel, has

                                ships to Spalato. This telegram is all that I know of that matter. I
                                feel, however, that the situation is in a certain sense critical
                                because in the present state of excitement there is danger of <pb

                                <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Baron Sonnino</persName> will, I hope,
                                talk fully with you about all these matters while he is in Paris,
                                though it is almost too much to hope. In any event, however, you
                                will be able to form from what he says a fairly accurate idea of
                                what Italy hopes to accomplish in the direction of expansion, and
                                possibly even of control of the Adriatic. No one has ever yet quite
                                ventured to speak of making the Adriatic a <hi rend="italic">mare

                                those who are wise and far-sighted would consider such a thing
                                impracticable, if not impossible.</p>

                            <p>This whole question of the other side of the Adriatic, and of the

                            <p>1. The very rigor of the conditions of armistice imposed upon Germany
                                is proof eloquent, in Italian opinion, of the completeness of the
                                victory of the Allies and of the United States. They involve, in
                                substance, the expelling of the Hohenzollerns, “the abandonment of
                                Alsace-Lorraine, the evacuation of invaded territories, the
                                establishment of three military bridgeheads on the Rhine, the
                                nullification of the Brest-Litowski and Bukarest treaties, the
                                cession of the best part of the German fleet, the evacuation of
                                German colonies and the return of the gold stolen; they also compel
                                Germany to beg for bread. …”<note n="28" xml:id="d357fn28">Omission

                                clearly defining the position not only of the United States, as
                                distinguished from that of the Allies, but the policy of the new
                                Germany towards our Country. Such American position is taken to be
                                that of moderator and conciliator and such German policy is
                                interpreted as aimed at making Germany found her hopes of
                                reconstruction more and more upon America. The only doubt among
                                Italians is how sincere is the German policy and possibly, how far
                                she can “play us;” that is, whether <persName corresp="#p_SW1"
                                    >Solf</persName>’s appeal is a request to American magnanimity
                                and humanity or the beginning of a campaign to create differences
                                between the United States and the Allies. For the feeling is growing
                                among Italian observers that while Germany is undoubtedly undergoing
                                a tremendous internal transformation, it is doing so in almost as
                                orderly and meticulous a manner as she prepared for war, or, in
                                other words, that the old “efficiency” is still at work, and that
                                under an apparently revolutionary outward change old mental
                                attitudes still prevail, both as regards keeping the racial unity of
                                the Germans compact, and of securing dominance by creating
                                dissensions among her adversaries.</p>
                            <p>2. With the quieting down of the rejoicing and excitement over
                                victory and peace, Italian thoughtful opinion begins to look forward
                                to the great problems which confront the new and completed Italy.
                                “Victory having assured us freedom” writes the Radical <hi

                                devoting ourselves without obstacles from without to the great task
                                of the internal reforms of our country.…<note n="29"
                                    xml:id="d357fn29">Omission indicated in the original.</note> The
                                war is ended, but a new struggle begins—a longer, harder and harsher
                                struggle. Are we ready to meet the new duties?”</p>
                            <p>The general Italian answer to this seems to be that the first duty of
                                the people is to observe order and to labor mightily, and the first
                                duty of the Government to promptly solve the problems of
                                alimentation and demobilization. Unemployment on a vast scale,
                                following demobilization, is the great danger to be avoided. “There
                                will be no unemployment—there cannot be unemployment,” comments the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Popolo Romano</hi>, “if those principles are

                                been suggested by experts in order to place Italy in the position of
                                being able to meet her own industrial and agricultural needs.” The
                                financial problems can only be met by at once providing for the
                                increase of Italian exports; agriculture must be encouraged to
                                intensify production by supplying it with farm machinery, seeds and
                                    fertilizers.…,<note n="29" xml:id="d357fn30">Omission indicated

                                produced munitions must be employed at once in the labor of manifold

                                    facs="0522"/>which heretofore were imported. The larger
                                industries must find their new activities in home demands, including
                                building trades, agriculture and metallurgical current needs. But
                                all this is possible only if the Gov’ts will at once assure the
                                country of raw materials, coal and cotton. Italy, on her part, has a
                                few “prime materials” indispensable to other countries and these she
                                must use for her exchanges. New tonnage is the supreme demand. “If
                                existing shipyards are insufficient, Italy must improvise new ones
                                as America has done, and thousands of workmen, discharged by the
                                factories can find employment in such dry docks.”</p>
                            <p>3. The Italian press announces that the Italian authorities, pursuant
                                to the terms of the armistice, have taken over the control of
                                Austria’s railroads, of the principal highway junctions and of the
                                passes “towards the German frontier.” The chief of traffic of the
                                Italian State railroads, Comm. Berrini, has taken charge of the
                                reorganization of railroad traffic in the liberated territories.</p>
                            <p>4. The Italian Supreme Military Command, “in view of the
                                politico-military situation” has drawn a new boundary for the War
                                Zone in northern Italy, which took effect at midnight on November
                                10, 1918. The exact boundary along every sector is given by the
                                daily press.</p>

                                Austro-Hungarian yoke, “the city of Fiume with its territory
                                constituting from ancient times and upon statutory bases a ‘corpus

                                itself to its mother country, Italy. It closes by asking the Italian

                                transition.”</p>
                            <p>It is to be noted that under the Pact of London this “corpus

                            <p>1. The Italian press points out that the formula used by

                                his imperial and kingly position is unprecedented in constitutional
                                or revolutionary annals. He proclaims that he “withdraws from the
                                affairs of state” and then leaves for an unknown destination; but he
                                does not use the word abdication or any equivalent.</p>
                            <p>2. The new Military Clauses to the Austro-Hungarian armistice
                                contains nothing of note as modifying substantially the conditions
                                of the original document. But some Italian correspondents from the
                                front claim that Austro-Hungary (through its military
                                representatives) is already raising objection to and trying to give
                                peculiar and restricted interpretation to certain clauses of the
                                armistice, evasions and objections which seem to some Italians to
                                indicate the equivocal diplomacy which the enemy will attempt at the
                                peace conference. Thus it is reported that the Austrian claims that
                                certain of the Italian conquests are illegal because they took place
                                between 3 p.m. of November 3rd and 3 p.m. of November 4th, the date
                                agreed on for the suspension of hostilities, the Austrians now

                                to-wit, at 3 p.m. of the 3rd of November. It is said that this point
                                was raised at the armistice conference by General Ziverkowsky and
                                refused by General Badoglio who insisted on the Italian
                                interpretation of Article I of the armistice. The report is
                                important, if at all, as possibly showing the spirit of the enemy in
                                any future peace discussion and the necessity of guarding against
                                it.</p>
                            <p>3. The matter of the relief to and of organization of the liberated
                                and the conquered Italian provinces is receiving much attention by
                                Italian public men. As regards the conquered or “redeemed”
                                territories it is probable that they will be divided into four
                                provinces with at least four Prefectures: at Trento, Trieste,
                                Bolzano and Gorizia. Practically since the war; began the Italian
                                Government has been actively planning and organizing every branch of
                                Government in and for the territories to be annexed to Italy, the
                                work being largely undertaken by the Segretariato degli Affari
                                Civili of the Italian Supreme Military Command, under the very able
                                direction of Dr. <persName>Agostino d’Adamo</persName>, ex-secretary
                                at the Ministry of the Interior and a man with whom this Embassy has
                                established friendly relations.</p>
                            <p>As to the condition of the Italian provinces which the enemy had
                                invaded, reports agree that the enemy has destroyed or removed
                                everything of any value. Here are some important examples: at <pb
                                    n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0524"/>Portogruaro station all the
                                great depots and the junction railroad system have been blown up;
                                the railroad line from Portogruaro to Cervignano is practically
                                wholly out of commission. Tossalta, Latisana and other railroad
                                stations in the Veneto are destroyed. Most of the bridges across the
                                Tagliamento and the Stella, Turgnino, Corno and Anssa streams are
                                still serviceable. The civilian population has been despoiled of
                                everything by very methodical methods of looting; conditions are
                                especially hard at Portogruaro, San Dona, San Giorgio, Torre and
                                Zuino, where medicines, doctors, bread and even water are sorely
                                needed, reservoirs and wells having been destroyed by the enemy.
                                Supplies, it is said, can be most easily sent by water to the
                                “ports” of Portogruaro and Anssa.</p>
                            <p>Deputy <persName>Giulio Alessio</persName> on his return from a visit
                                to the liberated provinces has published a long account of what he
                                saw there. He says that the conditions in the districts of
                                Conegliano, Oderzo, Vittorio and of the Province of Adene “are very
                                grave.” First the Germans, then the Hungarians and lastly the
                                Austrians successively deprived the population of all they owned
                                from foodstuffs to metal articles, from wood for fuel to the
                                cattle—stocks with which these districts were splendidly supplied.
                                All means of transportation and of traffic have either been removed
                                or are in need of repairs.</p>
                            <p>Deputy <persName>Alessio</persName> considers the urgent needs as
                                follows: the immediate feeding and physical protection of the
                                civilian populations, local relief agencies, Italian and Allied,
                                however worthy being insufficient and unable to reach the most needy
                                who are scattered in not easily accessible farm districts.
                                Transports are most urgently needed. The need for the return of the
                                local civilian officials is also great for the re-establishment of
                                civil order, but a difficulty is found to this in the fact that many
                                such ex-employees are now employed at such higher salaries elsewhere
                                and are not willing to return; the Government must find a way of
                                compelling them.</p>
                            <p>The Government is also urged to greater activity in the ascertainment
                                of the damages caused by the war and the enemy and the establishment
                                of financial credits on a patriotic and now [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >less?</hi>] speculative basis. The financial difficulties are
                                made worse by the enormous quantity of Austrian paper in circulation
                                there and the adjustment of such paper to Italian Currency
                                values.</p>
                            <p>As to the actual physical reconstruction, Deputy
                                    <persName>Alessio</persName> suggests the employment of the
                                Italian engineering troops which have rendered such splendid
                                services in the line of public works during the war.</p>
                            <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">4?</hi>] The Dalmatian question is assuming
                                daily more importance among Italians and feeling is waxing warmer
                                and more intense. It is a complex and delicate problem towards whose
                                solution there seems little disposition on either side to be calm.
                                We can only here present, from day to day, as they come up some of
                                the Italian arguments. It appears <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455"
                                    facs="0525"/>that the Jugo-Slavs are exercising a kind of police
                                power over some of the towns claimed by or aspired to by the
                                Italians. In whose name, asks Italian opinion, do such Jugo-Slavs
                                attempt to exercise such power and by what right? For it must be
                                borne in mind constantly that up to the present time the Jugo-Slavs
                                have not been recognized as a State, but merely as a movement for
                                the organization of a State.</p>
                            <p>Again, the Italians are claiming rights on towns not included in the
                                Pact of London, such as the City of Fiume and Zara. They justify
                                this and their claims to occupy them on the ground that the Pact of
                                London antedates not only the acceptance but even the announcement
                                of the Wilsonian principle of auto-decision which is to-day the
                                basic principle for the establishment of a durable and just peace.
                                That Pact, moreover, was agreed upon when there was no Allied or
                                American policy favoring or contemplating the dismemberment of
                                Austro-Hungary and was based on principles of equilibrium rather
                                than of justice. But now that the Hapsburg Empire is destroyed an
                                entirely new situation arises in which Italy has distinct and worthy
                                claims. Races now count more than political equilibriums and the
                                principles of racial liberty and of auto-decision cannot be invoked,
                                say the Italians, by every racial group except those of Italian
                                origin and Italian aspirations. It is pointed out that in the case
                                of the Italians the “territorial boundaries coincide with the
                                ethnical boundaries” a splendid proof that the “racial nationalism”
                                of the Italians has maintained itself inviolate even when under
                                foreign oppression. Upon this theory not only Fiume is claimed, but
                                Spalato, Arbe and Trani also should “re-enter into the Italian
                                family.”</p>
                            <p>One important fact in the current situation is that everywhere the
                                Italian armies are welcomed in the occupied formerly Austrian
                                territories because of the order they bring and the liberal
                                government they establish. Even in the new Tyrolese Republic at
                                Insbruck the near presence of Italian troops appears welcome. This
                                capacity for prompt and yet not oppressive establishment of order by
                                the Italian military commanders is an element of practical
                                importance which should not be excluded for the purely political
                                aims of other nations; that is, if Italy, at this moment, is the
                                only Power which can bring order and relative freedom of Government
                                in debatable frontier centres, the Allies should not, it seems, stop
                                her simply because of the fear that she might refuse later to
                                evacuate them. The supreme thing at this moment would seem to be the
                                necessity of maintaining order and preventing disorder.</p>
                            <p>Certainly, the Italian Government makes no attempt to conceal its aid
                                to the movement among the Italians in Dalmatia to assert their
                                rights and make known their desire to be united to Italy. The
                                Italian destroyer <hi rend="italic">Andace</hi> has gone to Zara
                                with supplies for the population and disembarked police forces which
                                were received with <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0526"/>great
                                enthusiasm. Yesterday at the Campidoglio in Rome the Mayor, Prince
                                Colonna, with a number of Italian Senators and Deputies officially
                                received Dr. <persName>Gino Antoni</persName>, “Delegate of the City
                                of Fiume to the Italian Government.” Dr. <persName>Antonio
                                    Vio</persName>, Mayor of Fiume, <persName>Andrea
                                    Bellen</persName>, ex-Mayor of Fiume, and a number of municipal
                                officers of that city who expressed the desire of their constituents
                                to be annexed to Italy.</p>
                            <p>As further evidence of activity in this line, the Italian Institute
                                for Colonial and Commercial Expansion and the Commercial Museum of
                                Venice have joined in a call for a national gathering at which to
                                study various Adriatic problems, economic and political.</p>
                            <p>But of special interest would seem the reports coming from the front
                                on the attitude of the Italian troops regarding the general question
                                herein discussed in outline. What the soldiers think is a very
                                important item in the present situation and it is an item upon which
                                there has been little reliable information. “The Italian Army”
                                justly observes an Italian daily, “is not a military machine but a
                                conscious organism which reacts to current situations with great
                                promptness.” Recent newspaper correspondence from the front, whose
                                reliability we cannot gauge, say that the soldiers feel keenly the
                                problem of Italy’s boundaries and that among the thinking elements
                                such interest is based on the consciousness that Italy, by her
                                victories, has risen to a position of guardian and of leader among
                                the small States arising out of the defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire
                                and also of a really Great Power in the responsible duty of helping
                                to assure the peace of Europe. As such she needs in a very real
                                sense to have absolutely safe strategic boundaries, for at the north
                                she will have the pressure of a probably greater Germany and to the
                                east the danger of a number of Slav States in the unstable process
                                of formation.</p>
                            <p>Lastly the soldiers are the best reporters of the real feeling of the
                                “liberated populations;” they are the first to enter the new
                                territories, they see the actual situation before political and
                                diplomatic machinations and intrigues, local and external, are set
                                in motion, and can really feel the pulse of the people. For this
                                reason it would seem most advisable to get all information possible
                                as to their point of view.</p>

                            <p>1. Deputy Perolini, who is a sort of Republican whip in the Italian
                                Chamber, made a speech the other day in which he stated that the <pb
                                    n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0527"/>old “truce” between the
                                Republicans and the Monarchy was at an end now that Italy’s
                                unification had been completed. The “truce” dates back to the
                                decision by the greatest practical political leader of Italian
                                Republicanism—Francesco Crispi, who though a Mazzinian, labored in
                                the building up of monarchical Italy on the well-known theory that
                                “the Republic would divide us while the Monarchy unites us.” The
                                practical importance of Perolini’s declaration is very limited
                                except as a “sign of the times.” The Italian Republican Party is a
                                mere ghost of a political organization, and the danger of any
                                political upheaval in Italy, if it exists, is not to be sought among
                                the Republicans. On the other hand, the popular demonstration
                                yesterday when <persName corresp="#p_VE1">Victor Emmanuel
                                    III</persName> arrived in Rome seems an eloquent proof of how
                                strong and spontaneous is the popular affection for the King. The
                                demonstration, wholly unofficial, showed the temper of the people,
                                at least in Rome. As one paper puts it: “To-day the King represented
                                to all the Head of the State, the personification of the <hi

                                    >Omission indicated in the original.</note> Although the
                                Constitution grants to the Crown the prerogative of declaring war,
                                our King did not take it upon himself to decide upon this war; he
                                merged his aspirations with those of the people, and at the right
                                moment he expressed the will of the people.”</p>
                            <p>2. It is officially announced that the Italian Parliament will open
                                on November 20th, the Cabinet being expected to be present in full
                                except possibly the Foreign Minister who is in Paris and may be
                                detained there at the Versailles Conference on the Allied peace
                                proposals. The official announcement of the opening simply states
                                that the Government will make some communications to the two Houses.
                                The session is expected to be a brief one and to be devoted largely
                                to a patriotic expression of national approval and resolve to profit
                                by the great opportunities opened to the nation. So far only one
                                Deputy has entered his name to discuss the Government’s
                                communication, the regular Socialist, Turati. The budget will have
                                to be approved and a number of legislative measures regarding the
                                organization of the redeemed provinces in relation to the national
                                organization will be submitted by the Cabinet for discussion and
                                approval. A certain activity of political groups is evidently aimed
                                at “bucking up” the government against any weakness or compromise in
                                case the extreme or revolutionary elements should attempt to make
                                trouble. The <hi rend="italic">Fascio</hi> in the Senate and the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Intesa Democratica</hi> in the Chamber have passed
                                resolutions to such effect. Interest centres as to what will be done
                                to establish the parliamentary representative for the redeemed
                                provinces. The <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0528"/>most recent
                                precedent is that of 1866 when, after the armistice of Cormons, the
                                Veneto was annexed to Italy. In that case after the treaty of peace
                                was signed with Austria under which such new provinces became an
                                integral part of the Kingdom of Italy, a plebiscite was decreed. The
                                result of the plebiscite was an overwhelming decision in favor of
                                annexation to Italy. The Italian Parliament then adjourned and
                                parliamentary elections were ordered to take place in such new
                                provinces, while the Crown appointed a number of most prominent
                                citizens of those territories as members of the Italian Senate. The
                                elections were held and on December 15th the King <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VE1">Victor Emmanuel II</persName>, opened a new
                                session of the Italian Parliament (IX Legislative Session) at which
                                the deputies and senators from the new provinces participated.</p>
                            <p>The extreme parties are also active, though there seems to be little
                                question that the report of the Socialist and labor riots at Milan,
                                are greatly exaggerated. Yesterday representatives of the Regular
                                Socialists of the Communist and Anarchical elements, and of labor
                                organizations met in Rome and after protesting against “the
                                systematic persecution of the Confederated Chamber of Labor from
                                which soldier-members are forcibly excluded from entering to discuss
                                their economic interests” passed resolutions asking the Government
                                to stop such “persecutions,” demanded a general amnesty for all
                                political crimes, the abolition of the censorship and the
                                re-establishment of the right of assembly. It was further decided to
                                call a general meeting of labor organizations to protect and
                                organize against the activities of reactionary forces.</p>
                            <p>The Executive Committee of the Press Correspondents’ Association of
                                Rome also passed resolutions against the “arbitrary decisions of the
                                Italian censorship” and asking for its suppression.</p>
                            <p>The Italian Republican Party has called a national party gathering at
                                Florence for December 8th and 9th.</p>
                            <p>3. The real and most serious question before the Italian Parliament
                                is and will be the urgent matter of solving the complicated and
                                delicate problems connected with demobilization and the adjustment
                                of the nations to the new peace situation. There are the clearest
                                signs that the Government is not only having difficulties in this
                                trying line, but has not been sufficiently foresighted and
                                forearmed. The difficulty is complicated by the efforts of the old
                                bureaucracy and of the “organisms” created by the war to keep
                                control of the situation by trying to undertake the handling of
                                these problems without any adequate preparation or technical
                                ability. This struggle to hold on to office to the great detriment
                                of the nation is well summarized by Deputy Cabrini in an article in
                                the Rome <hi rend="italic">Epoca</hi>. “Not only the organisms
                                created for the war are making desperate efforts to survive the

                            <p>4. A correspondent to the Italian press from the Italian Army
                                Headquarters gives the following summarized information regarding
                                the situation at Fiume: When, on October 28th, the constitution of
                                the new Jugo-Slav State, including Fiume, was proclaimed at
                                Zagabria, the Italians of Fiume immediately protested, declared
                                their intention to annex their City to Italy and appealed for
                                Italian intervention to prevent disorder. The Italian Admiral Rainer
                                went into Fiume harbor on the cruiser <persName>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Emanuele Filiberto</hi>
                                </persName> and established relations with the municipal
                                authorities. On November 4th he landed, welcomed by the Italians,
                                but being received frigidly by the Jugo-Slavs Committee at the City
                                Hall he ordered the Italian flag raised, and, shortly thereafter
                                said flag having been torn down, he gave the opponents just one hour
                                to replace it honorably in default of which he announced that he
                                would “resort to energetic measures.” The flag was replaced. This
                                incident is ascribed to the activities of an intransigent element
                                among the Croats and is alleged to have been the only outward sign
                                of turbulence in Fiume.</p>
                            <p>On or about November 11th, two French torpedo boats approached the
                                Adamich pier in the Fiume harbor; the Croats invited the Commander
                                of one of these French boats to pay his respects to their so called
                                “government” but the French captains instead visited Admiral Rainer
                                aboard his flag ship and a few hours after such French boats left
                                the harbor. Another Italian cruiser, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Terruccio</hi>, has since arrived at Fiume and received an
                                enthusiastic welcome. The correspondent concludes by saying, “Aside
                                from the incident above described, there does not exist a real and
                                fundamental dissension; and no one has any interest to create
                                one.”</p>
                            <p>5. The press discusses some of the questions which are supposed to be
                                engaging <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> and the
                                other Allied representatives at Versailles to-day. “To fix the
                                preliminaries of peace,” writes the Milan <hi rend="italic"

                                <hi rend="italic">Sera</hi>, “means to fix the major lines of the
                                future economic, political and territorial situation of to-morrow’s

                                complicated and delicate problems upon which hangs the future
                                international situation and in this respect their decisions are more
                                important than those which await the Peace Conference itself which
                                will, largely, accept what the Conferees at Versailles agree
                                upon.</p>
                            <p>A fundamental preliminary question to be decided is “who will be
                                admitted to the Peace Conference and who will be excluded?” To
                                understand the difficulty of even the preliminary question, it is
                                enough to consider the present condition of two of the belligerents
                                of 1914—Russia and Austro-Hungary. The component parts of the latter
                                will have to be represented; and yet the old Austro-Hungary is still
                                a “diplomatic fiction” which may create difficulties in the very
                                task of liquidating it. As regards Russia, her people are certainly
                                entitled to participate in the Peace Conference, as are also the
                                German people now that the Hohenzollerns have been sent away, but

                            to be the leading article in all newspapers. To-day, press announced

                            says: President should come to [apparent omission] so as to realize
                            Italians are not militaristic and to understand tolerant and universal
                            spirit among Italians, which he claims [is] due to Catholic education,

                            confidence in Government’s choice of men. Strong movement in certain

                            insufficiency proposals relative to the reform measures. <persName

                            discussing largely Socialist part at coming Peace Conference. Among

                            Dodecanese Islands, meanwhile Italian program in Adriatic is developing.
                            Italian troops occupied Sebenico, November 6th, Zara, November 7th.
                            Naval contingents in Dalmatia have been strengthened by reinforcements

                            Allied troops. Official reports state bulk of Austro-Hungarian fleet
                            disarmed. Mine fields along enemy coast being cleared and
                            Austro-Hungarian merchant marine being put in navigable condition.

                            being rapidly reestablished. Situation along this coast somewhat less
                            critical, but still far from settled. Italians claim French influence
                            against Italian interests.</p>
                        <p>Signor Segre, formerly Commissioner of Refugees in Italy and citizen of

                            has been carried on systematically by enemy during the last weeks; that
                            such immigrants arriving at the rate of 1,000 per diem; that only way to
                            prevent this plan of enemy to Austrianize and Germanize Trieste and
                            other Italian cities on Adriatic is for Italian Government absolutely to
                            close present military frontier for definite period so that Government
                            may make inventory of all movable and personal property which is now
                            being removed or claimed by unlawful owners.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Calvilleni at popular gathering November 30th at Fiume is
                            reported to have said in speech that diplomatic discussions were under
                            way regarding rights [of] Fiume, but that such discussions were merely
                            debates of diplomats and political men; that Fiume was Italian and would
                            remain so; that no intermeddling could in any way damage Italian rights.
                            A massed meeting at Rome November 30th in theater where many Government
                            representatives were present, urged immediate annexation of Fiume to
                            Italy. Sarajevo. Jugo-Slav ministry still appears uncertain, though last
                            reports make it wholly composed of Servian ministers. Much uncertainty
                            exists regarding relations between Hungarian Government and Croat
                            National Council. General Boroevic, formerly in supreme command of
                            Austro-Hungarian armies on Italian front, still appears to be
                            commander-in-chief of Jugo-Slav army. King <persName corresp="#p_NI1"

                            full report on general situation to Paris.<note n="38" xml:id="d360fn38"
                                >Daily telegraphic reports not printed.</note> Political situation.
                            Following is only a brief summary. At Rome elaborate preparations are
                            being made for reception of the President. Articles are being printed in
                            the papers regarding his visit here, although instructions regarding his
                            visit have not yet been received here. Press announces that President
                            will make a formal visit to <persName>Pope</persName>. Embassy has
                            confined itself to state that while it hopes President <pb n="464"
                                xml:id="pg_464" facs="0534"/>can find it possible to come to Italy,
                            no definite plans have been made yet.</p>
                        <p>A great deal of discussion continues regarding Italy’s relations with
                            Jugo-Slavs. Opinion crystallizing on absolute necessity of firm policy.
                            An article published with a map with opinion of Italian Military Staff
                            showing boundaries which as stated are just sufficient for the security
                            of Italy, and at the same time allowing Jugo-Slavia a coast line between
                            Dalmatia and Istria. The press has given much space to finance and
                            economic questions.</p>
                        <p>Polish Committee at Rome announces Polish Army composed of
                            Austro-Hungarian prisoners made by Italy rapidly progressing. In all the
                            total is about 30,000 men. One regiment of 4,000 men ready to leave at
                            once for Poland.</p>
                        <p>There is still much discussion as to the question of continuing Italian
                            propaganda. Gallanga, in charge of the same, who is alleged to have
                            opposed it last summer on Jugo-Slav aspirations, has resigned to
                            majority of opinions in favor of continuing, as it is believed that
                            Italy is in need of being properly understood by the outside world. The
                            consul reports from Southern Italy state political conditions generally
                            quiet. In Naples smallpox causing anxiety. The reports from Northern
                            Italy state conditions though entirely against recent Government,
                            monopolies still continue. Convention Republican Party in Florence
                            apparently made effect, and everywhere is expressed great enthusiasm on
                            the approaching visit of the President, except in extreme Socialist

                        <p>29. I hear from Italian source which should be reasonably well informed
                            that some sort of “treaty” touching peace provisions has been arrived at
                            between England and France and Italy. Will endeavor to verify.</p>

                        <p>31. My 29 [of] which Paris informed. I learn that same report I sent has
                            been sent by my colleagues. It is thought that the treaty or
                            understanding between England, France and Italy contains an agreement to
                            stand by each other in the essential results of the war including
                            territorial claims such as the French and Italian claims. Paris
                            informed.</p>

                            the Italian version, as does also that of Article 15, which deals with
                            the exclusion of the Vatican from peace negotiations. There seems to be
                            some mystery as to what these differences are. I am told that they are
                            unimportant, but I cannot at present find out in what they consist.</p>

                            <p>The <persName>Saint Jean de Maurienne</persName> conference was held

                                    de Maurienne</persName>. There were present <persName

                                    <persName>Ribot</persName>, <persName>Boselli</persName>, and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>, who were later
                                joined by Barrère, French Ambassador at Rome, Raggi, Italian
                                Ambassador at Paris, Major General <persName>Sir G. M. W.
                                    MacDonough</persName>, Lieut-Col. <persName>Sir Maurice
                                    Hankey</persName>, <persName>Signor di Martino</persName> and
                                Count <persName>Aldrovandi</persName>.</p>
                            <p>The first subject discussed was that of Italian aspirations in Asia
                                Minor.</p>
                            <p>In order to understand clearly the purpose of this conference it
                                should be remembered that the so-called London Agreement of April
                                26th, 1915, between Italy, France, Great Britain and Russia,
                                promised to Italy an equitable share in the division of Turkey in
                                Asia. Italy was to receive territory in the neighborhood of Adalia,
                                where she had already acquired rights and interests under an
                                Anglo-Italian treaty. At the same time the Russian claims to
                                Constantinople had already been under discussion between France and
                                Great Britain and the conversations between the two governments had
                                resulted in the Sykes-Picot agreement of May 9th, 1916.<note n="46"

                            <p>There had also been recent discussions between <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName> and the French and Italian
                                ambassadors with a view to delimiting the Italian sphere in Asia
                                Minor. These, however, had failed owing to the irreconcilable nature
                                of the French and Italian claims. Italy demanded inclusion within
                                her sphere of Mersina and Adana, but the French refused to renounce
                                their claims to either place. The British Foreign Office was not
                                disposed to include Smyrna in the Italian sphere and proposed,
                                instead, an arrangement giving Italy a sphere starting at the Gulf
                                of Scala Nova on the west, including Konia, and thence running east
                                and striking the French sphere near Ulukishla and thence coming down
                                to the Mediterranean coast near Anamur. The Italians, however,
                                refused to accept this scheme.</p>

                                    George</persName>, I have reason to believe, submitted a new

                                sphere including Smyrna and a second hinterland sphere bounded by a
                                line running from a point south of Adramyti, on the Gulf of the same
                                name, north to Balikesri and thence to Kutaya, thence south,
                                excluding the Bagdad Railway, to Eregli, excluding Konia, and thence
                                south to the coast to a point just west of Mersina. This arrangement
                                would give the Turkish state which was to have been allowed to exist
                                in a portion of Asia Minor, free access to the sea through the port
                                of Selefkeh and would have enabled the Italians to construct branch
                                lines from the Bagdad Railway to the coast.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName>Ribot</persName> had no objections to such an arrangement.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>, at first, seemed
                                satisfied with it, but after consulting experts made difficulties
                                and increased his demand. He claimed that if only one or two Allies
                                could realize their aspirations in Asia Minor at the end of the war
                                Italy should be given compensation elsewhere. His idea seems to have
                                been that although Great Britain, France and Russia might be able to
                                realize their aspirations in Mesopotamia, Syria and Armenia, Italy
                                was not likely to be so fortunate in Asia Minor.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> put forward the
                                following motion in French, the text of which I have seen and been
                                able hastily to translate: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It is understood that if an agreement should be reached at
                                        the Peace Conference such that the three powers are unable
                                        to share equally in the total or partial possession of the
                                        territories considered in the above convention, an
                                        understanding shall be reached establishing the compensation
                                        due to the power which may be obliged to content itself with
                                        a sphere of influence only, to make up for the difference
                                        between such a simple sphere of influence (to be recognized
                                        by Turkey and the Allies or by the Allies alone) and actual
                                        territorial possessions.”</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName>, however,
                                objected to this. He pointed out that Italy was doing nothing to
                                help in the war against Turkey, whereas <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469"
                                    facs="0539"/>Great Britain had in Turkey 300,000 troops,
                                exclusive of Salonika operations. He felt that if Italy had
                                ambitions in Asia Minor she ought to contribute to their
                                realization. He offered to concentrate a greater portion of the
                                British forces in Palestine against Turkey and help Italy realize
                                her aspirations, provided that Italy would send infantry to Salonika
                                to replace the British infantry on the Macedonian front. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>, however, refused and
                                declined even to submit the proposition to his government or to
                                Cadorna. <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName>, I am
                                told, then hinted that <persName corresp="#p_SBS1"
                                    >Sonnino</persName> was trying to obtain, by blackmail
                                elsewhere, what Italy was not making any effort to earn in Turkey.
                                He refused to consider the question of compensation elsewhere, for
                                Italy, but agreed that at the end of the war Italian claims would be
                                discussed. He then put forward a resolution, the English text of
                                which is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It is understood that if at any time when peace is declared
                                        the total or partial possession of the territory

                                        of these powers then the interests of the powers concerned
                                        will again be taken into equitable consideration.”</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>This resolution, after much discussion and amendments, which have
                                been included in the text, was accepted.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>, however, raised
                                another difficulty. He pointed out that the plan proposed by the
                                British General Staff did not include Konia, which, however, had
                                been included in <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1">Balfour</persName>’s
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName> replied, that
                                the General Staff scheme was an entirely new plan and was much more
                                generous to Italy, as it included Smyrna and the territory west of
                                Mersina in the sphere accorded Italy. Konia was excluded in order to
                                give it to Turkey as the new capital. <persName corresp="#p_SBS1"
                                    >Sonnino</persName>, however, insisted and finally <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LGD1">Lloyd George</persName> agreed to consult the
                                British Cabinet, and to have further negotiations with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> regarding the matter. He
                                also promised to send <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>
                                a map embodying the British General Staff’s plan.<note n="47"

                            />agreement, or understanding has been made between Italy and other
                            Allies such as referred to in above mentioned telegrams. He further
                            stated that no agreement or understanding was arrived at between the
                            Jugo-Slavs and the Italians such as I mentioned to the President as
                            having been made about the time of Congress of Rome. He added that
                            possibly individuals may have discussed and tried to arrive at some such
                            understanding, but nothing resulted and the Italian Government knows of
                            no such understanding.</p>
                        <p>The Servian Minister here also declares that no such understanding as

                            though this not considered imminent danger. Feeling between military of
                            the several countries is always liable to show itself and at several
                            points in Italy there have been times when they were very near to
                            conflict. This includes always a danger.</p>

                                >Sonnino</persName>’s program and consequent resignation still
                            unsolved and uncertain. Reasons for resignation appear to be difference
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> over Adriatic and
                            disapproval over <persName corresp="#p_OVE1">Orlando</persName>’s
                            alleged half heartedness in real application Wilsonian principles to
                            Italian national and international problems. As portion of press backing
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> and <persName

                            following in the country is not believed very large. At present the
                            propaganda for Italian expansion along eastern Adriatic shore is
                            tremendous, but [<hi rend="italic">and?</hi>] influential. Milan’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Corriere Delia Sera</hi> is favoring him. <persName

                            endeavor conciliation, but this not likely without substantial
                            concessions to <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bissolati</persName>’s views.
                            Meanwhile executive committee Italian Reform Socialist Party passes
                            resolution forbidding in effect any Reform Socialist from joining
                            Cabinet as <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bissolati</persName>’s

                            Genoa. It looks as though all this is with at least consent of
                            Government which finds itself apparently distrusted by British election
                            and the favor with which the foreign propaganda is received here.</p>

                            so that safe conducts are necessary before vessels can enter them.

                            American shippers can consign to Trent under same regulations apply to

                        <p>57. Urgent for the President. <persName corresp="#p_BL1"
                                >Bissolati</persName>’s having seen the President, has made a
                            profound impression here. I had a conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBS1">Baron Sonnino</persName> late this afternoon which
                            indicates, as possible, important changes his position. Both he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OVE1">Orlando</persName>, whom I had seen
                            earlier in the day, were manifestly much impressed and even anxious over
                            this situation. <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName>
                            reiterated his arguments as to the means of redeeming Italy from peril
                            of menace from inner water way of Eastern Coast, and to my suggestion
                            that provision might be made to prevent possibility of this menace and
                            secure freedom of really Italian cities under guarantees, he argued the
                            impossibility of such a provision being effective and cited the present
                            condition of terror in Montenegro, whose independence is being destroyed
                            under a presumingly free choice by her people, and added that the
                                <persName>King</persName> had told the President something of the
                            situation. On this I having first made plain that I had no part in the
                            peace proceedings and no authority to speak for the President, or
                            anyone. I asked <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> why he
                            did not give up his contention about Dalmatia, which does not appeal to
                            others and try to secure the freedom of the really Italian cities and
                            the independence of Montenegro. I said “You are the one <pb n="474"
                                xml:id="pg_474" facs="0544"/>who can bring Italy and America
                            together, and settle one of the most difficult obstacles to the peace.”
                            He appeared struck by this, and said that if Montenegro which has always
                            been free and withstood the Turks so long were given independence, and
                            were given Cattaro, which is necessary to her, it would certainly make a
                            difference to Italy. I told him I did not know the President’s views on
                            the present Montenegrin situation beyond the general sympathy with the
                            aspirations of peoples to be free, but personally had much sympathy with
                            Montenegro and believed the recent so-called election in Montenegro to
                            have been a sham.</p>
                        <p>I think <persName corresp="#p_SBS1">Sonnino</persName> is ready in view
                            of recent manifestations to concede much more than ever before.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Here is a copy of the
                            paper about which I spoke to the Commission yesterday afternoon. It was
                            handed to me by General <persName>di Robilant</persName>, the Italian
                            Military Representative with the Supreme War Council. He gave it to me
                            with the evident intent that I would transmit it to the War Department
                            in Washington and give it other circulation among Americans. He tells me
                            that it represents the official views of the Italian Government on the
                            problem of the Adriatic. He says that his Government has received a
                            report from its military attaché in Washington in which the latter says
                            that he found a sentiment in the American State Department and Navy
                            Department rather inclined to be favorable to the Italian views; but
                            that he found the contrary to be the case in the War Department.</p>
                        <p>If this document represents the official Italian view, you will note that
                            the claims of that government are based solely on an assumed revival of
                            war in the not distant future. You will also note the statement that
                            Italy entered the war practically for the sole purpose of making the
                            annexations now claimed. I do not suppose that the American Government,
                            in making large loans of money, in the contribution of large quantities
                            of supplies, and in furnishing the slight direct military assistance
                            which it did to Italy, had for a moment in mind the fact that it was
                            doing all this solely for the purpose of enabling Italy to make these
                            conquests.</p>

                            <p>The many arguments which have been put forward in favor of New
                                Italy’s right to extend its sovereignty over some strips of the
                                eastern coast of the Adriatic are, by now, generally known. These
                                arguments were an inducement for Italy to enter into the huge fight,
                                which has raged over Europe for four years, and if, at the time they
                                were the very objects of the war, their fulfillment ought to be
                                today the reward for the tremendous sufferings which the country has
                                undergone.</p>
                            <p>These arguments may be roughly divided in two classes: some of them
                                appeal to sentiment, others are based upon facts. This distinction
                                makes it clear that whilst some of our claims (those based on
                                sentiment) although quite legitimate and fair could not, by
                                themselves be strong enough as a deciding argument at the peace
                                conference; others (those based on facts) represent such
                                indispensable needs that failure to get these recognized would
                                deprive Italy of the fruits of her great victory, would cripple her
                                prospects, and definitely prejudice the possibility of a quiet and
                                prosperous future, such as the new destinies indicated by this war
                                offer to our race. This is why Italy cannot but insist on them.</p>

                                        then at war with the Carthaginians, understand how necessary
                                        it was to them to rule the Adriatic, and that in order to do
                                        so they needed to dominate its Eastern Coast. It was thus
                                        that after the end of the first Punic War they started in
                                        229 B. C. the first of these ten Illyrian wars which in the
                                        year 78 B. C. brought the entire region East of the Adriatic
                                        under their rule.</p>
                                    <p>“The whole of Dalmatia belonged to Rome for nearly six
                                        centuries without interruption: it went then to the Italian
                                        Kingdom of Odoacre and to the Italian Kingdom of the
                                        Ostrogoths: and finally to the Empire of the East when Italy
                                        was reconquered. Venice had possession of the whole of it
                                        from the end of the XV century to the end of the XVIII

                                        those short periods during which Dalmatia was partially

                                        rule of the Austrian Monarchy and only in as much as it was
                                        made an heir to the territory of the Venetian Republic.
                                        Dalmatia remained therefore even then all one with Italy. It
                                        was included in Napoleon’s ephemeral Kingdom of Italy, from
                                        which it was only temporarily severed to form the provinces
                                        of Illyria. It then was restored unto Austria together with
                                        Venice and it is only from 1866 until today that it has
                                        existed politically severed from the Italian peninsula.</p>
                                    <p>“Therefore not only by nature art and civilisation, but also
                                        through its history, Dalmatia essentially pertains to
                                        Italy.”</p>

                            <p>Venetian Domination ended by the inclusion of these provinces in the
                                “Serenissima” (i. e. Venetian Republic) of which they became the
                                most solid bulwark containing the most loyal population. Language,
                                religion, dress, buildings, all have testified during past centuries
                                as they do today, to the fact that Dalmatia has become, as she is at
                                present, absolutely Italian. Latin civilization spread itself from
                                that country as far as Croatian, Hungarian and Turkish barbarism
                                permitted; but none of these has ever been able to establish
                                themselves on the Adriatic, which remained notwithstanding an
                                Italian lake.</p>
                            <p>Then came on the scene Austria after the Treaty of Campoformio
                                (1797). The moving episodes of this period, the profound grief of
                                the population of Dalmatia, when the sacred Winged Lion of St.

                                    xml:id="pg_477" facs="0547"/>are related in history. But if the
                                lion disappeared from the flags it remained imprinted in the
                                monuments and hearts of the people!</p>
                            <p>Dalmatia remained fundamentally and faithfully Italian.</p>
                            <p>To overcome this resistance but one course was open to Austria; this
                                was to denationalize Dalmatia. The long odyssey of the Italians
                                persecuted by officials in their homes, in their churches by a new
                                semi-barbaric race, which urged on and favourised by Austria
                                violently infiltrated itself and pushed aside the Italian elements,
                                has been consecrated in literature.</p>
                            <p>And it should be emphasized that in Dalmatia, since the time of the
                                Venetian Republic the Italians have retained control of the public
                                offices, municipalities, learned professions, commerce and industry,
                                in one word, they have been the dominating element in the
                                intellectual life and commerce of the community, while manual and
                                agricultural labour has always been left to a great extent to the
                                Croatian and Slav elements, in a broad spirit of conciliation,
                                civilization and colonization.</p>
                            <p>Under the astute Austrian policy artificial Slavo-Croat immigration,
                                which was started towards 1848 and reached its maximum after 1860,
                                was encouraged by every means available, while an underhand contest
                                was conducted aiming at the exclusion of the Italians from public
                                positions and from the moral and intellectual status which they had
                                held during centuries past.</p>
                            <p>Such a policy necessarily resulted in an increase of the number of
                                the Slavs and a diminution in that of the Italians. Austrian
                                statistics are falsified and ingeniously exaggerated to the
                                detriment of Italian interest. According to what they quote in 1865
                                there were 384,000 Serbo-Croats as against 55,000 Italians, while
                                according to the last Austro-Hungarian official statistics the total
                                Dalmatian population would be of about 627,000 inhabitants of whom
                                only about 20,000 Italians.</p>
                            <p>In the Dalmatian “capitanati” included within the armistice line the
                                total population is of 294,900 inhabitants, which includes 280,900
                                Slavs or Slav-speaking folk, viz. the Morlacchi<note n="*"

                                inhabitants. The official figures ought to be accordingly rectified
                                as follows:</p>
                            <p>In the Dalmatian “capitanati” included within the armistice line
                                there would be about 93,000 Morlacchi and 56,000 Italians against
                                145,000 Slavs; in the “capitanati” not included within the above
                                mentioned line there would be about 100,000 Morlacchi and 29,000
                                Italians against 204,000 Slavs properly speaking.</p>
                            <p>Besides, even if we admit the diminution of the Italian elements in
                                the population shown by the Austro-Hungarian statistics, we should
                                still ask ourselves this question: Does immigration, when, in a
                                given region, it results in a majority over the pre-existing
                                population necessarily confer the rights of sovereignty on the
                                new-comers? The answer is, yes, perhaps when the case involves
                                countries sparsely inhabitated by barbaric races, or belonging to a
                                civilisation definitely inferior, that is, when immigration presents
                                the characteristics of a real and effective colonization, but
                                certainly not if the case is one of a race of a civilization
                                inferior to that of the population of the territory in question,
                                even if the latter is in the minority; certainly not if the said
                                minority keeps all its own national characteristics and finds itself
                                strong enough to infuse these in the majority, by process of
                                assimilation; when it keeps and spreads its own language and control
                                of its industry, its commerce, retains its civil powers and carries
                                on nearly exclusively learned professions.</p>
                            <p>Far less should such an immigration confer rights, when it is the
                                result not of a natural and necessary expansion but is the outcome
                                of political phenomena and of the policy of an unnatural
                                government.</p>
                            <p>The nature of the very recent proceedings, which are causing the
                                Italians to renounce their nationality may be gathered from the
                                reports received of the action taken against our compatriots at
                                Spalato, at Sebenico and at other places by the newly appointed

                                or human will.</p>
                            <p>On the eastern coast there is a wonderful advanced barrier of reefs
                                and islands which, like an impassable screen, protect the mainland
                                and the lines of communication along the coast. On the western coast
                                there is a low beach undefended and exposed to aggression and
                                invasion of every kind. On the east navigation in still waters is
                                possible no matter from what quarter the wind blows; on the west
                                there is no shelter and sailing becomes difficult and risky as soon
                                as ever the sea gets rough. On the east, harbours, wide recesses and
                                good anchorage are to be found anywhere; on the west, landing is
                                generally impossible and it is difficult for ships to find a haven
                                or a shelter.</p>
                            <p>On the east, the coast rises in cliffs each of which is a splendid
                                observation post dominating a wide surface; on the west, the land
                                (with the exception of Gargano and Conero) lies absolutely flat and
                                low and any far-reaching observation on the sea is impossible except
                                through aviation, which, however, can only be active under
                                favourable weather conditions.</p>
                            <p>On the east, the sea is clear and deep and mines can be used with
                                difficulty; on the west, the waters are muddy and shallow and seem
                                made on purpose to favour the terribly insidious work of submarine
                                weapons.</p>
                            <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0550"/>
                            <p>On the east, there is every favourable condition for torpedo boats
                                and submarines to lie in ambush, while on the west, the coast is so
                                flat and straight as to exclude even the possibility of any
                                stealth.</p>
                            <p>Even marine currents are favourable to the Dalmatian coast, since
                                they move from south to north along the eastern coast of the
                                Adriatic; on reaching the Ancona parallel they turn from east to
                                west and wind again southwards along our coast. Consequently, any
                                mine which is torn from its anchorage or thrown into the current on
                                the eastern coast is automatically brought to us to cause death and
                                destruction.</p>
                            <p>At daybreak when the light dawns on a fleet which may have crossed
                                the Adriatic in the dark with a view to attacking the opposite
                                coast, any ships coming from the west would be blinded by the rising
                                sun and find the high eastern coast still entirely clad in darkness,
                                whilst a fleet coming from the east would have the sun at its back
                                and thus be in an ideal position as far as the light is concerned,
                                while the Italian coast would lie helpless before her under the
                                rising sun.</p>
                            <p>An eastern fleet, always screened by islands, unseen and protected
                                from any attack, can transfer her ships from north to south or vice
                                versa from Pola to Cattaro, i. e. along the greater part of the
                                Adriatic coast, sheltered from mines and submarines, whilst the
                                Italian fleet, on leaving Brindisi, is immediately sighted and can
                                be chased, completely unsheltered, up to Venice.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">
                                <hi rend="italic">Military Strategical Arguments.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>1) Italy possesses only two naval harbours in the Adriatic, i. e.
                                Brindisi in the south and Venice in the north; they are 750
                                kilometres apart, and neither of them could hold a large fleet. The
                                geographical structure of the coast between those two points
                                prevents the building of a large central naval harbour.</p>
                            <p>It is consequently impossible for the Italian fleet in the Adriatic
                                to keep together in one anchorage according to sound strategical
                                principles (as for instance in the case of the British Fleet at
                                Scapa Flow, or the French Fleet at Corfu) but her fleet must be
                                divided between Brindisi and Venice, with some ships even at the
                                outside port of Taranto which is not in the Adriatic at all.</p>
                            <p>This is not entirely due to lack of space at the naval bases in the
                                Adriatic above referred to, but also to the fact that if the whole
                                of the fleet were gathered at Brindisi, it could not, on account of
                                the distance, reach the northern Adriatic in time to prevent an
                                enemy attack against the coast, and likewise, if it were gathered in
                                Venice, it would be impossible to reach the southern coast in time.
                                In both cases a fleet belonging to the nation possessing the eastern
                                coast of the Adriatic could always have a free choice both of time
                                and place for an attack; this could be carried out and the fleet
                                could then <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0551"/>retire in good
                                time behind the splendid barrier of Dalmatian reefs and isles before
                                the Italian fleet could reach the spot and deliver battle.</p>
                            <p>2) The Italian Fleet being necessarily split up between Brindisi and
                                Venice, the enemy in possession of the central part of the Dalmatian
                                shore from Zara to Spalato, including Sebenico’s splendid naval
                                harbour, could at any time come out into the open sea to deliver
                                battle. The Italian Fleet coming partly from Venice and partly from
                                Brindisi would then necessarily be compelled to meet with only one
                                part of its forces the whole of the enemy’s ships, and would be
                                obliged to accept battle before being able tactically to join the
                                rest of its forces.</p>
                            <p>Hence ensues the absolute naval submission of the western coast fleet
                                to the fleet from the east coast. Such submission could be expressed
                                as follows: “it would be impossible to attack the eastern fleet on
                                the open sea under equal conditions” or else: “it would be
                                impossible to avoid the strategical and tactical superiority of the
                                enemy even if, on the whole, he were numerically inferior”.</p>
                            <p>3) Even if, at the expense of many milliards, Italy should decide to
                                make Venice and Brindisi into naval bases, each roomy enough to
                                harbour a large fleet, and if after having done so, she should
                                decide to develop her Adriatic Fleet and make it double the enemy’s
                                fleet in the same sea, even then, she would have no possibility of
                                forcing the enemy to battle on equal conditions. In fact, whilst the
                                enemy’s fleet, on reaching the Italian coast is at any time in a
                                condition to bombard thickly-peopled cities, to break up railways
                                and roads, telegraphic, telephonic and optical connections, to
                                prevent movement of troops towards the north during mobilisation,
                                possibly to land small bodies of troops, and having done so, to
                                retire to its base; on the contrary, the Italian fleet, on reaching
                                the eastern coast would meet a barrier of reefs, isles and mined
                                channels which form an inviolable line of defence of the enemy’s
                                mainland, and which screen and protect any shifting of the enemy’s
                                fleet northwards or southwards, thus enabling him either to avoid
                                the battle or to issue from the North or South from behind the
                                defensive barrier, attacking the Italian fleet from the back on the
                                open sea, cutting it off from its base and keeping up the battle
                                long enough to bring it near to exhaustion. That is to say, it would
                                be impossible to reach by an attack either the enemy’s coast or the
                                enemy’s fleet, and it would also be impossible to get back in time
                                to our bases if the enemy should decide to prevent it.</p>
                            <p>Without any further consideration, it appears plainly that “in regard
                                to the naval problem the possibility of absolutely mastering the
                                strategical situation belongs to him who possesses the eastern coast
                                of the Adriatic”. Italy will never feel secure in the Adriatic
                                unless <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0552"/>she can at least
                                obtain possession of the central part of Dalmatia and its protecting
                                and adjoining isles.</p>

                                        enables the enemy to have his fleet all on one spot wherever
                                        he pleases, and compels Italy to have hers split up in the
                                        places apart and very far from each other; allowing Italy,
                                        therefore, to have her fleet all on one spot in the centre
                                        of the Adriatic whilst compelling the enemy to split his
                                        forces partly towards the north and partly towards the
                                        south. We need consider the possibility that owing to the
                                        latest development of modern naval warfare, large ships may
                                        disappear, thus rendering useless large fleets and large
                                        naval bases. Torpedo boats, submarines, motor boats, light
                                        ships and all else which has combined to substitute
                                        insidious naval warfare for the classical battle on the
                                        seas, have only one object, i. e. the destruction of a
                                        fleet; if big ships cease to exist all means of an attack on
                                        big ships would also automatically disappear; they would be
                                        transformed and used as weapons against the enemy’s maritime
                                        trade.</item>

                            </p>
                            <p>But even if the whole problem did only consist in insidious warfare,
                                what would ever be the position of the nation possessing a flat and
                                low coastline, with no protection, with shallow waters readily
                                mined, with no isles, as against the nation disposing of a wonderful
                                maze of shelters of all kinds, of numberless channels, of first
                                class observation points scattered all over, of deep waters, havens
                                safe against any sea, and where sailing is possible in still waters
                                whatever may be the weather? If insidious warfare should substitute
                                surface warfare, more than ever would Italy’s position of
                                inferiority be obvious and unbearable as against the position of the
                                nation possessing the eastern coast of the Adriatic.</p>
                            <p>Neither is it correct to consider that the heirs on the Adriatic to
                                the Austrian Kingdom have no fleet at present, nor that they have no
                                intention of building one in the near future. By the Campoformio and
                                Luneville Treaties Napoleon had imposed on Austria the
                                neutralization of the Adriatic. This did not prevent Austria from
                                being, sixty years later, a naval power, capable of conducting a
                                successful naval campaign. The same might happen again
                                notwithstanding any present promise. But even if such promises were
                                kept indefinitely, <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0553"/>we learn
                                through history that only groups of nations have the possibility of
                                sustaining a war. In the event of a possible future coalition
                                against Italy, Austria’s heirs, even if without a fleet themselves,
                                could certainly put their wonderful coast at the disposal of the
                                fleet of their Allies, which would amount to the same thing as far
                                as Italy is concerned.</p>
                            <p>Now, it was largely for the very object of solving definitely the
                                wretched situation which from a strategical point of view she had on
                                the Adriatic that Italy went to war against Austria. Even if the old
                                enemy has disappeared, the geographical conditions which are the
                                basis of this naval problem still remain unchanged.</p>
                            <p>It is owing to these geographical conditions that Italy in order to
                                be safe within her own frontiers, must possess Dalmatia from Zara to
                                Spalato, as well as the isles in front of the coast and adjoining
                                it, i. e. the Lussinian and Curzolan islands. In fact, the
                                possession of these islands would be worthless if heavy enemy
                                artillery could make the anchorage and transit along them unsafe and
                                even impossible.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore clear that Italy’s claims, such as are shown in the
                                London treaty have not arisen from imperialistic claims but simply
                                from military necessity. It is not from the desire of conquering the
                                territory of others, but simply owing to absolute need for our own
                                future safety that we must ask today to be guided by what has proved
                                a historical experience from the time of ancient Rome to the time of
                                the Venetian Republic, and thence up to the present day. That is to
                                say, we must ask to be given the key to the strategical and military
                                situation in the Adriatic, i. e. Dalmatia with its isles, which have
                                always belonged to every Adriatic power which has been in a position
                                to rule its own destiny.</p>
                            <p>Even if, from a general point of view, Italy’s claims had not, in
                                respect of others, a more righteous case, it is indubitable that
                                Italy has at least won the right to priority over Austria’s heirs,
                                who up to the last moment have staunchly supported the Hapsburg
                                cause against the Entente.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Let us now consider the problem in the light of recent events, which
                                intended to revive entirely the Austrian Fleet, i. e., the fleet of
                                the defeated enemy under a new flag, thus snatching from us the main
                                advantage of our victory, which consisted in the wiping out of the
                                fleet of our old enemy in the Adriatic, where there is no room for
                                two.</p>
                            <p>The Austrian fleet has been passed on [to] the Jugo-Slavs through a
                                deed which has been signed on the one side by the legal
                                representatives of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but on the other side
                                by absolutely unknown individuals who had no legal right to be
                                recognized <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0554"/>as representing
                                a State which, up to the present time, has not been established. In
                                fact, if we are to consider the Jugo-Slavs as forming a new State,
                                legally established on a legal basis, we must remark that a new
                                State cannot definitely arise either from a defeat or from a
                                victory, and still less from an armistice. It can only be
                                established by the final decisions of a peace treaty, and by the
                                final settlement which the Powers will agree to give to the world at
                                large and especially to Europe.</p>
                            <p>It seems therefore quite obvious that as long as peace has not been
                                concluded and the new map of Europe has not been definitely traced,
                                there can be no doubt about the non-existence of a Jugo-Slav State,
                                whose frontiers, territory, form of government, responsible Chief of
                                Chiefs, laws, and all else that is essential to the existence of a
                                State, are so far absolutely unknown.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, since a Fleet cannot but be a prominent feature of a
                                State organization, there cannot be a fleet where there is no State.
                                There cannot be a Jugo-Slav fleet as long as there is no Jugo-Slav
                                State, that is to say, as long as peace is not signed.</p>
                            <p>The fleet which some call Jugo-Slav, is therefore both from a legal
                                and naval standpoint [nothing] else but the defeated Austrian fleet
                                which, in order to escape capture or surrender has arbitrarily and
                                illegally changed its flag.</p>
                            <p>It is absolutely immaterial as far as the legal side is concerned
                                whether the flag was changed before or after the armistice between
                                Italy and Austria. If it was changed before it is still doubtless
                                that it was Austria’s fleet, (namely, the fleet of the State which
                                was at war) which changed its flag. Now International Law forbids
                                any belligerent to change its flag during war, and since the
                                armistice had not been signed, we were undoubtedly still at war. No
                                one can therefore admit as legally valid any change of flag which
                                has taken place under such conditions. On the other hand, if the
                                flag was changed after the armistice, it is plain Fraud since the
                                conditions of the armistice provided explicitly that the enemy’s
                                fleet, i. e., the Austrian Fleet should be surrendered at Venice,
                                which has absolutely not been done.</p>
                            <p>Truly both the Italian Navy and the Italian Nation deserved a better
                                reward for their heroic bravery, and this reward, as far as the Navy
                                is concerned, has been snatched from them through a mean and illegal
                                intrigue. The case has been quite different in regard to the
                                defeated German fleet. In hearing of the solemn and stern ceremony
                                of the surrender of the German fleet to the British Navy one cannot
                                but feel heartbroken that a similar reward was denied to our Navy,
                                which surely had gained a full right to it through sacrifice and
                                splendid valour.</p>
                            <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0555"/>
                            <p>Great honour is certainly due to our race which, in order to avoid
                                conflicts and not to hamper the weary and complicated work of
                                settling peace, has made it possible for the Italian Government not
                                to insist on claiming this satisfaction, but in no case and for no
                                reason must this be considered as a definite renunciation, when it
                                simply means that Italy is patiently waiting for Justice.</p>
                            <p>In fact, having completely defeated her enemy, Italy has full right
                                to claim that the Adriatic should be cleared of the enemy fleet. If
                                this is not effected, all the sacrifice and bloodshed of the past
                                years will have been in vain since, after such a long and terrible
                                war, Italy would still be faced by the former unchanged conditions.
                                It is really inconceivable that the fruits of victory as far as the
                                Navy is concerned should be nullified simply by adding a blue stripe
                                to a red and white flag. This is not enough to destroy more than
                                three years’ war effort of a Nation of 40 millions, since the
                                changing of a flag does not alter the crews; and those very men who
                                have been fighting us bitterly up to the last, may be our bitter
                                opponents in the future.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore necessary, to ensure in the future a safe peace, both
                                to Italy and to Europe that the fleet of the vanquished enemy should
                                be surrendered to the victor, or failing this, that it should be
                                destroyed.</p>
                            <p>Even if this second alternative should prevail at the Peace
                                Conference, there is one point which has to be made clear and for
                                which we have to stand. We have lost through mean fraud and enemy
                                treachery two of our finest ships: <hi rend="italic">Leonardo da
                                    Vinci</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Benedetto Brin</hi>, blown up
                                in harbour by Austria’s criminal agents. Only for Justice sake those
                                two ships must in any case be replaced. Consequently, even if the
                                Peace Conference should not endorse the proposal that the defeated
                                Austrian Fleet should be delivered to Italy, (a fair and
                                proportionate part being allotted to the Allied Navies who have
                                fought by our side), and decides that it should merely be destroyed,
                                it will be necessary that at least two dreadnoughts should be given
                                to us in exchange for the two which were treacherously blown up by
                                the enemy.</p>
                            <p>Italy claims the <hi rend="italic">Prinz Eugen</hi> and the <hi

                            <p>Besides, what can be the aim of this Jugo-Slav fleet which has so
                                obstinately insisted and succeeded in remaining on the Eastern
                                Adriatic coast, notwithstanding all clauses of the Armistice?
                                Against whom can it be a weapon or a threat? Evidently not against
                                France or against England, nor yet against the United States. There
                                is therefore only one Nation left against whom under another flag
                                and another name, the long inheritance of hatred sown by Austria on
                                the Adriatic shores, shores which once belonged to Venice and which
                                still bear the marks of its splendour, would be directed. This
                                Nation is Italy.</p>
                            <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0556"/>
                            <p>Now Italy has fought this terrible war in order to break at last the
                                long tradition of hatred. It is impossible that after having
                                achieved victory she may agree to have in existence, under another
                                flag, that very fleet which has been a constant menace to two
                                generations of sailors and of patriots. Nor is it enough to take the
                                fleet from Austria (i. e. the Jugo-Slavs); they must give up also
                                Dalmatia and its isles and naval bases, without which this huge
                                conflict would remain fruitless for us, leaving our future safety
                                and prosperity in a precarious position and constantly threatened as
                                they have been ever since Dalmatia ceased to be politically one with
                                Italy.</p>
                            <p>Mere neutralisation or internationalisation of Dalmatia would also be
                                worthless. Both these measures could only be fictitious and
                                temporary remedies which would not solve the serious Adriatic
                                problem and would only bear the germs of new and painful future
                                conflicts.</p>
                            <p>The question cannot be compromised. If we, who have gallantly and
                                faithfully fought with our Allies for right and justice, are at
                                fault, let us pay for it. But if we have brought our fair
                                contribution to Victory, let us have the prize to which we have a
                                full right, and let us break without quibbles and compromises, the
                                chain which would, throughout the future, handicap our prosperity
                                and our peaceful growth.</p>

                            <p>Free business intercourse and trade, as well as industrial and
                                maritime expansion will be the essential factors of this growth.</p>
                            <p>Let us see what the conditions in regard to this provided for Italy
                                by the Treaty of London, i. e. by the compromise which was made in
                                1915 between the Italian and the Russian Governments.</p>
                            <p>Whilst Italy obtained recognition of her rights only to one
                                commercially and economically important port, the Slavs were granted
                                possession of at least seven ports of economic importance, since
                                they are the outlets of wide hinterlands. They were thus practically
                                given all the commercial outlets on the East coast of the Adriatic
                                except Trieste.</p>
                            <p>These ports are Fiume, Spalato, Metcovich, Cattaro, Ragusa, Antivari,
                                Dulcigno. Trieste is not a port whose sphere of action does
                                particularly extend to the Western Balkans.</p>
                            <p>The ports of Istria and those of Zara and Sebenico have, on account
                                of geographic conditions, merely a local function. Zara and Sebenico
                                cannot compete in any way with Spalato. On the contrary, from every
                                one of the above mentioned seven ports important lines of
                                penetration diverge and every one of them is the natural outlet to
                                wide Balkan territories.</p>
                            <p>An absolute and substantial economic predominance has thus been
                                ensured to the Slavs.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>This memorandum, which has been prepared by the General Staff of the
                                Navy, only deals with the Adriatic problem from a naval point of
                                view and does not consider the military side of the question, nor
                                any of the many other points which are all equally essential to
                                Italy’s growth.</p>
                            <p>Its object is to show that for historical, geographical, ethnical,
                                moral and legal reasons, as well as on account of urgent naval
                                necessity, our Nation cannot but claim at the Peace Conference the
                                full and uncontested control of Dalmatia as an indispensable
                                condition of the country’s peaceful and prosperous development in
                                all fields. The Treaty of London is a minimum below which it is
                                impossible to fall, whilst it admits of higher claims proportionate
                                to the function which Italy has had in the League of civilized
                                nations which were associated in the strife against the Central
                                Powers. This function has proved to be so much above any expectation
                                of our Allies that it opens new horizons for our Nation which cannot
                                escape notice by our statesmen, who would certainly not willingly
                                renounce the duty of setting them forth and insisting on them at the
                                right moment.</p>
                            <p>The Navy willingly repeats Attilio Tamaro’s fine words: “No
                                imperialism nor any wish for military domination pushes us towards
                                Dalmatia, but seek her in order to eliminate any possibility of
                                future enemy threats to us, and to assert the predominance of our
                                own civilisation which will make the Adriatic into a lake on which
                                trade intercourse will grow peaceful, active and uninterrupted even
                                should war ever break out elsewhere. Any man who is willing to
                                attain this object ought to support an Adriatic programme in harmony
                                with Italy’s supreme interests, since any man who has a clear
                                conception of geography, history and of the real conditions of the
                                peoples who at present are aiming towards the Adriatic must be
                                intimately and firmly convinced, that as long as the Adriatic
                                problem has not been fully solved so as to exclude the possibility
                                of any naval threat to Italy, our country will necessarily have a
                                new Adriatic problem to solve whenever international difficulties
                                arise in Europe.”</p>

                        <p>The news of the armistice is viewed by the Japanese press and people with
                            a detached attitude. Satisfaction is professed but without enthusiasm.
                            Newspaper comments reveal a keen interest in Japan’s aims at the Peace
                            Commissioner [<hi rend="italic">Conference?</hi>], chief emphasis being
                            laid on the necessity of securing recognition of Japan’s paramount
                            position in Eastern Asia. The advance in quotations on the stock
                            exchanges both at Osaka and Tokyo were not anticipated and indicates a
                            general feeling of optimism in economic circles. The Advisory Council on
                            Foreign Affairs met today when it is reported Japan’s peace terms which
                            have been drafted by the Foreign Office in collaboration with the War
                            and Navy Departments and the appointment of a new Ambassador were

                        <p>An adjourned meeting of the Advisory Council has been called for next
                            Tuesday, to consider further the plans for Japan’s participation in the
                            Peace Conference. The Minister for Foreign Affairs announced today that
                            he anticipated two conferences, one for the actual signing of peace with
                            the Central Powers, and another early next year for a more conclusive
                            settlement of international question[s]. Chinda or Matsui will probably
                            act alone for the present but the government contemplates sending to the
                            second conference a special mission consisting of a number of Army and
                            Navy experts and members of the permanent diplomatic service and headed
                            by a statesman of recognized prestige. The Navy has already decided upon
                            Admiral Takeshita as its chief representative. Who the others to be
                            selected are, particularly the head of the mission, is much debated. My
                            British colleague is showing <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0560"
                            />unusual interest in the subject and has discussed it with the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs. He favors <persName>Viscount Kato</persName> who
                            seems also to be the most popular choice in Japan, but his appointment
                            is doubtful for political reasons.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped by Japanese that the organization of a League of Nations will
                            offer an opportunity to assert the equality of the yellow race, a
                            question which underlies all discussions on the subject. With this in
                            mind plans are being seriously discussed for an immediate alliance with
                            China so that the two nations may work in harmony at the Conference.</p>

                            comments in the Japanese Press and current magazines on matters
                            connected with the position of Japan at the forthcoming Peace Conference
                            and other related questions. While these comments are of the same
                            character and scope as the earlier ones that have already been forwarded
                            they show more fully and definitely what the Japanese public expects and
                            desires in the way of a settlement after the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kiroku Hayashi, M. P.</persName>, considers the disposal of
                            Kiaochow Bay the foremost among the questions affecting Japan
                            exclusively. The abandonment of this territory by Germany he declares is
                            of paramount importance for the preservation and peace of the Far East.
                            He is, however, one of those who believe that the question of restoring
                            [it?] to China should not be left to the Peace Conference, as it is a
                            matter that concerns only China and Japan.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Mutsumami</persName>, of the Imperial University, has no
                            doubt that the two countries, being of the same race and having a common
                            medium of writing, can reach a satisfactory solution by themselves as to
                            its disposal.</p>
                        <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0561"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Terao</persName>, a leading authority on International Law,
                            voices a widely prevailing desire in proposing that Japan secure a lease
                            on Tsingtao for a certain period, keeping in mind the object of
                            restoring it to China eventually.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Baron Shibusawa</persName>, Japan’s eminent financier, wants
                            for Japan a recognized position of absolute superiority in China. He
                            declares that, while the relations of other powers to China are those of
                            interest, the relations of Japan are more vital, affecting her
                            existence, and therefore she cannot place her interests on a par with
                            those of other powers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Oishi</persName>, a former leader of the Kenseikai Party,
                            asks for special recognition only in respect to Manchuria and Mongolia,
                            so that Japan can make herself secure from the possibility of
                            post-bellum economic rivalries of the powers in those regions.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Siberia, the <hi rend="italic">Yamato</hi> advocates that
                            Japan insist at the Peace Conference on having Vladivostock converted
                            into a free port; that the Chinese Eastern Railway be placed under
                            Japanese control; and that other Siberian Railways under the joint
                            control of the Allied Powers.</p>
                        <p>With regard to a League of Nations, Mr. <persName>Hayashi</persName>
                            believes that, while it will be a gratifying achievement for the sake of
                            the world’s peace, care must be taken to remove artificial barriers that
                            may hinder the peaceful development of individual nations. The
                            preservation of the territorial <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                            indefinitely will be, he states, a source of affliction to nations with
                            limited areas that contemplate future development, the progress of
                            mankind and the development of states will thus be obstructed. Indeed
                            the idea that the League of Nations will circumscribe rather than assist
                            weak and poor nations in achieving their manifest destiny is widely
                            prevalent among Japanese publicists.</p>
                        <p>The limitation of armaments does not meet with much favor in Japan. The
                                <hi rend="italic">Kokumin</hi> asserts that it is doubtful whether
                            Great Britain and America will consent to break up their warships and
                            use the steel for other purposes, and points out that the Japanese Army
                            is to Japan what Navies are to Britain and America. Even <persName>Baron
                                Shibusawa</persName> advises the nations to be ready for America,
                            the Champion of Democracy, lest she make it a part of her policy to
                            check Japan’s military expansion in the future.</p>
                        <p>There is in fact general fear of America’s growing power, and distrust of
                            her motives. The <hi rend="italic">Chuwo</hi> warns America that if she
                            becomes conceited and attributes the defeat of the enemy to her own
                            strength, assuming at the same time a positive attitude in world
                            affairs, she will be doomed as Germany is now doomed. If she recklessly
                            attempts to display her strength, this journal concludes, the result
                            will be the unhappiness of mankind.</p>
                        <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>The conviction is general that Japan has much at stake in the
                            deliberations of the Peace Conference, not only in respect to the
                            specific terms that affect Japan exclusively, but also in regard to
                            general questions of post-bellum reconstruction. It is argued that Japan
                            must take a leading part in the problems that affect the Far East,
                            particularly in view of the fact, as the <hi rend="italic">Kokumin</hi>
                            points out, that the fate of the Yellow Race depends upon the attitude
                            of Japan. While Japan has not been formerly [<hi rend="italic"
                                >formally?</hi>] entrusted with representing the Race, this journal
                            observes, it is a question whether China’s voice will be effective,
                            because the value of her part in the war is not generally recognized,
                            and also because her war aims are not clear.</p>

                                    Powers, all traces pro-German sentiment have at least
                                    temporarily disappeared, showing that its former strength was at
                                    the same time its weakness. That is to say, this propaganda was
                                    largely the work of militarists and German educated university
                                    professors, whose prestige depended upon preserving institutions
                                    of a German pattern and therefore it became thoroughly
                                    discredited as soon as it could no longer be demonstrated that
                                    Germany was worthy of emulation or expedient to cultivate on
                                    account of her strength. In this connection it is significant
                                    that none of the Peace Conference delegates on the part of Japan
                                    are classed as belonging to the German school. At the present
                                    moment I can trace no influences here which would indicate
                                    German origin. <persName corresp="#p_MRS1"

                        <p>In a contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Kokumin</hi> of January 1st,
                            Marquis Okuma states that permanent peace cannot be achieved without
                            first solving the question of the equality of treatment of races and the
                            question of armaments. He asks how America proposes to treat in future
                            the alien races in her territory, and expresses the hope that American
                            public opinion will adopt a generous attitude toward this question. At
                            the same time he insists that Japanese emigrants be freely allowed to
                            enter every country. He further hopes that in order to act [<hi
                                rend="italic">secure</hi>] a permanent peace the powers will avoid
                            severe tariff wars. In connection with the question of armaments, the
                            Marquis asks how America’s new naval program and Great Britain’s
                            insistence on naval supremacy can be reconciled with the declarations of
                            these countries. He hopes that the press reports to the effect that
                            Congress has disapproved of President <persName corresp="#p_WW1"
                                >Wilson</persName>’s fourteen fundamental terms are without

                            due to arrive Marseilles early in March.</p>
                        <p>Prince <persName>Konoye</persName>, in a contribution to <hi
                                rend="italic">Japan and the Japanese</hi>, a fortnightly magazine,
                            urges that Japan should lend no ears to a peace based on Anglo-American
                            interests alone, because economic imperialism with which these powers
                            threaten the world is no less a menace to the free development of
                            nations than military imperialism. He therefore regrets that Japanese
                            are inclined to accept without discount or examination the democracy and
                            humanitarianism advocated by British and American statesmen. While not
                            opposing a league of nations based on justice and humanity in the strict
                            sense, he thinks that if one such as favored by America and Great
                            Britain is formed, the two powers will have the lion’s share of the
                            advantages, while others, deprived of the arms to resist their economic
                            aggression, will be obliged to submit to the lead of these two powers.
                            If Great Britain closes her colonies to foreign countries, how can Japan
                            maintain her existence with her limited territory, slender resources and
                            poorly equipped factories? Under such circumstances Japan will be
                            obliged to assume the same attitude as Germany before the war and
                            destroy the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. Prince
                                <persName>Konoye</persName> further insists that the discriminatory
                            treatment accorded to yellow race in America and British colonies must
                            be removed. It is worthy of note that Prince
                            <persName>Konoye</persName>’s views are shared by a number of
                            publicists.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>International civilization having proved a failure because there has not been
                        constructed a fabric of law to which nations have yielded with the same
                        obedience and deference as individuals submit to intra-national laws, and
                        because public opinion has sanctioned unmoral acts relating to international
                        affairs, it is the purpose of the States signatory to this Convention to
                        form a League of Nations having for its purpose the maintenance throughout
                        the world of peace, security, progress and orderly government. Therefore it
                        is agreed as follows:</p>
                    <p>Article 1. The same standards of honor and ethics shall prevail
                        internationally and in affairs of nations as in other matters. The agreement
                        or promise of a Power shall be inviolate.</p>
                    <p>Article 2. No official of a Power shall, either directly or by indirection on
                        behalf of his Government, be expected or permitted to act or communicate
                        other than consistently with the truth, the honor and the obligation of the
                        power which he represents.</p>
                    <p>Article 3. Any attempt by a Power, either openly or in secret, whether by
                        propaganda or otherwise, to influence one Power or nation against another
                        shall be deemed dishonorable.</p>
                    <p>Article 4. Any open or direct inquiry regarding the acts or purposes of a
                        Power may be made by another Power as of course, and shall be regarded as an
                        act of friendship tending to promote frankness in international relations,
                        but any secret inquiry to such end shall be deemed dishonorable.</p>
                    <p>Article 5. Any war or threat of war is a matter of concern to the League of
                        Nations, and to the Powers, members thereof.</p>
                    <p>Article 6. The Ambassadors and Ministers of the Contracting Powers to X and
                        the Minister for Foreign Affairs of X shall act as the respective delegates
                        of the Powers in the League of Nations. <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498"
                            facs="0568"/>The meetings of the delegates shall be held at the seat of
                        government of X, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of X shall be the
                        presiding officer.</p>
                    <p>If the delegates deem it necessary or advisable, they may meet temporarily at
                        the seat of government of Y or Z, in which case the Ambassador or Minister
                        to X of the country in which the meeting is held, shall be the presiding
                        officer <hi rend="italic">pro tempore.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Article 7. The Delegates shall meet in the interests of peace whenever war is
                        rumored or threatened, and also whenever a Delegate of any power shall
                        inform the Delegates that a meeting in the interests of peace is
                        advisable.</p>
                    <p>Article 8. The Delegates shall also meet at such other times as they shall
                        from time to time determine.</p>
                    <p>Article 9. The Delegates shall regulate their own procedure and may appoint
                        committees to inquire and report. The Delegates shall constitute a
                        Secretariat and fix the duties thereof and all expenses of the Secretariat
                        shall be paid by the Contracting Powers as the Delegates may determine. In
                        all matters covered by this article the Delegates may decide by the votes of
                        a majority of the Contracting Powers represented.</p>
                    <p>Article 10. An International Court composed of not more than fifteen members
                        shall be constituted, which shall have jurisdiction to determine any
                        difference between nations which has not been settled by diplomacy,
                        arbitration, or otherwise, and which relates to the existence,
                        interpretation, or effect of a treaty, or which may be submitted by consent,
                        or which relates to matters of commerce, including in such matters, the
                        validity or effect internationally of a statute, regulation or practice. The
                        Delegates may at their discretion submit to the Court such other questions
                        as may seem to them advisable.</p>
                    <p>The judges of the International Court, shall, both originally and from time
                        to time as vacancies may occur, be chosen by the Delegates. A judge of the
                        International Court shall retire from office when he shall have reached the
                        age of seventy-two years, and may be so retired at any time by a vote of two
                        thirds of the Delegates, but in case of retirement of a judge from office,
                        the salary paid to him shall be continued to be so paid during his natural
                        life.</p>
                    <p>A judge may be removed by a vote of two thirds of the Delegates. The
                        International Court shall formulate its own rules of procedure.</p>
                    <p>Article 11. Any difference between nations relating to matters of commerce
                        and which involves the validity or effect internationally of a statute,
                        regulation or practice, shall, if the Power having adopted such statute,
                        regulation or practice so request, be submitted to its highest national
                        court for decision, before submission to the International Court.</p>
                    <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0569"/>
                    <p>Article 12. The highest national court of each Contracting Power shall have
                        jurisdiction to hear and finally determine any international dispute which
                        may be submitted by consent for its decision.</p>
                    <p>Article 13. The Contracting Powers agree that all disputes between or among
                        them or any of them of any nature whatsoever which shall not be settled by
                        diplomacy and which are not within the provisions of Article 10 shall be
                        referred for arbitration before three arbitrators, one to be selected by
                        each party to the dispute and one to be chosen by two arbitrators so
                        selected, or in the event of their failure to agree to such choice, the
                        third arbitrator shall be selected by the Delegates.</p>
                    <p>The decision of the arbitrators may be set aside on the appeal of a party to
                        the dispute, by a vote of three fourths of the Delegates, if the decision of
                        the arbitrators was unanimous, and by a vote of two thirds of the Delegates
                        if the decision of the arbitrators was not unanimous, but shall otherwise be
                        finally binding and conclusive.</p>
                    <p>When any decision of the arbitrators shall have been set aside by the
                        Delegates, the dispute shall again be submitted to arbitration before three
                        arbitrators, chosen as heretofore provided, but none of whom shall have
                        previously acted as such and the decision of the arbitrators upon the second
                        arbitration shall be finally binding and conclusive without right of
                        appeal.</p>
                    <p>Article 14. Any Power which the Delegates determine shall have failed to
                        submit to the International Court any dispute of which that Court has
                        jurisdiction as of course, or failed or neglected to carry out any decision
                        of that Court, or of a national court to which a dispute has been submitted
                        by consent for decision, or failed to submit to arbitration any dispute
                        pursuant to Article 13 hereof, or failed to carry out any decision of the
                        arbitrators, shall thereupon lose and be deprived of all rights of commerce
                        and intercourse with the Contracting Powers.</p>
                    <p>Article 15. If any Power shall declare war or begin hostilities before
                        submitting a dispute with another Power as the case may be, either to the
                        International Court or to Arbitrators, as herein provided, or shall declare
                        war or begin hostilities in regard to any dispute which has been decided
                        adversely to it by said Court or by Arbitrators or pursuant to Article 12
                        hereof, as the case may be, the Contracting Powers shall not only cease all
                        commerce and intercourse with that Power as in Article 14 provided, but
                        shall also arrange to blockade and close the frontiers of that power to
                        commerce and intercourse with the world.</p>
                    <p>Article 16. As regards disputes between one of the Contracting Powers and a
                        Power not a party to this Convention, the Contracting Power shall endeavor
                        to obtain submission of the dispute to judicial decision or to arbitration.
                        If the other state will not agree to submit the dispute to judicial decision
                        or to arbitration the Contracting <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0570"
                        />Powers shall bring it before the Delegates. In the latter event the
                        Delegates shall in the name of the League of Nations invite the state not a
                        party to this Convention to become <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> a party and
                        to submit its case to judicial decision or to arbitration and in such case
                        the provisions hereinbefore contained shall be applicable to the dispute
                        both against and in favor of such state in all respects as if it were a
                        party to this Convention.</p>
                    <p>Article 17. If the state not a party to this Convention will not accept the
                        invitation to become <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> a party, the Delegates
                        shall inquire into the dispute and shall make a recommendation in respect
                        thereof.</p>
                    <p>Article 18. If hostilities shall be commenced against the Contracting Power
                        by the other state before a decision of the dispute, or before the
                        recommendation made by the Delegates in respect thereof, or contrary to such
                        recommendation, the Contracting Powers will thereupon cease all commerce and
                        intercourse with the other state and will also arrange to blockade and close
                        the frontiers of that state to commerce and intercourse with the world and
                        any of the Contracting Powers may come to the assistance of the Contracting
                        Power against which hostilities have been commenced.</p>
                    <p>Article 19. In the case of a dispute between states not parties to this
                        Convention, any Power may bring the matter before the Delegates, who shall
                        tender the good offices of the League of Nations with a view to the
                        peaceable settlement of the dispute.</p>
                    <p>If one of the Powers, party to the dispute, shall offer and agree to submit
                        its interests and cause of action in regard thereto wholly to the control
                        and decision of the League of Nations, that Power shall <hi rend="italic">ad
                            hoc</hi> be deemed a Contracting Power. If no one of the Powers, parties
                        to such dispute, shall so offer and agree, the Delegates shall take such
                        action and make such recommendations to their Governments as will preserve
                        peace and prevent hostilities and result in the settlement of the
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>Article 20. The Contracting Powers unite in several guarantees to each other
                        of their territorial integrity and political independence, subject, however,
                        to such territorial modifications, if any, as may become necessary in the
                        future by reason of changes in present racial conditions and aspirations,
                        pursuant to the principle of self-determination and as shall also be
                        regarded by three fourths of the Delegates as necessary and proper for the
                        welfare of the peoples concerned; recognizing also that all territorial
                        changes involve equitable compensation and that the peace of the world is
                        superior in importance and interest to questions of boundary.</p>
                    <p>Article 21. The Contracting Powers recognize the principle that permanent
                        peace will require that national armaments shall be reduced to the lowest
                        point consistent with safety, and the Delegates are directed <pb n="501"
                            xml:id="pg_501" facs="0571"/>to formulate at once a plan by which such a
                        reduction may be brought about. The plan so formulated shall not be binding
                        until and unless unanimously approved by the Governments signatory to this
                        Covenant.</p>
                    <p>The Contracting Powers agree that munitions and implements of war shall not
                        be manufactured by private enterprise and that publicity as to all national
                        armaments and programmes is essential.</p>
                    <p>Article 22. Any Power not a party to this Convention may apply to the
                        Delegates for leave to become a party. The Delegates may act favorably on
                        the application if they shall regard the granting thereof as tending to
                        promote the peace and security of the world.</p>
                    <p>Article 23. A. The Contracting Powers severally agree that the present
                        Convention abrogates all treaty obligations <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi>
                        inconsistent with the terms thereof, and that they will not enter into any
                        engagements inconsistent with the terms hereof.</p>
                    <p>B. Where any of the Contracting Powers, before becoming party to this
                        Convention, shall have entered into any treaty imposing upon it obligations
                        inconsistent with the terms of this Convention, it shall be the duty of such
                        Power to take immediate steps to procure its release from such
                        obligations.</p>

                    <p>In order to secure peace, security, and orderly government by the
                        prescription of open and honorable relations between nations, by the firm
                        establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule
                        of conduct among governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a
                        scrupulous respect of all treaty obligations in the dealings of all
                        organized peoples with one another, the Powers signatory to this covenant
                        and agreement jointly and severally adopt this constitution of the League of
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>Article I. The action of the Signatory Powers under the terms of this
                        agreement shall be effected through the instrumentality of a Body of
                        Delegates which shall consist of the ambassadors and ministers of the
                        contracting Powers accredited to H. and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
                        H. The meetings of the Body of Delegates shall be held at the seat of
                        government of H. and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of H. shall be the
                        presiding officer of the Body.</p>
                    <p>Whenever the Delegates deem it necessary or advisable, they may meet
                        temporarily at the seat of government of B. or of S., in which <pb n="502"
                            xml:id="pg_502" facs="0572"/>case the Ambassador or Minister to H. of
                        the country in which the meeting is held shall be the presiding officer <hi
                            rend="italic">pro tempore.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Article II. The Body of Delegates shall regulate their own procedure and
                        shall have power to appoint such committees as they may deem necessary to
                        inquire into and report upon any matters which lie within the field of their
                        action.</p>
                    <p>They shall organize a Secretariat to act as their ministerial agency, and the
                        expense of the maintenance of the Secretariat shall be borne as they may
                        prescribe.</p>
                    <p>In all matters covered by this Article the Body of Delegates may decide by a
                        majority vote of the whole Body.</p>
                    <p>Article III. The Contracting Powers unite in guaranteeing to each other
                        political independence and territorial integrity; but it is understood
                        between them that such territorial readjustments, if any, as may in the
                        future become necessary by reason of changes in present racial conditions
                        and aspirations or present social and political relationships, pursuant to
                        the principle of self-determination, and also such territorial readjustments
                        as may in the judgment of three fourths of the Delegates be demanded by the
                        welfare and manifest interest of the peoples concerned, may be effected, if
                        agreeable to those peoples; and that territorial changes may in equity
                        involve material compensation. The Contracting Powers accept without
                        reservation the principle that the peace of the world is superior in
                        importance to every question of political jurisdiction or boundary.</p>
                    <p>Article IV. The Contracting Powers recognize the principle that the
                        establishment and maintenance of peace will require the reduction of
                        national armaments to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety and
                        the enforcement by common action of international obligations; and the
                        Delegates are directed to formulate at once plans by which such a reduction
                        may be brought about. The plan so formulated shall be binding when, and only
                        when, unanimously approved by the Governments signatory to this
                        Covenant.</p>
                    <p>The Contracting Powers further agree that munitions and implements of war
                        shall not be manufactured by private enterprise or for private profit, and
                        that there shall be full and frank publicity as to all national armaments
                        and military or naval programmes.</p>
                    <p>Article V. The Contracting Powers agree that all disputes arising between or
                        among them of whatever nature, which shall not be satisfactorily settled by
                        diplomacy, shall be referred for arbitration to three arbitrators, one of
                        the three to be selected by each of the parties to the dispute, when there
                        are but two such parties, and the third by the two thus selected. When there
                        are more than two parties to the dispute, one arbitrator shall be named by
                        each of the several parties and the arbitrators thus named shall add to
                        their <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0573"/>number others of their own
                        choice, the number thus added to be limited to the number which will suffice
                        to give a deciding voice to the arbitrators thus added in case of a tie vote
                        among the arbitrators chosen by the contending parties. In case the
                        arbitrators chosen by the contending parties cannot agree upon an additional
                        arbitrator or arbitrators, the additional arbitrator or arbitrators shall be
                        chosen by the Body of Delegates.</p>
                    <p>On the appeal of a party to the dispute the decision of the arbitrators may
                        be set aside by a vote of three-fourths of the Delegates, in case the
                        decision of the arbitrators was unanimous, or by a vote of two-thirds of the
                        Delegates in case the decision of the arbitrators was not unanimous, but
                        unless thus set aside shall be finally binding and conclusive.</p>
                    <p>When any decision of arbitrators shall have been thus set aside the dispute
                        shall again be submitted to arbitrators chosen as heretofore provided, none
                        of whom shall, however, have previously acted as arbitrators in the dispute
                        in question, and the decision of the arbitrators rendered in this second
                        arbitration shall be finally binding and conclusive without right of
                        appeal.</p>
                    <p>Article VI. Any power which the Body of Delegates shall declare to have
                        failed to submit any dispute to arbitration under the terms of Article V of
                        this Covenant or to have refused or failed to carry out any decision of such
                        arbitration shall thereupon lose and be deprived of all rights of commerce
                        and intercourse with any of the Contracting Powers.</p>
                    <p>Article VII. If any Power shall declare war or begin hostilities, or take any
                        hostile step short of war, against another Power before submitting the
                        dispute involved to arbitrators as herein provided, or shall declare war or
                        begin hostilities, or take any hostile step short of war, in regard to any
                        dispute which has been decided adversely to it by arbitrators chosen and
                        empowered as herein provided, the Contracting Powers hereby bind themselves
                        not only to cease all commerce and intercourse with that Power but also to
                        unite in blockading and closing the frontiers of that power to commerce or
                        intercourse with any part of the world and to use any force that may be
                        necessary to accomplish that object.</p>
                    <p>Article VIII. Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of
                        the Contracting Powers or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the
                        League of Nations and to all the Powers signatory hereto, and those Powers
                        hereby reserve the right to take any action that may be deemed wise and
                        effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.</p>
                    <p>The Delegates shall meet in the interest of peace whenever war is rumoured or
                        threatened, and also whenever the Delegate of any Power <pb n="504"
                            xml:id="pg_504" facs="0574"/>shall inform the Delegates that a meeting
                        and conference in the interest of peace is advisable.</p>
                    <p>The Delegates may also meet at such other times and upon such other occasions
                        as they shall from time to time deem best and determine.</p>
                    <p>Article IX. In the event of a dispute arising between one of the Contracting
                        Powers and a Power not a party to this Covenant, the Contracting Power
                        involved hereby binds itself to endeavor to obtain the submission to the
                        dispute to judicial decision or to arbitration. If the other Power will not
                        agree to submit the dispute to judicial decision or to arbitration, the
                        Contracting Power shall bring the matter to the attention of the Body of
                        Delegates. The Delegates shall in such case, in the name of the League of
                        Nations, invite the Power not a party to this Covenant to become <hi
                            rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> a party and to submit its case to judicial
                        decision or to arbitration, and if that Power consents it is hereby agreed
                        that the provisions hereinbefore contained and applicable to the submission
                        of disputes to arbitration shall be in all respects applicable to the
                        dispute both in favour of and against such Power as if it were a party to
                        this Covenant.</p>
                    <p>In case the Power not a party to this Covenant shall accept the invitation of
                        the Delegates to become <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> a party, it shall be
                        the duty of the Delegates immediately to institute an inquiry into the
                        circumstances and merits of the dispute involved and to recommend such joint
                        action by the Contracting Powers as may seem best and most effectual in the
                        circumstances disclosed.</p>
                    <p>Article X. If hostilities should be begun or any hostile action taken against
                        the Contracting Power by the Power not a party to this Covenant before a
                        decision of the dispute by arbitrators or before investigation, report, and
                        recommendation by the Delegates in regard to the dispute, or contrary to
                        such recommendation, the Contracting Powers shall thereupon cease all
                        commerce and communication with that Power and shall also unite in
                        blockading and closing the frontiers of that Power to all commerce or
                        intercourse with any part of the world, employing jointly any force that may
                        be necessary to accomplish that object. The Contracting Powers shall also
                        unite in coming to the assistance of the Contracting Power against which
                        hostile action has been taken, combining their armed forces in its
                        behalf.</p>
                    <p>Article XI. In case of a dispute between states not parties to this Covenant,
                        any Contracting Power may bring the matter to the attention of the
                        Delegates, who shall thereupon tender the good offices of the League of
                        Nations with a view to the peaceable settlement of the dispute.</p>
                    <p>If one of the states, a party to the dispute, shall offer and agree to submit
                        its interests and cause of action wholly to the control and decision of the
                        League of Nations, that state shall <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> be deemed
                        a <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0575"/>Contracting Power. If no one of
                        the states, parties to the dispute, shall so offer and agree, the Delegates
                        shall of their own motion take such action and make such recommendation to
                        their governments as will prevent hostilities and result in the settlement
                        of the dispute.</p>
                    <p>Article XII. Any Power not a party to this Covenant may apply to the Body of
                        Delegates for leave to become a party. If the Delegates shall regard the
                        granting thereof as likely to promote the peace, order, and security of the
                        World, they may act favourable on the application, and their favourable
                        action shall operate to constitute the Power so applying in all respects a
                        full signatory party to this Covenant.</p>
                    <p>Article XIII. The Contracting Powers severally agree that the present
                        Covenant and Convention is accepted as abrogating all treaty obligations <hi
                            rend="italic">inter se</hi> which are inconsistent with the terms
                        hereof, and solemnly engage that they will not enter into any engagements
                        inconsistent with the terms hereof.</p>
                    <p>In case any of the Powers signatory hereto or subsequently admitted to the
                        League of Nations shall, before becoming a party to this covenant, have
                        undertaken any treaty obligations which are inconsistent with the terms of
                        this Covenant, it shall be the duty of such Power to take immediate steps to
                        procure its release from such obligations.</p>

                    <p>1. The Association of Nations shall be composed of the signatory Powers,
                        subject to the provisions hereinafter contained.</p>
                    <p>[The rule of majorities is so prominent in this plan that it must be
                        considered whether small nations shall have an equal voice.]</p>
                    <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0576"/>
                    <p>2. The Representatives of the Powers in the Association of Nations shall be
                        their Ambassadors or Ministers at the seat of Government of x and the
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Government of x , who shall be the
                        Presiding Officer at the meetings of the Representatives of the Powers.</p>
                    <p>[Suppose the x Govt was the offender then where would the representatives
                        meet?]</p>
                    <p>3. The Representatives of the Powers shall by majority vote fix their rules
                        of procedure. Unless otherwise voted, their meetings shall take place at the
                        seat of government of x . The Representatives of the Powers by a similar
                        vote shall also fix the time of their meetings, but a regular meeting shall
                        be held at least once in each calendar year.</p>
                    <p>4. A meeting of the Representatives of the Powers shall be held upon request
                        of any member Power.</p>
                    <p>5. The territorial integrity and political independence of each member Power
                        are guaranteed by the other member Powers, severally and mutually.</p>
                    <p>[Does this statement offer sufficient elasticity for natural growth?]</p>
                    <p>6. The member Powers recognize the principle that national armaments should
                        be limited to the requirements of international and domestic security, and
                        the Representatives of the Powers shall consider provisions for carrying
                        into effect this principle.</p>
                    <p>[Does this declaration get us anywhere? Who is to determine the
                        requirements?]</p>
                    <p>7. Any dispute between or among the member Powers which is not adjusted by
                            agreement,<hi rend="superscript">*</hi> shall be submitted to the
                        Representatives of the Powers, who shall by majority vote appoint from among
                        their number a Council, which shall include among its members the
                        Representatives of those Powers concerned, and which shall inquire into and
                        make report upon the facts and circumstances of the dispute and a method of
                        adjustment thereof. The report of such Council shall be completed within not
                        more than six months from the date of their appointment.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="superscript">*</hi> Diplomatic arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Who submits the dispute? §12.</p>
                    <p>How long should diplomacy be given?</p>
                    <p>To whom is the report made?</p>
                    <p>Is any action to be taken on the report and how?]</p>
                    <p>8. The method of adjustment proposed in the report of such Council shall be a
                        final determination of the dispute, unless a Power concerned shall dissent
                        therefrom within a time therein limited.</p>
                    <p>[Suppose the report requires action by one or both of the Powers, &amp; no
                        action is taken then what?]</p>
                    <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0577"/>
                    <p>9. If a Power concerned shall dissent from the method of adjustment proposed
                        in the report of the Council, the report of the Council and the facts and
                        circumstances of the dispute shall be considered by the Representatives of
                        the Powers, who may by a vote of three fourths of all of the Representatives
                        of the Powers, determine the method of adjustment of the dispute.</p>
                    <p>[Suppose no method can secure a ¾ vote then what?]</p>
                    <p>10. The Representatives of the Powers may at any time during the pendency of
                        a dispute submitted, determine by a majority vote any measure that is
                        necessary to be taken or omitted for the protection of any interests during
                        the pendency of the dispute and before its adjustment.</p>
                    <p>11. Each Power agrees to carry into effect any determination of the Council
                        or of the Representatives of the Powers, as the case may be, in any dispute
                        in which it is concerned: the Representatives of the Powers shall determine
                        by majority vote whether any Power has refused or neglected to carry out any
                        determination of the Council or of the Representatives of the Powers, as the
                        case may be; the consequence of such refusal or neglect so determined shall
                        be the suspension between that Power, its citizens and subjects, and the
                        other member Powers, their citizens and subjects, of all treaty privileges
                        and of all diplomatic, commercial and economic intercourse.</p>
                    <p>[Time limit]</p>
                    <p>12. Any notice in connection with any dispute between or among member Powers
                        may be given, and the submission of any such dispute may be made, by any
                        Power <hi rend="underline">concerned.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>[Why not by <hi rend="underline">any</hi> power?]</p>
                    <p>13. Any war or menace of war is a matter of interest to member Powers, which
                        the Representatives of the Powers shall by offer of good offices or
                        otherwise, attempt to determine or avert.</p>
                    <p>[Does this mean after a meeting and discussion of the body?]</p>
                    <p>14. Any dispute in which both a member Power and a nonmember Power are
                        concerned may be referred by any Power concerned to the Representatives of
                        the Powers; and if each non-member Power concerned shall consent to be
                        deemed <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> a Power signatory hereto, the
                        provisions of this Agreement regarding disputes between or among member
                        Powers shall be applicable.</p>
                    <p>[Ought there not to be <hi rend="underline">adhering</hi> members?]</p>
                    <p>15. In case of hostilities threatened or commenced between a member Power and
                        a non-member Power, the member Power concerned may entrust its interests to
                        the Representatives of the Powers; in such case the course of action of that
                        member Power shall be determined by a majority vote of the Representatives
                        of the Powers, <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0578"/>and the member
                        Powers agree to support and protect that course of action.</p>
                    <p>[Suppose the member Power is the aggressor then what?]</p>
                    <p>16. Any dispute arising from events happening before the date of signature of
                        this Agreement, may at any time be reserved from the operation hereof, by
                        any Power concerned.</p>
                    <p>17. The Representatives of the Powers shall constitute a Permanent
                        International Court, of which not less than seven nor more than eleven
                        members shall sit in any case, including always the Representatives of those
                        Powers litigant. The Permanent International Court shall formulate its rules
                        of procedure and shall have jurisdiction to hear and finally determine any
                        dispute between States submitted to it by consent of the Powers concerned.
                        Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article, the members of the
                        Permanent International Court to sit in any case may be agreed upon by the
                        Powers concerned, or in the absence of such agreement, shall be selected by
                        a majority vote of the Representatives of the Powers.</p>
                    <p>[I am opposed to this method of constituting a court. This is confusing
                        executive &amp; legislative functions with judicial, which is unwise.]</p>
                    <p>18. Any decision or judgment of the Permanent International Court shall be
                        deemed a determination of the Representatives of the Powers.</p>
                    <p>19. The Representatives of the Powers shall from time to time consider and
                        recommend to the respective Governments for approval, declarations of rules
                        and principles of the law of nations.</p>
                    <p>[Is this to have no binding force? If it is not, ought there not to be
                        provision for a Congress of Nations, say every 5 or 7 yrs?]</p>
                    <p>20. Any non-signatory Power desiring to adhere to this Agreement, may deposit
                        a declaration of adherence with the Presiding Officer of the Representatives
                        of the Powers; such declaration shall become effective and such Power shall
                        for all purposes be deemed a signatory Power hereto from ninety days after
                        the deposit thereof, unless within such period of ninety days, more than
                        three member Powers shall dissent therefrom, by depositing with said
                        Presiding Officer a notice of such dissent, in which case neither the
                        declaration nor its deposit shall be effective.</p>
                    <p>Nothing in this Article contained shall limit or modify the provisions of
                        Article 16 hereof.</p>
                    <p>[System of black balling. Ought not the <hi rend="underline">reasons</hi> to
                        be given?]</p>
                    <p>21. Any member Power may withdraw from this Agreement by depositing a notice
                        of such withdrawal with the Presiding Officer of <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509"
                            facs="0579"/>the Representatives of the Powers. The withdrawal shall
                        have effect only in regard to the notifying Power.</p>
                    <p>[Should not there be a time for notice?]</p>
                    <p>22. Any provisions in treaties or agreements between or among the signatory
                        Powers which may be inconsistent with the provisions hereof, are and shall
                        be deemed abrogated.</p>
                    <p>[Can this be done in this way? Who is to pass on inconsistency?]</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The statement as to limitation of armaments (Article 6) is hardly more than
                        an announcement of principle.</p>
                    <p>The provision for legislation in international law (Article 19) gives to the
                        Representatives of the Powers authority only <hi rend="italic">ad

                    </p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">These will be considered in order.</p>
                    <p>The question of which will be the signatory Powers in the first instance
                        requires of course the unanimous consent of those Powers which do sign, for
                        no Power can be constrained to sign.</p>
                    <p>As to Powers subsequently becoming members, the provision (Article 20)
                        permits any four Powers to exclude a proposed member but does not require
                        affirmative assent for admission but affirmative dissent for exclusion.</p>
                    <p>No attempt is made to distinguish between the voting strength of the various
                        member Powers.</p>
                    <p>As to the settlement of disputes between member Powers, the Power Of Decision
                        in its last analysis is lodged (Article 9) with three-fourths <pb n="510"
                            xml:id="pg_510" facs="0580"/>of the Representatives of the Powers, and
                        in the case of a dispute with an outside Power (Article 15) the power to
                        prescribe a course of action is lodged with the majority of the
                        Representatives of the Powers.</p>
                    <p>Chiefly with a view of not permitting stale claims, Article 16 permits the
                        reservation of existing disputes.</p>
                    <p>A judicial decision of disputes by a limited number of judges is permitted by
                        Articles 17 and 18, in cases submitted by consent.</p>
                    <p>The sanctions for the decision of disputes between member Powers (Article 11)
                        are the cessation of all intercourse, whereas by Article 15 a member Power
                        is to be supported in a dispute with a non-member Power, which the Power
                        last-named will not settle amicably.</p>
                    <p>Power to make necessary decisions during the pendency of a dispute between
                        member Powers is given to a majority of the Representatives of the Powers by
                        Article 10.</p>
                    <p>A vital point in the scheme is contained in Article 21, which by giving a
                        general and unlimited right of withdrawal gives the most practical form of
                        protection to every great Power against any action or threatened action of
                        any group of other Powers.</p>
                    <p>The effect of any such Agreement on the <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine
                        and on the relations of the United States with Latin American Powers, is
                        suggested for consideration.</p>

                            </note> perhaps only emphasizes the very great difficulties of the whole
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Inevitably the difference between “economic units” and what may be
                            called, “units of sovereignty,” must be recognized. The text is not one
                            of continuous territory, for Alaska is a part of the United States,
                            Ireland of the United Kingdom, and Algeria of France. Article 1 adopts
                            the general definition that regardless of sovereignty, a “unit” with a
                            separate tariff system is a separate economic unit.</p>
                        <p>Article 2 states the general rule of equality and of the Open Door.</p>
                        <p>While possibly there might be substantially general agreement on Article
                            2 for the future, there are many existing trade arrangements which would
                            conflict with its language, strictly applied. For example, there are
                            so-called, “frontier arrangements” in Europe, and there are various
                            other kinds of reciprocal trade arrangements, sometimes between
                            neighboring countries and sometimes not. These will not be <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0583"/>enumerated, but instances are the
                            United States and Cuba and the United States and Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly by Article 3 the continuance of existing preferential
                            arrangements is permitted.</p>
                        <p>By Article 4 permission is given so far as the self-governing Dominions
                            of Great Britain are concerned, for the continuance and even extension
                            of the British policy of preference within the Empire. So far as an
                            extension of this policy is concerned, it perhaps can hardly be defended
                            on principle, and the provision has been inserted under the theory that
                            it is a political necessity.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that by Articles 2, 3 and 4 future arrangements in
                            the nature of reciprocity treaties would generally not be
                            permissible.</p>
                        <p>The question of customs unions or free trade between two or more economic
                            units is one which is extremely complex and one which it is very
                            difficult to treat generally. No objection could be seen, for example,
                            to such an arrangement between countries situated as Sweden and Norway,
                            or as Spain and Portugal, or among the Central American States or the
                            South American Republics; and, indeed, such an arrangement might be
                            highly advantageous in such cases as Finland and the rest of Russia and
                            the Balkan States, <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi>. On the other hand, a
                            similar arrangement between China and Japan would be flying in the face
                            of the policy of the Open Door, and the existence of such conditions
                            between Great Britain and India could only be regarded as exploitation
                            by the former country of the latter.</p>
                        <p>A general solution of these difficulties has been attempted by Articles 5
                            and 6, which would permit agreements of customs unions within Europe and
                            within America respectively but not within Africa or Asia and not
                            between States situated in different continents outside of America.</p>
                        <p>Article 7 is intended to prevent what may be regarded as substantially a
                            pledge of the sovereignty of a State. Its language is drawn from the
                            agreement between Great Britain and Russia in respect of Tibet.<note

                        <p>The progress of States toward what is vaguely called “Socialism” or
                            “Nationalization of industry” requires the formulation of rules of
                            international law not now existing. It is the law in the United States
                            that a State which engages in a commercial transaction cannot, when in
                            Court, escape the general rules of law by reason of its sovereignty,
                            although it may not be sued. Considering the enormous possibilities of
                            this subject for the future, it is believed that a State should neither
                            be benefited nor burdened by the rules attached to the question of
                            sovereignty when commercial transactions are involved. Article 8 has
                            been drawn with this end in view. It should <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514"
                                facs="0584"/>be added that the rule therein formulated would, in
                            respect of commercial transactions, place a neutral State in time of war
                            in the same situation as one of its citizens or subjects. The whole
                            question is one of great interest to the United States in view of its
                            present ownership (through the medium of a corporation) of a very large
                            merchant fleet.</p>
                        <p>It has been considered that the question of concessions will require at
                            least local and perhaps detailed statement in connection with the
                            particular countries.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General Note</hi>:</p>
                        <p>Under any agreement of such nature the national economic policy of each
                            country will remain for its own decision, and bounty systems,
                            nationalization of industries and Socialism generally will in fact
                            permit a country to attempt to favor its own trade or even to destroy
                            that of another. A State monopoly, run deliberately at a loss, may
                            produce results more disastrous than the German cartel system and
                            provoke counter measures.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The plan of guaranty
                        proposed for the League of Nations, which has been the subject of
                        discussion, will find considerable objection from other Governments because,
                        even when the principle is agreed to, there will be a wide divergence of
                        views as to the terms of the obligation. This difference of opinion will be
                            <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0586"/>seized upon by those who are
                        openly or secretly opposed to the League to create controversy and
                        discord.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this there will be opposition in Congress to assuming
                        obligations to take affirmative action along either military or economic
                        lines. On constitutional grounds, on its effect upon the
                            <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine, on jealousy as to congressional
                        powers, &amp;c., there will be severe criticism which will materially weaken
                        our position with other nations and may, in view of senatorial hostility,
                        defeat a treaty as to the League of Nations or at least render it
                        impotent.</p>
                    <p>With these thoughts in mind and with an opposition known to exist among
                        certain European statesmen and already manifest in Washington I take the
                        liberty of laying before you a tentative draft of articles of guaranty which
                        I do not believe can be successfully opposed either at home or abroad.</p>
                    <p>I do not see how any nation can refuse to subscribe to them. I do not see how
                        any question of constitutionality can be raised as they are based
                        essentially on powers which are confided to the Executive. They in no way
                        raise a question as to the <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine. At the same
                        time I believe that the result would be as efficacious as if there was an
                        undertaking to take positive action against an offending nation, which is
                        the present cause of controversy.</p>
                    <p>I am so earnestly in favor of the guaranty, which is the heart of the League
                        of Nations, that I have endeavored to find a way to accomplish this and to
                        remove the objections raised, which seem to me today to jeopardize the whole

                        <p>In the institution of a League of Nations we must bear in mind the
                            limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United States upon the
                            Executive and the Legislative Branches of the Government in defining
                            their respective powers.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution confers upon Congress the right to declare war. This
                            right, I do not believe, can be delegated and it certainly cannot <pb
                                n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0587"/>be taken away by treaty. The
                            question arises, therefore, as to how far a provision in an agreement as
                            to a League of Nations, which imposes on the United States the
                            obligation to employ its military or naval forces in enforcing the terms
                            of the agreement, would be constitutional.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that the utilization of forces, whether independent or in
                            conjunction with other nations, would in fact by being an act of war
                            create a state of war, which constitutionally can only be done by a
                            declaration of Congress. To contract by treaty, to create a state of war
                            upon certain contingencies arising would be equally tainted with
                            unconstitutionality, and would be null and inoperative.</p>
                        <p>I do not think, therefore, that even if it was advisable, any treaty can
                            provide for the independent or joint use of the military or naval forces
                            of the United States to compel compliance with a treaty or to make good
                            a guaranty made in a treaty.</p>
                        <p>The other method of international coercion is non-intercourse, especially
                            commercial non-intercourse. Would a treaty provision to employ this
                            method be constitutional?</p>
                        <p>As to this my mind is less clear. The Constitution in delegating powers
                            to Congress includes the regulation of commerce. Does non-intercourse
                            fall within the idea of regulation? Could an embargo be imposed without
                            an act of Congress? My impression is that it can not be done without
                            legislation and that a treaty provision agreeing in a certain event to
                            impose an embargo against another nation would be void.</p>
                        <p>Even if Congress was willing to delegate to the Executive for a certain
                            purpose its powers as to making war and regulating commerce, I do not
                            think that it can constitutionally do so. It is only in the event of war
                            that powers conferred by the Constitution on Congress can be so
                            delegated and then only for war purposes. As a state of war would not
                            exist at the time action was required, I do not believe that it could be
                            done, and any provision contracting to take measures of this nature
                            would be contrary to the Constitution and as a consequence void.</p>
                        <p>But, assuming that Congress possessed the power of delegation, I am
                            convinced that it would not only refuse to do so but would resent such a
                            suggestion because of the fact that both Houses have been and are
                            extremely jealous of their rights and authority.</p>
                        <p>Viewed from the standpoints of legality and expediency it would seem
                            necessary to find some other method than coercion in enforcing an
                            international guaranty, or else to find some substitute for a guaranty,
                            which would be valueless without affirmative action to support it.</p>
                        <p>I believe that such a substitute can be found.</p>

                            instructions, I am forwarding herewith a preliminary report on the
                            various schemes proposed for a League of Nations and Disarmament.<note
                                n="19" xml:id="d391fn19">Not printed.</note> This report was
                            prepared by Captain <persName>H. C. Bell</persName>, whom I sent to
                            London for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Captain <persName>Bell</persName> found in London a collection of schemes
                            published in 1917 under the title, “The Framework of a Lasting Peace”.
                            His report therefore omits all material contained in this book, a copy
                            of which is forwarded with the report. The report contains some
                            information of a confidential character. This was secured largely
                            through the courtesy of the Military Attaché at London and his
                            assistants, Major <persName>Winthrop</persName> and Captain
                                <persName>Dennis</persName>, who gave generous and valuable
                            assistance wherever opportunity offered.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the brief period of time which it was possible to allow for the
                            preparation of the report no attempt has been made to digest or compare
                            the various schemes. I have therefore ordered Captain
                                <persName>Bell</persName> to continue his study of the subject along
                            these lines and to make such additions to the report as may be
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>A number of books on the subject have been ordered and will be forwarded
                            to you as soon as received. Lists of these and of other books of minor
                            value accompany the report.</p>
                        <p>In sending Captain <persName>Bell</persName> to London I directed him to
                            form what estimate he could of the feeling existing there with regard to
                            the League. His impressions are as follows. A large amount of thought
                            and of study have been devoted to the subject for the last year or two,
                            and the interest has greatly increased during the last few months. On
                            the other hand there is no stabilised public opinion on the subject.
                            There are very marked divisions of opinion existing everywhere, so <pb
                                n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0591"/>that American proposals are not
                            likely to be confronted by any unified opposition. There is however very
                            general agreement on the idea that the League must be developed
                            gradually and that any attempt to form an actual world state would be
                            premature and probably disastrous. The League must be based above all on
                            an understanding between Great Britain, France and the United States.
                            There is no apparent feeling that the co-operation of Italy is
                            necessary. It is also plain that Great Britain is not prepared to
                            relinquish her sea power. The attitude of the Government is not entirely
                            clear, but there is reason to believe that it regards the whole
                            proposition rather cynically. It has had various experts working on the
                            matter for some time, including Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAJ1"
                                >Balfour</persName>’s committee, which made its report last March.
                            Careful studies of the various aspects are being made at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>I shall of course furnish you with copies of everything that Captain
                                <persName>Bell</persName> is able to produce here.</p>

                            </hi>: I have before me your Tentative Draft of an “Agreement for an
                            Association of Nations”. I have studied it with the greatest interest. I
                            shall make some comments and I shall <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522"
                                facs="0592"/>make them in the light of an incident that I am going
                            to relate to you.</p>
                        <p>In my comparative youth I served on the staff of a very wise old General.
                            His mind was very active and he was constantly dictating memoranda of
                            things that he had it in mind to do, reforms to accomplish and all that
                            sort of thing. Almost the first day that I joined him he sent me one of
                            these memoranda, on a rather important subject as I now remember it, and
                            asked me to make any suggestions that occurred to me. From a feeling of
                            modesty not always characteristic of youth it did not occur to me that
                            he really wanted my criticism; so I returned his memorandum with a
                            careful analysis showing its excellent points and only suggesting some
                            rearrangement. It promptly came back to me with the statement that he
                            knew the good points in his memorandum better than I did; that what he
                            wanted to know was the bad points; and that, to know them, he wanted my
                            criticism, even that suggested by well-intentioned foolishness or
                            ignorance, because that could do him no harm and might suggest something
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>So I am going to suggest, haphazard, whatever occurs to me.<note n="21"

                            1:</hi>—The Capital selected will probably be that of a smaller
                            government. It will not have a diplomatic representative from each of
                            the powers, because many of them have no interests there. The powers
                            that have interests there, appoint diplomats to attend to those
                            interests, qualifications for which work may not call for the best kind
                            of men for the League of Nations. The other powers will, presumably,
                            appoint their best men specially for the latter work. One set of
                            diplomats will have other work than that of the League of Nations; the
                            other set can devote themselves exclusively to this work of the
                            League.</p>
                        <p>It has been objected against having specially assigned delegates versus
                            the regular diplomats at this Capital, that the former will, for a good
                            part of the time, have no ostensible function. If there is anything in
                            what I have said above, a part of the diplomatic body will, in effect,
                            be specially selected for the purposes of the League and will have
                            nothing else to attend to. Moreover, for some years, at least, the
                            delegates will have no lack of work in trying to get some degree of
                            order into this distracted world.</p>
                        <p>But, to my mind, the real objection is this. We cannot expect any near
                            change in the diplomatic system or methods of the world. Most of the
                            diplomats will be men trained from their youth, until they have become
                            hide-bound, in governmental ideas and in the ideas of governing classes.
                            That is the very thing that we most want to get away <pb n="523"
                                xml:id="pg_523" facs="0593"/>from. A diplomat from the United States
                            is the only one, of the large powers, that could realize my conception
                            of the requirements. He is not trained in a system where all his ideas
                            have been fitted to a Procrustean bed. And his appointment has to be
                            approved by an elected representative body.</p>
                        <p>I would, rather, suggest for consideration that the delegates must be
                            specially approved by the Legislatures of their respective countries,
                            and that they must be eminent in their countries for their knowledge of
                            history, of the Law of Nations and, above all, for their proved:
                            intelligent interest in the problems of humanity. This is the more;
                            necessary since Paragraph 17 makes the Representatives constitute an
                            International Court.</p>

                            2:</hi>—I am afraid of this provision as it stands. At the moment when
                            we hope to establish the League, the number of great, really civilized
                            powers will be pitifully small. Yet with them rest the issues of
                            world-peace and world-war. It is of vital importance to minimize the
                            chances of having any one of them secede from the League. Disguise it
                            from ourselves as we may, the basic idea of the League is to begin some
                            form of government for the world in which the ideas of the best class of
                            men in the great civilized powers shall dominate, because the ideas of
                            that class of men will be subject to a more or less wise restraint and,
                            in my judgment, a wise self-restraint is going to be the saving grace of
                            the League. But I see nothing in your provision to prevent the
                            government of the world from passing into the hands of the lesser
                            advanced peoples or, at least, being to some extent controlled by them.
                            It would be a risk to the interests of such nations as the United States
                            and Great Britain that we cannot expect them to take.</p>

                            wait ten days. Yet, there might be a case of unanimous action of the
                            Representatives of the Powers and where prompt steps to carry it into

                            longer time limit, within which approval or disapproval is to be given,
                            assuming that a thing manifestly good will be promptly approved and a

                            territorial integrity of some power.</p>
                        <p>Finally, “territorial integrity and political independence” cannot be
                            “guaranteed” except by an agreement to make war when necessary to
                            maintain the guarantee. The United States may make war to do this, but
                            it depends on the will of the Congress then in existence.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I believe that a guarantee is a <hi rend="italic">sine qua

                            threatened to be violated, thereby bringing on danger of a great war,
                            the United States may be trusted to live up to her “gentleman’s
                            agreement” as a member of the League.</p>

                            consider provisions for carrying into effect this principle”. There is
                            only one way to carry the principle into effect, and that is to disarm.
                            And the burning question is, “has not this war made us reasonably ready
                            for it?” If not, God help us.</p>
                        <p>I am of those who believe that disarmament and a League of Nations go
                            hand-in-hand. When a dozen men sit around a table to discuss questions
                            fraught with all sorts of possible irritation and it appears that some
                            of them have a pistol in each pocket and a knife in their belts, while
                            others have penknives and fire-crackers or nothing at all, the first and
                            sole question is disarmament. There can be no fair and free discussion
                            of anything till that is settled. The American principle, I am inclined
                            to think, is a League of Nations with equal representation. How can you
                            have equal representation with some nations weak and others with
                            millions of trained soldiers or fleets of battleships or both? You must
                            remember that a League of Nations will be born not only from a feeling
                            of incipient international confidence and trust but also from the
                            existing feeling of international distrust. The problem would be bad
                            enough, but not thoroughly bad, if it were a League entirely of wolves
                            or entirely of sheep. It will be a problem indeed, if you try to make it
                            one of wolves and sheep.</p>
                        <p>And what will the United States have gained from the war if this is to be
                            the result? A League having some nations armed to the teeth will be
                            dominated by those nations. That is what they will <pb n="525"
                                xml:id="pg_525" facs="0595"/>be armed for. And what part will the
                            United States play in such a League? If she is going to play with wolves
                            she must have fangs and claws as long and as sharp as theirs. But, as I
                            conceive it, we fought the war more for the purpose of avoiding this
                            necessity than for any other one thing. If we want to play with the wolf
                            without becoming one ourselves we must pull all his fangs and trim all
                            his claws. The wolf is militarism and thus far we have pulled only one
                            fang.</p>
                        <p>I think we can have a League in only one or the other of two forms: a
                            general League of Nations disarmed for purposes of international war, or
                            a League of four or five heavily armed nations who will impose their
                            will upon the world and who will keep the peace among themselves only so
                            long as each thinks that it is getting its share of the rest of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I have not much fear of the result. If we do not settle it,
                            the peoples behind us will. And if our inaction or criminal stupidity
                            forces them to act it may be, almost of necessity will be, by a
                            revolutionary upheaval of all governments that may, for a time at least,
                            eclipse our present civilization. My hope is that the Americans will
                            have the courage to lead the people and, if I understand at all the
                            President’s views, I believe we will. Our peace terms with Germany
                            should provide as far as is humanely possible against a revival of
                            German militarism, and we should then and at once demand its abolition
                            everywhere.</p>
                        <p>In the subsequent paragraphs I suggest that careful scrutiny be given to
                            each one that touches on the Constitutional rights and powers of the
                            Congress of the United States. For example, under Paragraph 11 Congress
                            would have to cede to the League its constitutional power and duty to
                            regulate Commerce. I do not see how Paragraph 15 can be effective unless
                            Congress does what it cannot do,—delegate its power to make war to the
                            League. Such things might cause adverse action by the Senate on any
                            treaty.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: In drawing up the
                        provisions which, when accepted, will constitute a sort of Constitution or
                        Articles of Agreement <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0596"/>for a League
                        of Nations, I think that there is one which should be drawn with special
                        care and embodied. The absence of it would, I apprehend, provoke perhaps
                        fatal criticism in the United States.</p>
                    <p>A domestic revolution always results in very great, though it may be
                        temporary, disorder. The nature of the struggle often causes it to be
                        carried on with little regard, sometimes, to strict international rights.
                        Especially in these days of intimate commercial relations between States
                        there may be done things that will be claimed by interested parties to be
                        violations of treaty rights. Powerful interests will be invoked in favor of
                        intervention.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, growing friendly relations between States will be represented by
                        cordial friendly personal relations between the Representatives of States
                        who sit about the council table of the League of Nations. Among such persons
                        there may be an undue readiness to listen to appeals from some one to save
                        his government from destruction. It has often been urged as an objection
                        against a League of Nations that the more successful it is the more
                        inevitable will be its tendency to keep everything on the dead-level of the
                            <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. I think that a wise self-restraint
                        will be the saving grace of the League. Yet, the more its governments
                        approximate each other in character the more will be the tendency to
                        co-operate in efforts to prevent changes in any one of them.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I think that some provision should be made to prevent abuse<note

                    <p>There are two forms of agreement which may be employed in effecting a union
                        of the nations to prevent aggressions and international wars.</p>
                    <p>One is a joint guaranty of the parties to preserve the territorial integrity
                        and political independence of every party to the agreement.</p>
                    <p>The other is a covenant, several rather than joint in nature, not to violate
                        the territorial integrity and political independence of any party to the
                        agreement.</p>
                    <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0597"/>
                    <p>The first form binds a party to do a certain thing; the second form binds a
                        party not to do a certain thing. The first requires action if necessary; the
                        second requires inaction.</p>
                    <p>Under the positive guaranty the parties would be bound, under certain
                        conditions, to employ coercion either of a martial or of a commercial
                        character.</p>
                    <p>Under the negative covenant the violation of its undertaking by one of the
                        parties would be self-operative, constituting an unfriendly act against all
                        other parties, since the offending party would assume a right relinquished
                        by others. It could be provided that the abrogation of treaties and the
                        severance of diplomatic and consular relations should follow as a matter of
                        course, and the necessity of positive action for the restoration of rights
                        violated left discretionary with the parties in council assembled.</p>
                    <p>Opposition to the positive guaranty has appeared in the various quarters at
                        home and abroad. Governments in general appear loath to bind their countries
                        to definite action which may necessitate the use of their armed forces or
                        compel an interruption of their commerce and trade. Numerous objections have
                        been raised, some valid, some invalid, and these objections are seized upon
                        and used by those who disbelieve or are hostile to a League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>In the United States the positive guaranty is also opposed for national
                        reasons. Its opponents declare that the treaty-making power cannot take from
                        Congress the war-making and commerce-regulating powers delegated to it by
                        the Constitution; that to agree to joint coercion of an American republic
                        would permit an interference with American affairs by European nations and
                        destroy the <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine and Pan-Americanism; and
                        that to bind the United States to unite in coercive measures would be
                        violative of the traditional policy of the United States to abstain from
                        “entangling alliances” with European governments. There can be little doubt
                        but that these arguments have won many supporters in Congress and among the
                        people at large.</p>
                    <p>The negative covenant, which would seem to be effective in reaching the end
                        sought, has internationally the advantage that no power could give a
                        satisfactory explanation of refusing to make it. It has also the same basis
                        as the so-called “Peace Treaties” in its self-denying character, to which
                        most nations are parties.</p>
                    <p>From the purely American opposition it removes the argument of
                        unconstitutionality, of infringement of the <persName>Monroe</persName>
                        Doctrine and Pan-Americanism, and of any abandonment of abstention from
                        foreign alliances.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that it is especially desirable for the success of the League
                        of Nations that every independent state in the world should become a member
                        and share in the burdens and assume the responsibilities which membership
                        imposes.</p>
                    <p>In order to bring this about the means of becoming a member by a nation which
                        is not a signatory ought to be made easy. That is the authority should be
                        given for a government to deposit with the Secretariat of the International
                        Council an instrument of adherence accompanied by approving declarations of
                        the act formally issued by at least three members of the League. Every
                        member of the League should be forthwith notified of the act and if, within
                        thirty days after notification, a member of the League has not filed a
                        protest to the adherence, the nation filing the instrument of adherence
                        shall be notified that it is a member of the League and shall become subject
                        to all the provisions of the Treaty as fully as a signatory power.</p>
                    <p>In the event that a member of the League protests against the adherence of an
                        applicant nation, then the matter of admission to the League shall remain in
                        abeyance pending favorable action by a three-fourths vote of the
                        International Council.</p>
                    <p>To further safeguard the League from the admission of unstable and therefore
                        undesirable members it might be provided that the instrument of adherence of
                        no government shall be received unless at least ten members of the League
                        have diplomatic relations with it or have formally recognized it as the <hi
                            rend="italic">de jure</hi> government of the nation seeking membership.
                        Such a provision would prevent belligerent governments from attempting
                        adherence and avoid premature application by revolutionary or provisional
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>The benefits obtained by the provisions of the Treaty, namely, the protective
                        covenant of sovereign rights, the interposition of the International
                        Council, the recourse to the Arbitral Tribunal, etc., should <pb n="532"
                            xml:id="pg_532" facs="0602"/>be limited to members of the League. If
                        provisions are inserted in the Treaty which directly or indirectly confer
                        any of these benefits on a nation which is not a member of the League, even
                        though the denial of the benefit might disturb the peace of the world, a
                        nation would be in a more advantageous position by remaining outside the
                        League, for it would in no way be bound to observe the self-denying
                        provisions of the treaty. In a word, a non-member would possess the
                        privileges and assume none of the obligations.</p>
                    <p>To make the League universal the policy should be—No benefit without the
                        responsibilities.</p>

                            is sure to come up at the Conference and will probably assume an
                            important aspect. As you know I have been Chairman of a Committee which
                            has been making investigations along this line. Other members of the
                            Committee are Major-General Squires, U. S. A., Captain

                            recommendations. These will be forwarded to you in due time, but I feel
                            that the subject is one of such importance and so little understood
                            generally that you may be glad to get a short memorandum which will

                        <p>24. Your 33, December 16, to Ammission. You will say very confidentially
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GS1">Gompers</persName> that the
                            President’s views were that a labor conference might very properly be
                            held in Paris or in any other place at any time that the leaders of
                            labor deemed it wise; that is, he believed that they should feel
                            entirely free to do what they conceived best. Please inform <persName
                                corresp="#p_GS1">Gompers</persName> that this, of course, is for his

                        <p>86. For the Secretary of State. Your 24, December 18. Please tell the
                            President that <persName corresp="#p_GS1">Gompers</persName> is disposed
                            to call a labor conference <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0610"/>to
                            be held in Paris and put the burden on the foreign Governments of
                            refusing to let it take place. I gave him the President’s message and
                            suggested to him that it would be better to wait and try to arrange
                            matter with the foreign governments as they might now see the
                            advisability of holding this conference in Paris.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that it would be very dangerous to hold conference in
                            neutral country as there would be a chance of its being captured by the
                            extremists and Bolsheviks. Please let me know if any progress is being
                            made in these negotiations so I can keep <persName corresp="#p_GS1"
                                >Gompers</persName> quiet.</p>
                        <p>As soon as he issues call for a conference he and his associates will go
                            to Paris. Am forwarding for him today a message to the President.</p>

                        <p>87. For the President from <persName corresp="#p_GS1">Gompers</persName>.
                            The attitude of those governments which interpose objections or place
                            obstacles in the way of my issuing for American Federation of Labor,
                            invitation to labor for concurrent international conference at the same
                            time and place where the official peace commissioners are to meet, is
                            not only unjust but most unwise and calculated to react most
                            injuriously. If the labor conference is not permitted to take place at
                            Paris, the Italian, British, French and our own so-called radicals will
                            be given the seeming justification to demonstrate that freedom of
                            assemblage and speech is denied by the governments claiming to be
                            democratic; they will charge the American labor movement with having
                            deceived labor of the world into the belief that an opportunity would be
                            afforded to discuss world labor problems and to aid in their rational
                            solution. Persistence in this course by Allied Governments may make
                            impossible American labor coming to Paris and there rendering
                            assistance. Indeed the American Federation of Labor will be humiliated
                            and made the laughing stock of the world. If objection is removed
                            American labor delegation myself included can leave United States soon
                            and remain in Paris until official Peace Conference convenes and be of
                            some service and thereafter meet with the labor conference and help to
                            guide the conference aright.</p>

                        <p>It seems to be generally understood that there will be a meeting of the
                            Delegates of the Allied Nations prior to the assembling of the Peace
                            Conference for the purpose of coming into agreement on a program and
                            plan of procedure.</p>
                        <p>Diplomatic correspondence is now being conducted with Great Britain and
                            France relative to the withdrawal of those Governments from the present
                            Receivership in Liberia and from participation in the proposed financial
                            aid to be granted to Liberia by the United States for rehabilitating and
                            developing the natural resources of that Republic. This loan-credit is
                            granted to Liberia in much the same way that others have been granted to
                            the other Allied Nations.</p>
                        <p>Because of difficulties of transportation the Delegates from Liberia will
                            be somewhat late in assembling.</p>
                        <p>From correspondence recently received from Great Britain, it would appear
                            that an attempt will be made to have the whole subject of Liberian
                            questions brought up for settlement at the Peace Conference and possibly
                            at the prior meeting of the Allied Delegates.</p>
                        <p>It is respectfully suggested that the Delegates of the United States be
                            advised of these facts and that they be asked, on behalf of Liberia, to
                            urge that the administration of Liberia’s international obligations and
                            affairs are now in the hands of the United States and Great Britain and
                            France, and that the financial assistance to Liberia as well as her
                            future status and relations with the United States Government are proper
                            questions for decision by those three nations only, and to express to
                            Great Britain and France the hope that affirmative replies may be
                            received from those two nations to the diplomatic correspondence now
                            being conducted.</p>
                        <p>Attention should also be invited to the fact that Liberia is an
                            independent entity; a member of the Allied Nations and has contributed
                            of what she has for the common cause and has suffered likewise in
                            commerce, trade, revenue, and by bombardment; and that Liberia should
                            not be considered in connection with captured German colonies in West
                            Africa or any possible readjustment of territory. <pb n="544"
                                xml:id="pg_544" facs="0614"/>It might also be stated that the
                            Liberian question is not one to be considered in connection with those
                            of West Africa; that the United States has no designs on West Africa in
                            general, but has a very real, continuing and increasing interest in
                            Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Other items which might be called to the attention of the American
                            Delegation are outlined in detail in three other memoranda which I have
                            submitted to the Department on this same subject under even date.<note

                        <p>52. Confidential for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LR1"
                                >Lansing</persName>. We are now corresponding with Great Britain and
                            France relative to the withdrawal of these Governments from the present
                            receivership in Liberia and from participation <pb n="545"
                                xml:id="pg_545" facs="0615"/>in the proposed financial aid to be
                            granted to Liberia by the United States for rehabilitating and
                            developing the natural resources of that republic. Our loan credit of
                            five million dollars was granted to Liberia in much the same way that
                            others have been granted to the other Allied nations.</p>
                        <p>Recent communications from Great Britain indicate that an attempt will be
                            made to have the whole subject of this Government’s intended assistance
                            to Liberia brought up for settlement at the Peace Conference.</p>
                        <p>We cannot but feel that the British and French are seeking to bring this
                            before the Peace Conference in an effort to promote their political
                            ambitions in Liberia whereas the refunding of the 1912 loan by the
                            American Government has no bearing whatsoever on the questions coming
                            before the Peace Conference. It is evident from all conversations with
                            British and French representatives that their Governments are fearful
                            that the United States is planning a protectorate in Liberia to the
                            exclusion of British and French commercial interests. They have been
                            informed on various occasions that the refunding of the loan has no
                            political bearing, but is merely in the interest of good government in
                            Liberia, and that free opportunity for every one will be maintained.</p>
                        <p>We wonder whether you will be willing to say now that this is not a
                            matter for presentation at the Peace Conference, but that you would be
                            willing to discuss it in Paris with British and French
                            representatives.</p>

                        <p>67. [From <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lansing</persName>.] Your 52,
                            December 19, 4 P.M. I share your views that refunding of 1912 loan to
                            Liberia has no bearing on questions coming before the Conference. I am
                            inclined to think therefore, that it should not be discussed here but
                            that this question should be handled by the Department with British and
                            French representatives. <persName corresp="#p_LR1"

                            have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of the instructions which
                            have been given by the President of Liberia to the Liberian Commission
                            to the peace conference.</p>
                        <p>These instructions not only cover all points which the Liberian
                            Government considers likely to come under the deliberations of the peace
                            conference, and which are conceived to be matters of prime interest to
                            the Republic, but they also cover questions which probably will not be
                            treated by the peace conference. This latter class of questions relates
                            to matters to be taken up with the British and French Governments
                            respectively. The advisability of opening negotiations on these various
                            questions is to be determined, I understand from the President, after
                            the Liberian delegates have consulted the American Commission with
                            reference to them.</p>
                        <p>It is the desire of the President that the Liberian delegation closely
                            associate itself with the American Commission and work in complete
                            harmony with it on all matters affecting Liberia. On this point the
                            President laid great emphasis in several conferences at which I was
                            present by his invitation just before the Liberian delegates left
                            Monrovia.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Department has given careful consideration to the suggestion of the
                            British Government embodied in the Embassy’s memorandum <pb n="548"
                                xml:id="pg_548" facs="0618"/>of December 15, 1918, that the
                            financial aid and rehabilitation of Liberia might be considered with
                            other analogous questions at the approaching Peace Conference, and has
                            submitted these views by cable to the Secretary of State in Paris. A
                            reply has now been received to the effect that in the opinion of the
                            American Peace Mission this subject has no bearing on other questions
                            which will be considered by the Peace Conference and should be settled
                            directly among the Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Liberian question is not one affecting or involving West Africa.
                            Liberia is an independent nation, a member of the Allied group of
                            Nations, and is not to be considered in connection with captured German
                            colonies in West Africa or any possible readjustment of territory.</p>
                        <p>The United States, as the next friend of Liberia and sponsor for the loan
                            of 1912,<note n="6" xml:id="d412fn6">See <ref target="frus1912#pg_667">

                                ff.</note> has always been looked to for the establishment of the
                            necessary reforms in Liberia and the performance of the obligations of
                            that Republic under the Loan Agreement and in international affairs.
                            This has been difficult in operation under the financial entente. In
                            consequence the Government of Liberia has not been able to accomplish
                            many things which it had hoped to accomplish, the desirability of which
                            has been mutually agreed upon by the United States, British and French
                            Receivers.</p>
                        <p>The time has now arrived when the United States desires to give favorable
                            consideration to the repeated appeals of Liberia and to those of the
                            12,000,000 colored people of this country, who have evidenced a renewed
                            interest in Liberia’s affairs and are petitioning that the United States
                            Government, as the founder of Liberia and for other historic reasons and
                            ties, should give more definite assistance than has been extended in the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the exchange of notes and negotiations for the refunding
                            of the loan of 1912, this Government invited the British Government to
                            take part in the receivership. Events have now proved that multiple
                            control of Liberian financial affairs has not given the expected results
                            and benefits to the people of Liberia and this Government does not now
                            anticipate that His Majesty’s Government will interpose any objection to
                            the new proposal, as outlined in the memorandum of the Department of
                            State, handed to the British Chargé d’Affaires on November 19th, which
                            is undertaken solely in the interest of Liberia itself. It should be
                            emphasized that the new proposal of this Government is in no way to be
                            regarded as indicating that the United States has the slightest desire
                            or intention of establishing a protectorate over Liberia but rather
                            purposes to maintain its historic position as Liberia’s next friend.</p>

                        <p>Realizing that the development of the State will depend upon the
                            opportunities of trade and commerce, this Government is particularly
                            anxious that equal opportunity for trade and investment be afforded to

                            United States, England, Belgium, and Italy join a convention for the
                            adoption of rules of aerial navigation.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: My Government
                                reminds me that the International Conference held in Paris in 1910
                                for the adoption of rules of aerial navigation could achieve nothing
                                but a draft of a convention which has not been signed.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, a French Commission, profiting by the experiences
                                gained in the war has drafted another text not so lengthy but also
                                in better harmony with the present conditions of aviation.</p>
                            <p>Under those circumstances the Government of the Republic believes
                                that there would be advantage in having France, the United States,
                                England and Belgium and Italy agree to draw up jointly a convention
                                which would then be submitted to the other allies and to which the
                                neutral states might in turn be permitted to adhere.</p>
                            <p>Should the Federal Government concur in this view, the French
                                Government would be glad if one or more representatives were
                                appointed to attend a limited conference which would meet in Paris
                                at the earliest possible date.</p>
                            <p>I shall be thankful to you if you will kindly enable me to report how
                                this proposal was received by the Government of the United
                                States.</p>

                            pertain to the Peace Conference. In view of the many matters pressing
                            for immediate consideration, it appears undesirable to undertake the
                            consideration of this question at the present time.</p>

                            Tacna Arica question should be laid before the Peace Conference or
                            whether the United States Government alone should attempt to find a

                            Department feels that the interpretation which should be put upon
                            President’s statement to Peru and Chile is that the statement is merely
                            the tender of all possible assistance to bring about an equitable
                            solution of the present difficulties between the two countries due to
                            the disturbance in Iquique and that the statement is not meant to be an
                            offer to mediate the whole Tacna Arica question.</p>

                        <p>23. For the Secretary of State. Department informed by Legation at La Paz
                            that it is the intention of the Bolivian Government to send a special
                            embassy to Washington for the purpose of congratulating the Government
                            of the United States on the outcome of the war and for the purpose of
                            presenting the case of Bolivia for the acquisition of a port. The
                            Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs states that the case of Bolivia is
                            precisely similar to that of Servia, that it is necessary for Bolivia to
                            occupy a position which will enable it to communicate and carry on
                            commerce with the outside world without having to obtain the consent of
                            another country. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that there was
                            a very considerable body of opinion in Chile in favor of the cession of
                            Arica to Bolivia and he claims that a similar body of opinion exists in
                            part [<hi rend="italic">Peru?</hi>] but that it is less <pb n="554"
                                xml:id="pg_554" facs="0624"/>articulate in Peru because of Peruvian
                            grievances against Chile. Regarding the Tacna Arica question he pointed
                            out that with Bolivia placed between Chile and Peru, the peace of South
                            America would be more secure. He stated that the Bolivian Government is
                            anxious to have the United States take the initiative in the settlement
                            of the problem either by making specific suggestions for settlement to
                            the countries involved or by calling a conference of the three to be
                            held under the presidency of the Secretary of State or by any other
                            method deemed suitable by the Secretary. If under the rules to be
                            adopted by the Peace Conference nations other than those which have
                            actually participated in the war are to be allowed to send
                            representatives, it is the intention of the Bolivian Government to send
                            delegates to the Conference; these delegates will bring to the attention
                            of the Conference the problem herein referred to unless the United
                            States has in the meantime taken steps looking toward a settlement. The
                            Bolivian Government would prefer to have the proceedings for the
                            settlement initiated and presided over by the United States. The opinion
                            of the President is desired as to whether this Government should signify
                            a willingness to receive a special embassy from Bolivia and as to
                            whether the question of the desire of Bolivia for a port is to be taken
                            up at the Peace Conference.</p>

                        <p>23. Your Number 18, December 11, to Embassy. I have conferred with the
                            President in regard to the acceptance of mediation by the government of
                            Peru. Neither of us understood that actual mediation in regard to
                            Tacna-Arica controversy was contemplated, only a suggestion that the
                            present difficulty might be harmonized.</p>
                        <p>The President does not desire to make a further offer of formal mediation
                            to both countries accepting the Peruvian interpretation. I would suggest
                            that you orally express to the Chilean Ambassador the President’s hope
                            that the question may be settled by some form of arbitration, especially
                            at a time when the whole world is looking toward the avoidance of force
                            in the adjustment of international controversies.</p>
                        <p>I doubt very much the advisability of laying the Tacna-Arica question
                            before the Peace Conference here.</p>

                            understand that the United States only offered its good offices if

                            more complex because there is a measure of justice and reason in the
                            Bolivian desire for a seaport and for territory separating the rivals,
                            Chile and Peru. I doubt very much, however, whether any influential or

                            Bolivian suggestion. Bolivia would have to rely upon the United States
                            to obtain such a cession. The general principle for such settlement is
                            one which we have declared, but to obtain it I fear we would gain the
                            dislike of both Chile and Peru.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile we are being asked about an arbitration, what sort we prefer
                            and whether the tribunal should have an American on it. The decision of
                            the tribunal, however just, will be resented by one party at least. The
                            whole situation is charged with trouble which it will be hard to
                            avoid.</p>

                        <p>My own opinion in regard to this telegram is that, because of your
                            absence from Washington, it would appear to be an inopportune time to
                            send a delegation from Bolivia to the United States, but that, in view
                            of the possibility of questions arising as to the general organization
                            of the world in connection with the Peace Conference, it might be well
                            to send two or three delegates to Paris, who could, while watching the
                            course of events, informally discuss the Arica matter with you. I do not
                            think the question should come before the Peace Conference.</p>
                        <p>Will you be good enough to tell me your wishes in the matter so that I
                            can advise Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PFL1">Polk</persName>?</p>

                        <p>An expression of opinion is requested as regards the form of arbitration
                            to be suggested and as to the countries from which the arbitrator or
                            arbitrators of the dispute, presumably that between Chile and Peru
                            concerning the status of Tacna and Arica, shall be chosen.</p>
                        <p>The correspondence submitted, herewith returned, does not give the facts
                            of the incident at Iquique, the apparent cause of the present trouble.
                            It shows, however, that the Department of State has offered its good
                            offices, not formal mediation—although Peru appears to have considered
                            the offer as such,—that the Department of State has informed both Chile
                            and Peru that no formal offer of this kind was made, that the United
                            States has suggested that the Tacna and Arica affair between the two
                            countries be settled, and, finally, that it is of the highest importance
                            that a dispute between the two countries should not result in an appeal
                            to force at a time when so many nations are meeting in a peace
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the request for an expression of opinion, the
                            undersigned submit the following observations:</p>
                        <p>Tacna (including Arica) has a larger area than Massachusetts, with a
                            population of 38,000, as against 3,300,000 for Massachusetts. Compared
                            with Alsace-Lorraine, Tacna is half as large again (9,000 square miles
                            and 5,600 square miles) with a population of about one-fiftieth of that
                            of the French provinces (38,000 and 1,900,000).</p>
                        <p>Tacna is a mining district; it has substantially no agricultural
                            interests; a great part, perhaps a majority of the population are mine
                            laborers from Chile. The chief town, Tacna, has a population of say
                            12,000.</p>
                        <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0627"/>
                        <p>The population of Tacna, in 1895, or approximately at the time of the
                            expiration of the ten-years period mentioned in the Treaty of 1883<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d421fn5">Treaty of Ancon; for translation, see <ref

                        <p>It may well be argued that the question involved in the Tacna-Arica
                            dispute is rather financial and territorial than one concerning the
                            rights of peoples or one to which the principle of self-determination is
                            relevant. Indeed the financial character of the question was recognized
                            to some extent by both Chile and Peru in the Treaty of Ancon of
                            1883.</p>
                        <p>It should be added that Bolivia has acquired by treaty with Chile certain
                            rights in the Tacna district and that these rights should and doubtless
                            will be guarded and preserved in any final adjustment of the dispute
                            between Chile and Peru.</p>
                        <p>The great concern of the United States seems to be to prevent, especially
                            at the present time, a resort to force on the part of Chile and Peru,
                            and for this reason proposes a settlement of the entire question between
                            the two countries. In view, however, of the difficulty, the nature, the
                            scope, and the extent of the controversy; the difficulty, greater, if
                            possible, of framing the issues to be submitted and determining in its
                            minutest details the procedure to be followed, the care to be exercised
                            in the choice of the arbitrators if their decision is to be accepted by
                            each of the litigant nations as a final settlement of the dispute, it is
                            believed that some less comprehensive solution of the matter should be
                            attempted at this time, inasmuch as the desideratum is not so much
                            immediate settlement of the dispute as to prevent the outbreak of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned therefore venture the suggestion that the attention of
                            Chile and Peru be called to the fact that each of them (as well as
                            Bolivia) has concluded with the United States a Treaty for the
                            Advancement of Peace,<note n="6" xml:id="d421fn6">Treaty with Bolivia,

                            virtue whereof they have pledged their good faith to submit their
                            disputes to a Commission in Inquiry, and that during the session of such
                            commission, which may be of a year’s duration, neither of the parties
                            shall commit a hostile act or resort to war with the other. It is true
                            that neither of these countries has concluded such a treaty with the
                            other, but Chile negotiated such a convention with Argentina and Brazil.
                            Admitting that such action on their part would not decide the question
                            submitted, inasmuch as the report of the commission has only the effect
                            which the countries may care to give it, it would preserve peace and
                            would subject either the Iquique incident or the question of Tacna and
                            Arica, or both, to a prolonged and ostensibly impartial investigation,
                            leaving the two countries to take up and to consider the question of
                            arbitration or final <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0628"/>solution
                            of the matter when the resentment produced by the Iquique incident
                            should have passed.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion is frankly diplomatic, not judicial, inasmuch as the
                            undersigned believe that diplomacy is better fitted to adjust the
                            question in its present form than an award of an Arbitral Commission or
                            the decision of an International Court of Justice.</p>

                        <p>104. For <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lansing</persName>. Your 23, Dec. 18,
                            12 M. The Peruvian Minister in Washington has informed the Department
                            that his Government considers that the “matter in dispute” alluded to by
                            the President of the United States cannot be other than the territorial
                            controversy between Chile and Peru arising from the non-compliance of
                            Chile with the stipulation of the treaty of Ancon.</p>
                        <p>The severance of consular relations between Chile and Peru was of course
                            the coming to a head of the territorial question which has agitated
                            these countries for years. It is clear that to maintain peace in South
                            America, a definite settlement of this question is necessary; otherwise
                            disturbance[s] like the present between Chile and Peru are at any time
                            possible and in the event of war Ecuador would probably attack Peru from
                            the north and it is conceivable that other countries might be drawn into
                            the conflict. The Ecuadorian newspapers have been praising what they
                            call Chilian rejection of mediation or of interference in any form by
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties of attempting to settle the boundary dispute between
                            Chile and Peru by any other agency than that of the Peace Conference
                            would seem to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. It is very doubtful whether Chile would accept mediation or
                            arbitration of the Tacna-Arica question, the judgment United States
                            alone offer it.</p>
                        <p>2. The newspapers of Peru are making a campaign with the end in view of
                            securing the return to Peru of the Province of Tarapaca,</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">which was taken by Chile in the war of the Pacific. It
                            is certain that Chile will not consent to any arbitration proposed by
                            the U. S. Government, which should include the protocols of
                            Tarapaca.</p>
                        <p>3. If the United States succeeded in being accepted as an arbiter, it
                            would be certain that whatever the decision rendered, the U. S. would be
                            exceedingly unpopular with Chile or with Peru, or with both.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0629"/>
                        <p>4. It is very probable that any arbitral decision would have to be
                            enforced hereafter and in that event, it would be far better to have
                            other countries associated with the United States in the
                            enforcement.</p>
                        <p>5. The interests of other South American countries are so closely related
                            to hostile feeling of either Chile or Peru that an impartial
                            Pan-American settlement of the question would be difficult.</p>
                        <p>If it is considered that submitting this South American question to the
                            Peace Conference would be injurious to the hegemony of the United States
                            in this hemisphere and would be contrary to the
                                <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine, would it be advisable to
                            intimate to Chile and Peru that they should await the end of the
                            Conference, in order that they might then make use of the machinery
                            which [it] is expected the Conference will provide for the settlement of
                            international questions.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a hint to the Peruvian Government would result [in]
                            that Government’s asking the Peace Conference to take up the boundary
                            question. If the associated powers decided to arbitrate the question,
                            Chile could not well withhold her consent. If the Peruvian Government
                            proceeded in this matter, the suggesting of such a course by the United
                            States Government would be avoided and it would be a question for
                            consideration, whether such action would be a departure from the
                                <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine. There have been other and
                            Latin American boundary disputes which have been arbitrated by European
                            powers upon the request of the countries involved; the present case,
                            however, may result in the request of arbitration by Peru and in the
                            compelling of Chile to consent. If this action were taken by the
                            countries taking part in the Peace Conference, it might be considered
                            European intervention in an American question, and therefore action
                            contrary to what it has been our policy to permit in the past.</p>
                        <p>An expression of your views in this matter would be appreciated by the
                            Department, as it is believed that an assumption of a definite policy is
                            urgently necessary.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Referring to dispatch 104, urgent, January 4th, from the Acting Secretary
                            of State and considering the request for an expression of opinion as to
                            whether this dispatch modifies in any way the memorandum submitted by
                            the undersigned on December 30th last, <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560"
                                facs="0630"/>relating to the Tacna-Arica question, the following
                            observations are submitted:</p>
                        <p>Dispatch 104 very clearly points out the difficulties in the way of any
                            settlement of the boundary dispute between Chile and Peru by any other
                            agency than that of the Peace Conference itself. These difficulties seem
                            formidable and are not to be minimized.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it appears to the undersigned that it would be
                            unfortunate if this question, which is purely American, should prove to
                            be such a one as can find no preliminary solution and would therefore of
                            necessity, or at least by reason of the action of Peru, be submitted to
                            the Peace Conference, at which Peru would doubtless be represented as
                            one of those countries which have broken relations with Germany, and
                            Chile represented as a neutral.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious under such circumstances that a certain sympathetic
                            interest would exist in favor of Peru; an interest which that country
                            doubtless well recognizes.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem to the undersigned that the difficulties which have been
                            mentioned offer any obstacle in the way of the suggestion ventured in
                            the memorandum of December 30th last. Indeed it would seem that that
                            suggestion, which, if adopted, would preclude consideration of the
                            matter at the Peace Conference, is one which might be to the interest of
                            the United States to make, as perhaps avoiding any question of any
                            possible prejudice to the American views and interests relating to the
                                <persName>Monroe</persName> Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>It may well be, and perhaps should be, assumed that the suggestion will
                            not be accepted by Peru, and perhaps under these circumstances it is not
                            inappropriate to consider what further action, if any, might then be
                            taken by the United States.</p>
                        <p>If not premature at this time, it may be suggested that there would still
                            remain to the United States the possibility of presenting informally to
                            the Governments of Chile and Peru its views as to the bases upon which
                            direct negotiations between the two countries might be commenced and
                            even concluded on the question, and without elaborating any discussion
                            of such bases, it is perhaps appropriate to refer to the previous
                            memorandum of the undersigned foreshadowing the view that such bases
                            might be found in the financial bearings of the dispute, recognized in
                            the Treaty of Ancon, of 1883.</p>

                        <p>302. [From <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Lansing</persName>.] Your 104,
                            January 4, 9 p.m. regarding the controversy between Chile and Peru. It
                            appears clearly from the information contained in the above mentioned
                            telegram that the difficulties in connection with the settlement of the
                            dispute between Chile and Peru by any other means than the Peace
                            Conference itself are indeed formidable. On the other hand I feel that
                            it would be unfortunate if this question which after all is purely
                            American should be submitted in the first instance for solution at the
                            Peace Conference where it is probable that Peru would have the advantage
                            of representation as a country which has severed relations with Germany
                            whereas Chile would be represented as a neutral.</p>
                        <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0632"/>
                        <p>The great concern of the Government of the United States in connection
                            with this matter is to prevent especially at the present time a resort
                            to force on the part of the two countries involved and for this reason
                            it has ardently desired some final settlement of the entire question. In
                            view, however, of the nature of the controversy and the difficulties of
                            reaching a definite solution in the immediate future it seems that
                            perhaps a less comprehensive adjustment of the matter should be
                            attempted. It is suggested therefore that the attention of Chile and
                            Peru be called to the Treaties for the Advancement of Peace which each
                            of them as well as Bolivia has concluded with the United States by
                            virtue of which the respective countries have agreed to submit their
                            disputes to a Commission of Inquiry and that while this commission is in
                            session neither party shall commit a hostile act or resort to war with
                            each other. Although neither of these countries has concluded a treaty
                            of this nature with the other and although the procedure outlined above
                            would not decide the question submitted as the report of the commission
                            does not bind either party, such action would tend to preserve peace and
                            at the end of the prolonged and ostensibly impartial investigation the
                            question of arbitration or final solution could be resumed under less
                            strained conditions.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion outlined above is purely diplomatic, not judicial and
                            accordingly appears to be better suited to the present situation. I
                            shall be glad therefore to be informed of any views which you may
                            communicate to me on the matter.<note n="8" xml:id="d426fn8">For
