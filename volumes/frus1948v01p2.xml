                <p>Part 2 of this volume was prepared under the direct supervision of the late S.
                    Everett Gleason and of Fredrick Aandahl, his successor as Editor of <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, with the assistance of Ralph R.
                    Goodwin and Neal H. Petersen in planning and direction.</p>
                <p>Mr. Petersen compiled and edited the sections on United States national security
                    policy and on atomic energy, as well as the related section in part 1 on
                    American policy at the United Nations on regulation of armaments and collective
                    security. Mr. Goodwin prepared the sections on United States representation at
                    international conferences and organizations, commercial policy, the foreign
                    assistance program, and, with Marvin W. Kranz, on the International Trade
                    Organization and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. William Z. Slany
                    prepared the section on United States policy with regard to the Antarctic.
                    Editorial and technical assistance was provided by Margaret G. Martin and Ruth
                    M. Worthing.</p>
                <p>The editors acknowledge with appreciation the assistance provided them by the
                    historians of the Department of Defense, including those of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff, as well as by the historians of the Atomic Energy Commission (now the
                    Energy Research and Development Administration). They are also grateful for the
                    cooperation of the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, the
                    Central Intelligence Agency, and the Atomic Energy Commission, all of which
                    concurred in the declassification of various papers for release herein. Thanks
                    are also due to those foreign governments that kindly granted permission for
                    publication of certain of their documents in this volume.</p>
                <p>The technical editing of this volume was the responsibility of the Publishing and
                    Reproduction División, Willard M. McLaughlin, Chief. The index for part 2 was
                    prepared by Francis C. Prescott.</p>
                <p>Part 1 of this volume (released in June 1975 as Department of State publication
                    8805) includes documentation on United States policy with respect to the United
                    Nations.</p>

                        constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States.
                        These volumes include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                        documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                        decisions within the range of the Department of State’s responsibilities,
                        together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which contributed
                        to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                        supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper
                        understanding of the relevant policies of the United States, such papers
                        should be obtained from other Government agencies.</p>

                        the record is guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There may
                        be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the
                        text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                        importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                        concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                        policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the

                        at the latter’s experiment station near Copenhagen in October last.
                        Professor Bohr had wanted to talk to him because he knew of Mr. McCloy’s
                        membership in the Secretary’s Atomic Energy Committee in 1945–1946.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>Professor Bohr expressed considerable concern over the rift between east and
                        west which he saw becoming wider as time passed. He thought that this could
                        only lead to catastrophe and he feared for the United States in the event of
                        an atomic war because of the vulnerability of U.S. industrial concentrations
                        and the relative slowness of democratic governments in action. The Russians
                        had a peculiar psychological stimulus to develop the bomb. When the Germans
                        were defeated the Red army seemed to the Kremlin to stand invincible and
                        Soviet power incontestable. Now the coming of the bomb had dashed this
                        prospect.</p>
                    <p>Professor Bohr thought that the Russians would succeed in developing atomic
                        weapons within sixteen or eighteen months.</p>
                    <p>Russian nuclear scientists were as capable as any in the world and their
                        numbers were adequate. He knew this by personal contact with them. As for
                        Russian technology, he believed that we underestimated it, especially since
                        we attempted to evaluate it by our own standards. We overlooked the enormous
                        concentration of effort which the Russians could bring to bear under their
                        system of government by disregarding waste of materials and manpower.</p>
                    <p>In the face of this prospect Professor Bohr thought that some plan ought to
                        be offered to the Russians and that we could still “get through” to the
                        Russian people with such an offer. He believed that scientists working
                        together might produce some plan. He gave no details of what the plan should
                            be.<note n="6" xml:id="d2fn6">For information on the proposal Bohr

                    <p>When Mr. Acheson<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">Dean Acheson, Under Secretary of
                            State, August 1945–June 1947.</note> first spoke to me about the
                        Planning Staff, he said that he thought its most important function would be
                        to try to trace the lines of development of our foreign policy as they
                        emerged from our actions in the past, and to project them into the future,
                        so that we could see where we were going.</p>
                    <p>During the first months of the operation of the Staff, I hesitated to
                        undertake any such effort, because I did not feel that any of us had a broad
                        enough view of the problems involved to lend real value to our estimate.</p>
                    <p>I have now made an effort toward a general view of the main problems of our
                        foreign policy, and I enclose it as a Staff paper. It is far from
                        comprehensive and doubtless contains many defects; but it is a first step
                        toward the unified concept of foreign policy which I hope this Staff can
                        some day help to evolve.</p>
                    <p>The paper is submitted merely for information, and does not call for
                        approval. I made no effort to clear it around the Department, since this
                        would have changed its whole character. For this reason, I feel that if any
                        of the views expressed should be made the basis for action in the
                        Department, the views of the offices concerned should first be
                        consulted.</p>
                    <p>This document should properly have included a chapter on Latin America. I
                        have not included such a chapter because I am not familiar with the problems
                        of the area, and the Staff has not yet studied them. Butler,<note n="4"

                    <p>On the assumption that Western Europe will be rescued from communist control,
                        the relationships between Great Britain and the continental countries, on
                        the one hand, and between Great Britain and the United States and Canada on
                        the other, will become for us a long term policy problem of major
                        significance. The scope of this problem is so immense and its complexities
                        so numerous that there can be no simple and easy answer. The solutions will
                        have to be evolved step by step over a long period of time. But it is not
                        too early today for us to begin to think out the broad outlines of the
                        pattern which would best suit our national interests.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, the following facts are basic to a consideration of this

                                the food and raw material surpluses she needs; this problem could be
                                far better met by closer association with Canada and the United

                                this hemisphere or with Africa.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>It will be seen from the above that we stand before something of a dilemma.
                        If we were to take Britain into our own U.S.-Canadian orbits according to
                        some formula of “Union now”, this would probably solve Britain’s long term
                        economic problem and create a natural political entity of great strength.
                        But this would tend to cut Britain off from the close political association
                        she is seeking with continental nations and might therefore have the
                        ultimate effect of rendering the continental nations more vulnerable to
                        Russian pressure. If, on the other hand, the British are encouraged to seek
                        salvation only in closer association with <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511"
                            facs="0021"/>their continental neighbors, then there is no visible
                        solution of the long term economic problem of either Britain or Germany, and
                        we would be faced, at the termination of <gloss target="#t_ERP1"
                        >ERP</gloss>, with another crises of demand on this country for European
                            aid.<note n="6" xml:id="d4fn6">For documentation on United States policy

                    </p>
                    <p>To me, there seem only two lines of emergence from this dilemma. They are not
                        mutually exclusive and might, in fact, supplement each other very well.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, Britain could be encouraged to proceed vigorously with
                        her plans for participation in a European union, and we could try to bring
                        that entire union, rather than just Britain alone, into a closer economic
                        association with this country and Canada. We must remember, however, that if
                        this is to be really effective, the economic association must be so intimate
                        as to bring about a substantial degree of currency and customs union, plus
                        relative freedom of migration of individuals as between Europe and this
                        continent. Only in this way can the free movement of private capital and
                        labor be achieved which will be necessary if we are to find a real cure for
                        the abnormal dependence of these areas on governmental aid from this
                        country. But; we should also note carefully the possible implications of
                        such a program from the standpoint of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> Charter.<note n="7" xml:id="d4fn7">For documentation on
                            United States policy with respect to the proposed International Trade
                            Organization, see <ref target="#pg_802">pp. 802</ref> ff.</note> As I
                        see it, the draft charter, as well as the whole theory behind our trade
                        agreements program, would make it difficult for us to extend to the
                        countries of western Europe special facilities which we did not extend in
                        like measure to all other <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> members and
                        trade agreement partners.</p>
                    <p>A second possible solution would lie in arrangements whereby a, union of
                        Western European nations would undertake jointly the economic development
                        and exploitation of the colonial and dependent areas of the African
                        Continent. The realization of such a program admittedly presents demands
                        which are probably well above the vision and strengths and leadership
                        capacity of present governments in Western Europe. It would take
                        considerable prodding from outside and ‘much patience. But the idea itself
                        has much to recommend it. The African Continent, is relatively little
                        exposed to communist pressures; and most of it is not today a subject of
                        great power rivalries. It lies easily accessible to the maritime nations of
                        Western Europe, and politically they control or influence most of it. Its
                        resources are still relatively undeveloped. It could absorb great numbers of
                        people and a great deal of Europe’s surplus technical and administrative,
                        energy. Finally, it would lend to the idea of Western European union that
                        tangible objective for which everyone has been rather unsuccessfully groping
                        in recent months.</p>
                    <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0022"/>
                    <p>However this may be, one thing is clear: if we wish to carry through with the
                        main purpose of the <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> we must cordially
                        and loyally support the British effort toward a Western European union. And
                        this support should consist not only of occasional public expressions of
                        approval. The matter should be carefully and sympathetically discussed with
                        the British themselves and with the other governments of Western Europe.
                        Much could be accomplished in such discussions, both from the standpoint of
                        the clarification of our own policy and in the way of the exertion of a
                        healthy and helpful influence on the Europeans themselves. In particular, we
                        will have accomplished an immense amount if we can help to persuade the
                        Western Europeans of the necessity of treating the Germans as citizens of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, I think it might be well to ask each of our missions in
                        Western Europe to make a special study of the problem of Western European
                        union, both in general and with particular reference to the particular
                        country concerned, and to take occasion, in the course of preparation of
                        this study, to consult the views of the wisest and most experienced people
                        they know in their respective capitals. These studies should be accompanied
                        by their own recommendations as to how the basic problem could best be
                        approached. A digest of such studies in this Department should yield a
                        pretty sound cross-section of informed and balanced opinion on the problem
                        in question.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">ii. european recovery program</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The course of the debates in Congress now makes it possible for us to
                        distinguish with some degree of probability the outlines of the action
                        toward which this Government is moving in the question of aid to Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">1. <hi rend="italic">The administration of the
                        program</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The most significant feature of the emerging recovery program is that it is
                        to be conducted by this Government as a technical business operation and not
                        as a political matter. We must face realistically the fact that this will
                        reduce drastically the program’s potential political effect and open up the
                        road to a considerable degree of confusion, contradiction and
                        ineffectiveness in this Government’s policies toward Europe. The conduct of
                        relations with the European governments by a separate agency of this
                        Government on matters of such great importance, over so long a period of
                        time, cannot fail to cut deeply into the operations of the Department of
                        State in European affairs and to reduce the prestige, the competence, and
                        the effectiveness of its Missions in Europe.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, the possibilities for the exertion of influence by
                        this Department over the course of our relations with European <pb n="513"
                            xml:id="pg_513" facs="0023"/>countries will become predominantly a
                        matter of the extent to which it can influence national policy through the
                        White House. This means that greatly increased importance must be attached
                        to the means of liaison between the Department and the White House, and
                        particularly to the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>But we should not deceive ourselves into hoping that national policy
                        conducted through channels as round about as this, and involving the use of
                        a new and separate organization such as the <gloss target="#t_ERP1"
                            >ERP</gloss> administration, can be as clear cut or as efficacious as
                        that which could be conducted if policy-making functions continued to rest
                        clearly with the regular agencies of government. No policy can become really
                        effective unless it commands the understanding of those who carry it out.
                        The understanding of governmental policies in the field of foreign affairs
                        cannot be readily acquired by people who are new to that field, even when
                        they are animated by the best will in the world. This is not a matter of
                        briefing, or instructing, which could be done in a short time. It is a
                        matter of educating and training, for which years are required.</p>
                    <p>Our experience with <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> wartime and
                        post-hostilities agencies operating in the foreign field has demonstrated
                        that not only are new agencies of little value in executing policies which
                        go beyond the vision and the educational horizon of their own personnel, but
                        that they actually develop a momentum of their own which, in the final
                        analysis, tends to shape—rather than to serve—the national policy.</p>
                    <p>I do not think that the manner in which this aid program is to be undertaken
                        is necessarily going to mean that its basic purpose will not be served.
                        While we will hardly be able to use U.S. aid tactically, as a flexible
                        political instrument, the funds and goods will nevertheless themselves
                        constitute an important factor on the European scene. The mere availability
                        of this amount of economic assistance will create, so to speak, a new
                        topographic feature against which the peoples of Western Europe will be able
                        to brace themselves in their own struggle to preserve political
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>But we must recognize that, once the bill has been passed, the matter will be
                        largely out of our hands. The operation of the <gloss target="#t_ERP1"
                            >ERP</gloss> administration will make it difficult for this Department
                        itself to conduct any incisive and vigorous policy with relation to Europe
                        during the period in question. This does not relieve us, of course, of the
                        duty of continuing to study carefully the development of the European scene
                        and of contributing as best we can to the formulation of national policy
                        relating to the European area. But it thrusts this Department back—with
                        respect to one great area of the world’s surface—into the position it
                        occupied in many instances during the recent war:—the position of an
                        advisory, rather than an executive, agency.</p>

                    <p>The dilatoriness of the Congress in acting on this matter presents a definite
                        danger to the success of the program. A gap between the date on which the
                        aid becomes available and the point to which European reserves can hold out
                        could nullify a great part of the effect of the program.</p>
                    <p>There is probably not much that we can do, by pleading or urging, to expedite
                        Congressional action. But I think we should state very plainly to Congress
                        the time limits involved (which our own economic analysts must determine)
                        and the possible consequences of delay. Furthermore, we should make clear
                        that aid granted subsequent to the specified time limits cannot be
                        considered as a response to the recommendations of the Executive branch of
                        the Government, and that the latter cannot take responsibility for the
                        desirability or effectiveness of the program in these circumstances.</p>

                    <p>In either case, there will be charges we are trying to “dictate” to the

                        and the Executive branch of the Government will find itself embarrassed in
                        its future position if it allows itself to be forced now into accepting a
                        share of responsibility for a program of aid which it knows will be too
                        little, too late, or both.</p>

                        aid program is the concept of European unity. Unless the program actually
                        operates to bring closer together the countries participating in it, it will
                        certainly fail in its major purpose, and it will not take on, in the eyes of
                        the world public, the dignity and significance which would set it apart from

                        throughout in our handling of the operation.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The coming changes with respect to the responsibility for military government
                        in Germany provide a suitable occasion for us to evolve new long-term
                        concepts of our objectives with respect to that country. We cannot rely on
                        the concepts of the existing policy directives. Not only were these designed
                        to meet another situation, but it is questionably in many instances, whether
                        they were sound in themselves.</p>
                    <p>The planning to be done in this connection will necessarily have to be
                        many-sided and voluminous. But it is possible to see today the main outlines
                        of the problem we will face and, I think, of the solutions we must seek.</p>
                    <p>In the long run there can be only three possibilities for the future of
                        western and central Europe. One is German domination. Another is Russian
                        domination. The third is a federated Europe, into which the parts of Germany
                        are absorbed but in which the influence of the other countries is sufficient
                        to hold Germany in her place.</p>
                    <p>If there is no real European federation and if Germany is restored as a
                        strong and independent country, we must expect another attempt at German
                        domination. If there is no real European federation and if Germany is <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> restored as a strong and independent country, we
                        invite Russian domination, for an unorganized Western Europe cannot
                        indefinitely oppose an organized Eastern Europe. The only reasonably hopeful
                        possibility for avoiding one of these two evils is some form of federation
                        in western and central Europe.</p>
                    <p>Our dilemma today lies in the fact that whereas a European federation would
                        be by all odds the best solution from the standpoint of U.S. interests, the
                        Germans are poorly prepared for it. To achieve such a federation would be
                        much easier if Germany were partitioned, or drastically decentralized, and
                        if the component parts could be brought separately into the European union.
                        To bring a unified Germany, or even a unified western Germany, into such a
                        union would be much more difficult; for it would still over-weigh the other
                        components, in many respects.</p>
                    <p>Now a partition of the Reich might have been possible if it had been carried
                        out resolutely and promptly in the immediate aftermath of defeat. But that
                        moment is now past, and we have today another situation to deal with. As
                        things stand today, the Germans are psychologically not only unprepared for
                        any breakup of the Reich but in a, frame of mind which is distinctly
                        unfavorable thereto.</p>
                    <p>In any planning we now do for the future of Germany we will have to take
                        account of the unpleasant fact that our occupation up to this <pb n="516"
                            xml:id="pg_516" facs="0026"/>time has been unfortunate from the
                        standpoint of the psychology of the German people. They are emerging from
                        this phase of the post-hostilities period in a state of mind which can only
                        be described as sullen, bitter, unregenerate, and pathologically attached to
                        the old chimera of German unity. Our moral and political influence over them
                        has not made headway since the surrender. They have been impressed neither
                        by our precepts nor by our example. They are not going to look to us for
                        leadership. Their political life is probably going to proceed along the
                        lines of a polarization into extreme right and extreme left, both of which
                        elements will be, from our standpoint, unfriendly, ugly to deal with, and
                        contemptuous of the things we value.</p>
                    <p>We cannot rely on any such Germany to fit constructively into a pattern of
                        European union of its own volition. Yet without the Germans, no real
                        European federation is thinkable. And without federation, the other
                        countries of Europe can have no protection against a new attempt at foreign
                        domination.</p>
                    <p>If we did not have the Russians and the German communists prepared to take
                        advantage politically of any movement on our part toward partition we could
                        proceed to partition Germany regardless of the will of the inhabitants, and
                        to force the respective segments to take their place in a federated Europe.
                        But in the circumstances prevailing today, we cannot do this without
                        throwing the German people politically into the arms of the communists. And
                        if that happens, the fruits of our victory in Europe will have been
                        substantially destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Our possibilities are therefore reduced, by the process of exclusion, to a
                        policy which, without pressing the question of partition in Germany, would
                        attempt to bring Germany, or western Germany, into a European federation,
                        but do it in such a way as not to permit her to dominate that federation or
                        jeopardize the security interests of the other western European countries.
                        And this would have to be accomplished in the face of the fact that we
                        cannot rely on the German people to exercise any self-restraint of their own
                        volition, to feel any adequate sense of responsibility vis-á-vis the other
                        western nations, or to concern themselves for the preservation of western
                        values in their own country and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
                    <p>I have no confidence in any of the old-fashioned concepts of collective
                        security as a means of meeting this problem. European history has shown only
                        too clearly the weakness of multilateral defensive alliances between
                        complete sovereign nations as a means of opposing desperate and determined
                        bids for domination of the European scene. Some mutual defense arrangements
                        will no doubt be necessary as a concession to the prejudices of the other
                        Western European peoples, whose thinking is still old fashioned and
                        unrealistic on this subject. <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0027"/>But we
                        can place no reliance on them as a deterrent to renewed trouble-making on
                        the part of the Germans.</p>
                    <p>This being the case, it is evident that the relationship of Germany to the
                        other countries of western Europe must be so arranged as to provide
                        mechanical and automatic safeguards against any unscrupulous exploitation of
                        Germany’s preeminence in population and in military-industrial
                        potential.</p>
                    <p>The first task of our planning will be to find such safeguards.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, primary consideration must be given to the problem of the
                        Ruhr. Some form of international ownership or control of the Ruhr industries
                        would indeed be one of the best means of automatic protection against the
                        future misuse of Germany’s industrial resources for aggressive purposes.
                        There may be other devices which would also be worth exploring.</p>
                    <p>A second line of our planning will have to be in the direction of the maximum
                        interweaving of German economy with that of the remainder of Europe. This
                        may mean that we will have to reverse our present policies, in certain
                        respects. One of the most grievous mistakes, in my opinion, of our
                        post-hostilities policy was the renewed extreme segregation of the Germans
                        and their compression into an even smaller territory than before, in virtual
                        isolation from the remaining peoples of Europe. This sort of segregation and
                        compression invariably arouses precisely the worst reactions in the German
                        character. What the Germans need is not to be thrust violently in upon
                        themselves, which only heightens their congenital irrealism and self-pity
                        and defiant nationalism, but to be led out of their collective egocentrism
                        and encouraged to see things in larger terms, to have interests elsewhere in
                        Europe and elsewhere in the world, and to learn to think of themselves as
                        world citizens and not just as Germans.</p>
                    <p>Next, we must recognize the bankruptcy of our moral influence on the Germans,
                        and we must make plans for the earliest possible termination of those
                        actions and policies on our part which have been psychologically
                        unfortunate. First of all, we must reduce as far as possible our
                        establishment in Germany; for the residence of large numbers of
                        representatives of a victor nation in a devastated conquered area is never a
                        helpful factor, particularly when their living habits and standards are as
                        conspicuously different as are those of Americans in Germany. Secondly, we
                        must terminate as rapidly as possible those forms of activity
                        (denazification, re-education, and above all the Nuremberg Trials) which
                        tend to set up as mentors and judges over internal German problems. Thirdly,
                        we must have the courage to dispense with military government as soon as
                        possible and to force the Germans to accept responsibility once more for
                        their own affairs. They will never begin to do this as long as we will
                        accept that responsibility for them.</p>
                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0028"/>
                    <p>The military <hi rend="italic">occupation</hi> of western Germany may have to
                        go on for a long time. We may even have to be prepared to see it become a
                        quasi-permanent feature of the European scene. But military <hi
                            rend="italic">government</hi> is a different thing. Until it is removed,
                        we cannot really make progress in the direction of a more stable Europe.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we must do everything possible from now on to coordinate our policy
                        toward Germany with the views of Germany’s immediate western neighbors. This
                        applies particularly to the Benelux countries, who could probably easily be
                        induced to render valuable collaboration in the implementation of our own
                        views. It is these neighboring countries who in the long run must live with
                        any solutions we may evolve; and it is absolutely essential to any
                        successful ordering of western Europe that they make their full contribution
                        and bear their full measure of responsibility. It would be better for us in
                        many instances to temper our own policies in order to win their support than
                        to try to act unilaterally in defiance of their feelings.</p>
                    <p>With these tasks and problems before us it is important that we should do
                        nothing in this intervening period which would prejudice our later policies.
                        The appropriate offices of the Department of State should be instructed to
                        bear this in mind in their own work. We should also see to it that it is
                        borne in mind by our military authorities in the prosecution of their
                        policies in Germany. These considerations should be observed in any
                        discussions we hold with representatives of other governments. This applies
                        particularly to the forthcoming discussions with the French and the
                        British.</p>

                            xml:id="pg_519" facs="0029"/>in foreign countries. This poses an
                        extremely difficult problem as to the measures which our Government can take
                        to prevent the communists from achieving success in the countries where
                        resistance is lowest.</p>
                    <p>The Planning Staff has given more attention to this than to any single
                        problem which has come under its examination. Its conclusions may be summed
                        up as follows: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The use of U.S. regular armed force to oppose the efforts of
                                indigenous communist elements within foreign countries must
                                generally be considered as a risky and profitless undertaking, apt
                                to do more harm than good.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>If, however, it can be shown that the continuation of communist
                                activities has a tendency to attract U.S. armed power to the
                                vicinity of the affected areas, and if these areas are ones from
                                which the Kremlin would definitely wish U.S. power excluded, there
                                is a possibility that this may bring into play the defensive
                                security inter-tests of the Soviet Union and cause the Russians to
                                exert a restraining influence on local communist forces.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Staff has therefore felt that the wisest policy for us to follow would be
                        to make it evident to the Russians by our actions that the further the
                        communists go in Greece and Italy the more surely will this Government be
                        forced to extend the deployment of its peacetime military establishment in
                        the Mediterranean area.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt in our minds but that if the Russians knew that the
                        establishment of a communist government in Greece would mean the
                        establishment of U.S. air bases in Libya and Crete, or that a communist
                        uprising in northern Italy would lead to the renewed occupation by this
                        country of the Foggia field, a conflict would be produced in the Kremlin
                        councils between the interests of the Third Internationale, on the one hand,
                        and those of the sheer military security of the Soviet Union, on the other.
                        In conflicts of this sort, the interests of narrow Soviet nationalism
                        usually win. If they were to win in this instance, a restraining hand would
                        certainly be placed on the Greek and Italian communists.</p>
                    <p>This has already been, to some extent, the case. I think there is little
                        doubt that the activity of our naval forces in the Mediterranean (including
                        the stationing of further Marines with those forces), plus the talk of the
                        possibility of our sending U.S. forces to Greece, has had something to do
                        with the failure of the satellites, up to this time, to recognize the Markos
                        Government, and possibly also with the Kremlin’s reprimand to Dimitrov.
                        Similarly, I think the statement we made at the time of the final departure
                        of our troops from Italy was probably the decisive factor in bringing about
                        the abandonment of the plans which evidently existed for a communist
                        uprising in Italy prior to the spring elections.</p>
                    <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0030"/>
                    <p>For this reason, I think that our policy with respect to Greece and Italy,
                        and the Mediterranean area in general, should be based upon the objective of
                        demonstration to the Russians that: <list>

                        them here. But there are two background considerations of determining
                        importance, both for the Palestine question and for our whole position in
                        the Middle East, which I should like to emphasize at this time.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">1. <hi rend="italic">The British strategic position in the
                            Middle East</hi>.</p>
                    <p>We have decided in this Government that the security of the Middle East is
                        vital to our own security. We have also decided that it would not be
                        desirable or advantageous for us to attempt to duplicate or to take over the
                        strategic facilities now held by the British in that area. We have
                        recognized that these facilities would be at our effective disposal anyway,
                        in the event of war, and that to attempt to get them transferred, in the
                        formal sense, from the British to ourselves would only raise a host of new
                        and unnecessary problems, and would probably be generally unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>This means that we must do what we can to support the maintenance of the
                        British of their strategic position in that area. This does <hi
                            rend="italic">not mean</hi> that we must support them in every
                        individual instance. It does <hi rend="italic">not mean</hi> that we must
                        back them up in cases where they have got themselves into a false position
                        or where we would thereby be undertaking extravagant political commitments.
                        It <hi rend="italic">does mean</hi> that any policy on our part which tends
                        to strain British relations with the Arab world and to whittle down the
                        British position in the Arab countries is only a policy directed against
                        ourselves and against the immediate strategic interests of our country.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">2. <hi rend="italic">The direction of our own
                        policy</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The pressures to which this Government is now subjected are ones which impel
                        us toward a position where we would shoulder major responsibility for the
                        maintenance, and even the expansion, of a Jewish state in Palestine. To the
                        extent that we move in this direction, we will be operating directly counter
                        to our major security interests <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0031"/>in
                        that area. For this reason, our policy in the Palestine issue should be
                        dominated by the determination to avoid being impelled along this path.</p>
                    <p>We are now heavily and unfortunately involved in this Palestine question. We
                        will apparently have to make certain further concessions to our past
                        commitments and to domestic pressures.</p>
                    <p>These concessions will be dangerous ones; but they will not necessarily be
                        catastrophic if we are thoroughly conscious of what we are doing, and if we
                        lay our general course toward the avoidance of the possibility of the
                        responsibility I have referred to. If we do not lay our course in that
                        direction but drift along the lines of least resistance in the existing
                        vortex of cross currents, our entire policy in the Middle Eastern area will
                        unquestionably be carried in the direction of confusion, ineffectiveness,
                        and grievous involvement in a situation to which there cannot be—from our
                        standpoint—any happy ending.</p>
                    <p>I think it should be stated that if this Government is carried to a point in
                        the Palestine controversy where it is required to send U.S. forces to
                        Palestine in any manner whatsoever, or to agree either to the international
                        recruitment of volunteers or the sending of small nation forces which would
                        include those of Soviet satellites, then in my opinion, the whole structure
                        of strategic and political planning which we have been building up for the
                        Mediterranean and Middle Eastern areas would have to be re-examined and
                        probably modified or replaced by something else. For this would then mean
                        that we had consented to be guided, in a highly important question affecting
                        those areas, not by national interest but by other considerations. If we
                        tried, in the face of this fact, to continue with policy in adjacent areas
                        motivated solely by national interest, we would be faced with a duality of
                        purpose which would surely lead in the end to a dissipation and confusion of
                        effort. We cannot operate with one objective in one area, and with a
                        conflicting one next door.</p>
                    <p>If, therefore, we decide that we are obliged by past commitments or <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> decision or any other consideration to take a
                        leading part in the enforcement in Palestine of any arrangement opposed by
                        the great majority of the inhabitants of the Middle Eastern area, we must be
                        prepared to face the implications of this act by revising our general policy
                        in that part of the world. And since the Middle East is vital to the present
                        security concepts on which this Government is basing itself in its worldwide
                        military and political planning, this would further mean a review of our
                        entire military and political policy.</p>

                    <p>If the Russians have further success in the coming months in their efforts at
                        penetration and seizure of political control of the key countries <pb

                        France, Italy, and Greece), they will continue, in my opinion, to be
                        impossible to deal with at the council table. For they will see no reason to
                        settle with us at this time over Germany when they hope that their
                        bargaining position will soon be improved.</p>
                    <p>If, on the other hand, their situation outside the iron curtain does not
                        improve—if the <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> aid arrives in time and
                        in a form to do some good and if there is a general revival of confidence in
                        western Europe, then a new situation will arise and the Russians will be
                        prepared, for the first time since the surrender, to do business seriously
                        with us about Germany and about Europe in general. They are conscious of
                        this and are making allowance for this possibility in their plans. I think,
                        in fact, that they regard it as the more probable of the two
                        contingencies.</p>
                    <p>When that day comes, i.e. when the Russians will be prepared to talk
                        realistically with us, we will be faced with a great test of American
                        statesmanship, and it will not be easy to find the right solution. For what
                        the Russians will want us to do will be to conclude with them a
                        sphere-of-influence agreement similar to the one they concluded with the
                        Germans in 1939. It will be our job to explain to them that we cannot do
                        this and why. But we must also be able to demonstrate to them that it will
                        still be worth their while: <list>

                        thresh out some common understanding of what would really be meant by any
                        further written agreements we might arrive at.</p>
                    <p>The Russians will probably not be prepared to “talk turkey” with us until
                        after the elections. But it would be much easier to talk to them at that
                        time if the discussions did not have to be inaugurated too abruptly and if
                        the ground had been prepared beforehand.</p>
                    <p>The Russians recently made an interesting approach to Murphy in Berlin,
                        obviously with a view to drawing us out and to testing our interest in
                        talking with them frankly and realistically on the informal plane. I do not
                        think Berlin a desirable place for the pursuit of further discussions of
                        this sort. On the other hand, I do not think that we should give them a
                        complete cold shoulder. We must always be careful not to give discouragement
                        to people in the Kremlin who may urge the desirability of better
                        understanding with us.</p>
                    <p>I think, in the light of the above, we should give careful attention to the
                        personnel arrangements which we make with relation to the Russian field in
                        the next few months, and that we should play our cards throughout with a
                        view to the possibility of arriving eventually at some sort of a background
                        understanding with the Kremlin. But we must bear in mind that this
                        understanding would necessarily have to be limited and coldly realistic,
                        could not be reduced to paper, and could not be expected to outlast the
                        general international situation which had given rise to it.</p>
                    <p>I may add that I think such an understanding would have to be restricted
                        pretty much to the European and western Mediterranean areas. I doubt that it
                        could be extended to apply to the Middle East and Far East. The situation in
                        these latter areas is too unsettled, the prospects for the future too
                        confusing, the possibilities of one sort or another too vast and
                        unforeseeable, to admit of such discussions. The only exception to this
                        might be with respect to Japan. It might Conceivably be possible for us to
                        achieve some arrangement whereby the economic exchanges between Japan and
                        Manchuria might be revived in a guarded and modified form, by some sort of
                        barter arrangement. This is an objective well worth holding in mind, from
                        our standpoint. But we should meanwhile have to frame our policies in Japan
                        with a view to creating better bargaining power for such discussions than we
                        now possess.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>My main impression with regard to the position of this Government with regard
                        to the Far East is that we are greatly over-extended <pb n="524"
                            xml:id="pg_524" facs="0034"/>in our whole thinking about what we can
                        accomplish, and should try to accomplish, in that area. This applies,
                        unfortunately, to the public in our country as well as to the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>It is urgently necessary that we recognize our own limitations as a moral and
                        ideological force among the Asiatic peoples.</p>
                    <p>Our political philosophy and our patterns for living have very little
                        applicability to masses of people in Asia. They may be all right for us,
                        with our highly developed political traditions running back into the
                        centuries and with our peculiarly favorable geographic position; but they
                        are simply not practical or helpful, today, for most of the people in
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>This being the case, we must be very careful when we speak of exercising
                        “leadership” in Asia. We are deceiving ourselves and others, when we pretend
                        to have the answers to the problems which agitate many of these Asiatic
                        peoples.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we have about 50% of the world’s wealth but only 6.3% of its
                        population. This disparity is particularly great as between ourselves and
                        the peoples of Asia. In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of
                        envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a
                        pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of
                        disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so, we
                        will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our
                        attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national
                        objectives. We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the
                        luxury of altruism and world-benefaction.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, we must observe great restraint in our attitude toward the
                        Far Eastern areas. The peoples of Asia and of the Pacific area are going to
                        go ahead, whatever we do, with the development of their political forms and
                        mutual interrelationships in their own way. This process cannot be a liberal
                        or peaceful one. The greatest of the Asiatic peoples—the Chinese and the
                        Indians—have not yet even made a beginning at the solution of the basic
                        demographic problem involved in the relationship between their food supply
                        and their birth rate. Until they find some solution to this problem, further
                        hunger, distress and violence are inevitable. All of the Asiatic peoples are
                        faced with the necessity for evolving new forms of life to conform to the
                        impact of modern technology. This process of adaptation will also be long
                        and violent. It is not only possible, but probable, that in the course of
                        this process many peoples will fall, for varying periods, under the
                        influence of Moscow, whose ideology has a greater lure for such peoples, and
                        probably greater reality, than anything we could oppose to it. All this,
                        too, is probably unavoidable; and we could not hope to combat it without the
                        diversion of a far greater portion of <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525"
                            facs="0035"/>our national effort than our people would ever willingly
                        concede to such a purpose.</p>
                    <p>In the face of this situation we would be better off to dispense now with a
                        number of the concepts which have underlined our thinking with regard to the
                        Far East. We should dispense with the aspiration to “be liked” or to be
                        regarded as the repository of a high-minded international altruism. We
                        should stop putting ourselves in the position, of being our brothers’ keeper
                        and refrain from offering moral and ideological advice. We should cease to
                        talk about vague and—for the Far East—unreal objectives such as human
                        rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization. The day is
                        not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts.
                        The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.</p>
                    <p>We should recognize that our influence in the Far Eastern area in the coming
                        period is going to be primarily military and economic. We should make a
                        careful study to see what parts of the Pacific and Far Eastern world are
                        absolutely vital to our security, and we should concentrate our policy on
                        seeing to it that those areas remain in hands which we can control or rely
                        on. It is my own guess, on the basis of such study as we have given the
                        problem so far, that Japan and the Philippines will be found to be the
                        corner-stones of such a Pacific security system and that if we can contrive
                        to retain effective control over these areas there can be no serious threat
                        to our security from the East within our time.</p>
                    <p>Only when we have assured this first objective, can we allow ourselves the
                        luxury of going farther afield in our thinking and our planning.</p>
                    <p>If these basic concepts are accepted, then our objectives for the immediate
                        coming period should be: <list>

                            <item>to devise policies with respect to Japan which assure the security
                                of those islands from communist penetration and domination as well
                                as from Soviet military attack, and which will permit the economic
                                potential of that country to become again an important force in the
                                Far East, responsive to the interests of peace and stability in the
                                Pacific area; and</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                            <item>to shape our relationship to the Philippines in such a way as to
                                permit to the Philippine Government a continued independence in all
                                internal affairs but to preserve the archipelago as a bulwark of
                                U.S. security in that area.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Of these three objectives, the one relating to Japan is the one where there
                        is the greatest need for immediate attention on the part of our Government
                        and the greatest possibility for immediate action. It <pb n="526"
                            xml:id="pg_526" facs="0036"/>should therefore be made the focal point of
                        our policy for the Far East in the coming period.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>A broad conflict runs through U.S. policy today between what may be called
                        the universalistic and the particularized approaches to the solution of
                        international problems.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">universalistic</hi> approach looks to the solution of
                        international problems by providing a universalistic pattern of rules and
                        procedures which would be applicable to all countries, or at least all
                        countries prepared to join, in an identical way. This approach has the
                        tendency to rule out <hi rend="italic">political</hi> solutions (that is,
                        solutions related to the peculiarities in the positions and attitudes of the
                        individual peoples). It favors legalistic and mechanical solutions,
                        applicable to all countries alike. It has already been embodied in the
                        United Nations, in the proposed <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter,
                        in <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>, in the <gloss
                            target="#t_PICAO1">PICAO</gloss>, and in similar efforts at universal
                        world collaboration in given spheres of foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>This universalistic approach has a strong appeal to U.S. public opinion; for
                        it appears to obviate the necessity of dealing with the national
                        peculiarities and diverging political philosophies of foreign peoples; which
                        many of our people find confusing and irritating. In this sense, it contains
                        a strong vein of escapism. To the extent that it could be made to apply, it
                        would relieve us of the necessity of dealing with the world as it is. It
                        assumes that if all countries could be induced to subscribe to certain
                        standard rules of behavior, the ugly realities—the power aspirations, the
                        national prejudices, the irrational hatreds and jealousies—would be forced
                        to recede behind the protecting curtain of accepted legal restraint, and
                        that the problems of our foreign policy could thus be reduced to the
                        familiar terms of parliamentary procedure and majority decision. The outward
                        form established for international dealings would then cover and conceal the
                        inner content. And instead of being compelled to make the sordid and
                        involved political choices inherent in traditional diplomacy, we could make
                        decisions on the lofty but simple plane of moral principle and under the
                        protecting cover of majority decision.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">particularized</hi> approach is one which is skeptical
                        of any scheme for compressing international affairs into legalistic
                        concepts. It holds that the content is more important than the form, and
                        will force its way through any formal structure which is placed upon it. It
                        considers that the thirst for power is still dominant among so many peoples
                        that it cannot be assuaged or controlled by anything but counter-force. It
                        does not reject entirely the idea of alliance as a suitable <pb n="527"
                            xml:id="pg_527" facs="0037"/>form of counter-force; but it considers
                        that if alliance is to be effective it must be based upon real community of
                        interest and outlook, which is to be found only among limited groups of
                        governments, and not upon the abstract formalism of universal international
                        law or international organization. It places no credence in the readiness of
                        most peoples to wage war or to make national sacrifices in the interests of
                        an abstraction called “peace”. On the contrary, it sees in universal
                        undertakings a series of obligations which might, in view of the
                        shortsightedness and timidity of other governments, prevent this country
                        from taking vigorous and incisive measures for its own defense and for the
                        defense of concepts of international relations which might be of vital
                        importance to world stability as a whole. It sees effective and determined
                        U.S. policy being caught, at decisive moments, in the meshes of a sterile
                        and cumbersome international parliamentarianism, if the universalistic
                        concepts are applied.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the particularized approach to foreign policy problems distrusts the
                        theory of national sovereignty as it expresses itself today in international
                        organization. The modern techniques of aggressive expansion lend themselves
                        too well to the pouring of new wine into old vessels—to the infusion of a
                        foreign political will into the personality of an ostensibly independent
                        nation. In these circumstances, the parliamentary principle in world affairs
                        can easily become distorted and abused as it has been in the case of White
                        Russia, the Ukraine and the Russian satellites. This is not to mention the
                        problem of the distinction between large and small states, and the voice
                        that they should have, respectively, in world affairs.</p>
                    <p>This Government is now conducting a dual policy, which combines elements of
                        both of these approaches. This finds its reflection in the Department of
                        State, where the functional (or universalistic) concept vies with the
                        geographic (or particularized) in the framing and conduct of policy, as well
                        as in the principles of Departmental organization.</p>
                    <p>This duality is something to which we are now deeply committed. I do not mean
                        to recommend that we should make any sudden changes. We cannot today
                        abruptly renounce aspirations which have become for many people here and
                        abroad a symbol of our belief in the possibility of a peaceful world.</p>
                    <p>But it is my own belief that in our pursuance of a workable world order we
                        have started from the wrong end. Instead of beginning at the center, which
                        is our own immediate neighborhood—the area of our own political and economic
                        tradition—and working outward, we have started on the periphery of the
                        entire circle, i.e., on the universalistic principle of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and have attempted to work inward. This has
                            <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0038"/>meant a great dispersal of our
                        effort, and has brought perilously close to discredit those very concepts of
                        a universal world order to which we were so attached. If we wish to preserve
                        those concepts for the future we must hasten to remove some of the strain we
                        have placed upon them and to build a solid structure, proceeding from a
                        central foundation, which can be thrust up to meet them before they collapse
                        of their own weight.</p>
                    <p>This is the significance of the <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss>, the idea
                        of European union, and the cultivation of a closer association with the U.K.
                        and Canada. For a truly stable world order can proceed, within our lifetime,
                        only from the older, mellower and more advanced nations of the world—nations
                        for which the concept of order, as opposed to power, has value and meaning.
                        If these nations do not have the strength to seize and hold real leadership
                        in world affairs today, through that combination of political greatness and
                        wise restraint which goes only with a ripe and settled civilization, then,
                        as Plato once remarked: “… cities will never have rest from their evils,—no,
                        nor the human race, as I believe.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>An attempt to survey the whole panorama of U.S. policy and to sketch the
                        lines of direction along which this country is moving in its relations with
                        the rest of the world yields little cause for complacency.</p>
                    <p>We are still faced with an extremely serious threat to our whole security, in
                        the form of the men in the Kremlin. These men are an able, shrewd and
                        utterly ruthless group, absolutely devoid of respect for us or our
                        institutions. They wish for nothing more than the destruction of our
                        national strength. They operate through a political organization of
                        unparalleled flexibility, discipline, cynicism and toughness. They command
                        the resources of one of the world’s greatest industrial and agricultural
                        nations. Natural force, independent of our policies, may go far to absorb
                        and eventually defeat the efforts of this group. But we cannot depend upon
                        this. Our own diplomacy has a decisive part to play in this connection. The
                        problems involved are new to us, and we are only beginning to adjust
                        ourselves to them. We have made some progress; but we are not yet nearly far
                        enough advanced. Our operations in foreign affairs must attain a far higher
                        degree of purposefulness, of economy of effort, and of disciplined
                        coordination if we are to be sure of accomplishing our purposes.</p>
                    <p>In the western European area communism has suffered a momentary check; but
                        the issue is still in the balance. This Government has as yet evolved no
                        firm plans for helping Britain meet her basic long-term economic problem, or
                        for fitting Germany into western Europe in a <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529"
                            facs="0039"/>way that gives permanence of assuring the continued,
                        independence and prosperity of the other nations of western Europe.</p>
                    <p>In the Mediterranean and Middle East, we have a situation where a vigorous
                        and collective national effort, utilizing both our political and military
                        resources, could probably prevent the area from falling under Soviet
                        influence and preserve it as a highly important factor in our world
                        strategic position. But we are deeply involved, in that same area, in a
                        situation which has no direct relation to our national security, and where
                        the motives of our involvement lie solely in past commitments of dubious
                        wisdom and in our attachment to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        itself. If we do not effect a fairly radical reversal of the trend of our
                        policy to date, we will end up either in the position of being ourselves
                        militarily responsible for the protection of the Jewish population in
                        Palestine against the declared hostility of the Arab world, or of sharing
                        that responsibility with the Russians and thus assisting at their
                        installation as one of the military powers of the area. In either case, the
                        clarity and efficiency of a sound national policy for that area will be
                        shattered.</p>
                    <p>In the Far East, our position is not bad; and we still have a reasonably firm
                        grip on most of what is strategically essential to us. But our present
                        controls are temporary ones which cannot long endure, and we have not yet
                        worked out realistic plans for replacing them with a permanent structure.
                        Meanwhile, our own public has been grievously misled by the sentimentalists
                        on the significance of the area to ourselves; and we are only beginning with
                        the long and contentious process of re-education which will be necessary
                        before a realistic Far Eastern policy can receive the popular understanding
                        it deserves.</p>
                    <p>In all areas of the world, we still find ourselves the victims of many of the
                        romantic and universalistic concepts with which we emerged from the recent
                        war. The initial build-up of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in U.S.
                        public opinion was so tremendous that it is possibly true, as is frequently
                        alleged, that we have no choice but to make it the cornerstone of our policy
                        in this post-hostilities period. Occasionally, it has served a useful
                        purpose. But by and large it has created more problems than it has solved,
                        and has led to a considerable dispersal of our diplomatic effort. And in’
                        our efforts to use the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> majority for major
                        political purposes we are playing with a dangerous weapon which may some day
                        turn against us. This is a situation which warrants most careful study and
                        foresight on our part.</p>

                            <item>The best information available to the Planning Staff is that the

                        structure, and our forces are encumbered with a large body of dependents,

                        and that we have a serious responsibility to the natives of the islands,
                        whose lives were terribly shattered by the war and who look to us with

                        themselves frustrated at every turn by the complete uncertainty surrounding
                        the political future. Meanwhile neither our presence on the islands nor our

                    <p>The first of these points needs no elaboration. I believe that it coincides
                        with strategic thinking both in Washington and in Tokyo.</p>
                    <p>As for the second, I know that this coincides with the thinking of General
                            MacArthur,<note n="7" xml:id="d6fn7">General of the Army Douglas
                            MacArthur, Commanding General, United States Army Forces in the Pacific;
                            Supreme Commander, Allied Powers in Japan.</note> and I think it would
                        have substantially unanimous concurrence of the other senior officers in
                        this area.</p>
                    <p>As for point 3: again I can say that this meets General MacArthur’s views, as
                        far as Japan is concerned. He points out that we cannot expect to maintain
                        strategic facilities in Japan in the post-treaty period unless we wish to
                        open the road to similar demands by others of the Allies. This applies, in
                        his opinion, not only to the Russians: the Chinese and Australians would
                        probably both want bases in Japan if we were to have them. General MacArthur
                        does not consider bases on Japanese territory essential to our defense, as
                        long as Japan itself remains demilitarized and neutralized. I consider that
                        this solution is by far the simplest and most practical from the political
                        standpoint.</p>
                    <p>As for the Philippines, things are not so simple; and I am sure we will
                        encounter a wide variety of views with respect to this proposal. There does
                        seem, however, to be a pretty unanimous feeling here that we must either do
                        one thing or another with regard to the Philippines: i.e., either we must go
                        in with all four feet on a full-fledged program of military assistance and
                        base development, designed to provide the <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535"
                            facs="0045"/>Philippines with a genuine sense of security in the face of
                        the prospect of future invasion, or we must remove our bases entirely from
                        the islands and reduce our military assistance program to something which
                        would be realistic in the light of local conditions. I personally feel that
                        the latter course would be preferable because of the limitations cited above
                        on any large-scale U.S. overseas action in peace time, and because I fail to
                        see what possible motive any potential military opponent of our country
                        could have for invading the Philippines today if we ourselves did not have
                        any military facilities on the islands. I believe that both General Jones,
                        Chief of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group, and General Moore,
                        Commanding General of the Philippines–Ryukyus Command, would have some
                        sympathy for this view, although they might not put it just the way I have.
                        Here too, of course, as in the case of Japan, the absence of U.S. bases on
                        the islands would be conditional on the assumption that no other power had
                        military facilities here or showed any intention of seeking any.</p>
                    <p>The Navy will feel, I am sure, that its needs would not be adequately met by
                        this concept. It will argue that this precludes it from obtaining
                        permanently the facilities it is now enjoying at Yokosuka, in Tokyo Bay, and
                        that there is no other suitable base in the area I am discussing. It rejects
                        the idea of installing itself at Okinawa, remembering the 180 vessels which
                        it lost there in the 1945 typhoon.</p>
                    <p>I have much sympathy for the Navy’s feelings in this matter. Eventually, I
                        suppose, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will have to evaluate its
                        needs from the straight military standpoint. I should be surprised, however,
                        if these needs were to prove great enough to over-ride all the other
                        considerations, political and otherwise, which argue for the concept I have
                        advanced.</p>
                    <p>If not, then the role of the Navy under this concept, would be as follows: <list>

                        our policy should be directed towards the earliest possible withdrawal, with
                        the smallest possible loss of prestige.</p>

                    <p>Our first task with regard to Okinawa and the Ryukyus is to terminate the
                        uncertainty surrounding their future. I believe that we should make up our
                        minds right now (preferably in the form of a National Security Council
                        paper) that we intend to hold on to Okinawa and to such other strategic
                        facilities as we require in the archipelago, south of the 29th parallel as
                        long as the present international situation endures. The question of how to
                        make this decision public would then be one of technique, on which Dean
                            Rusk<note n="10" xml:id="d6fn10">Dean Rusk, Director of the Office of
                            United Nations Affairs.</note> might have some views. Presumably, the
                        question should first be aired and cleared in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>; but we should accept no solution short of a trusteeship for
                        the islands as a whole and a strategic trusteeship for such of them as we
                        require for our military purposes. If this cannot be obtained in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> we should not hesitate to make a public
                        announcement to the effect that the circumstances of the war have left us
                        with the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> custody of the Ryukyu people; that
                        they are incapable of looking after their own protection; that in the
                        absence of international agreement as to their future security it would be
                        an act of irresponsibility to leave them defenseless; that on the other hand
                        we cannot proceed with an orderly and progressive rehabilitation and
                        development of life in the islands unless there can be some certainty about
                        the future and unless we can lay plans for some time in advance; and that we
                        have therefore decided that the present status will be continued for a
                        minimum of ten years and as long thereafter as world conditions may
                        necessitate. Having done that, we should then make permanent arrangements
                        for the handling of civilian affairs on the islands and proceed with a
                        vigorous program of base development and of economic rehabilitation. The
                        Okinawans themselves, who constitute the bulk of the population, would be
                        only too pleased with this solution.</p>
                    <p>It would be further possible, and I think desirable, for us to recruit and
                        train an Okinawan auxiliary force, along the lines of the Philippine <pb

                        duty, etc., on the islands. This should reduce the logistical burden on our
                        own forces stationed there.</p>
                    <p>The Army planners are thinking about a scheme, I believe, under which our
                        units would not be permanently stationed at Okinawa but would be rotated
                        fairly frequently; and no dependents would be permitted. I think this would
                        be highly desirable.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">4. <hi rend="italic">The Philippines</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The implementation of this program with respect to the Philippines would
                        undoubtedly raise delicate political questions on which I am reluctant to
                        comment, in view of my own unfamiliarity with the subject. It is my
                        understanding, however, that the Filipinos are torn on their own thinking on
                        this subject, and that some of them are now toying with the idea that a
                        Philippine Republic having no foreign bases or forces on its territory and
                        relying formally on the United Nations for its security might be no less
                        secure than one which is partially, but inadequately, garrisoned by a great
                        military power, for reasons which must always remain here an object of
                        conjecture and suspicion. I may be wrong on this; but I think that much
                        could be accomplished in bringing them around to our way of thinking if we
                        were first to make up our own minds and if then someone with full authority
                        to speak for our Government in these matters were to talk the matter out
                        with Roxas<note n="11" xml:id="d6fn11">Manuel Roxas, President of the
                            Republic of the Philippines.</note> and explain to him something of our
                        thinking as well as some of the strategic facts governing their own
                        position. In any case, by offering to withdraw our bases we would force the
                        Filipinos to ask specifically for their retention if they still wanted them.
                        This would enable us to name our terms and would place responsibility
                        squarely on the Philippine Government for retention of the facilities in
                        whatever form we might arrange.</p>
                    <p>In my view, any military withdrawal from the Philippines should be
                        accompanied by a continuation, and even accentuation, of all our
                        non-military activities here, and with loyal and generous assistance to the
                        Philippine Government in any training programs of a semi-military nature,
                        such as constabulary or guerrilla organization, which might be feasible. We
                        are seriously committed by our past statements to aid these people where we
                        can. I am persuaded that it is useless for them to try to maintain—and
                        therefore useless for us to help them to maintain—a regular modern armed
                        force. The standards of public health throughout the country are still not
                        adequate to the maintenance of effective reserve strength. And the finances
                        will not permit, within the foreseeable future, the maintenance of a
                        standing force on a scale that could play any serious part in the <hi
                            rend="italic">prevention</hi> of invasion against major attack.
                        Guerrilla forces are another matter. These require <pb n="538"
                            xml:id="pg_538" facs="0048"/>no higher central organization and no
                        elaborate technical equipment or training. They lie close to the instincts
                        of the people and to the geographic character of the country. They could
                        play a serious part in frustating the long-term objectives of a possible
                        invader.</p>
                    <p>The above is only a rough outline, and would stand a lot of polishing.</p>
                    <p>I have talked mostly about military matters; but my interest in this concept
                        stems directly from the fact that it would provide us with the basis of a
                        political program for this area. If we knew that these proposals, or
                        something like them, constituted our long-term strategic concept, we would
                        have firm points of orientation for our short-term policies in this area. We
                        could then approach the immediate questions of the Jap peace treaty, the
                        Ryukyus, and our base difficulties in the Philippines, in a confident and
                        consistent manner; and I think we could avoid most of the pitfalls which now
                        seem to me to loom across our path. But without some such concept, we cannot
                        move at all. In drafting my own recommendations on Japan, I was obliged to
                        assume <hi rend="italic">some</hi> over-all concept; and the one I assumed
                        was the one outlined above.</p>
                    <p>I need hardly stress the desirability of an early clarification of our policy
                        in this area in view of the trend of world events and the necessity of
                        having all our hatches battened down for the coming period.</p>
                    <p>I except to be home about March 24. Presumably, we will then be able to
                        proceed to the working out of a firm government position on these questions.
                        Meanwhile, I hope the considerations set forth above may be of some interest
                        and value to you.</p>

                        sums. Once the world was convinced of that fact, it would then be possible
                        to begin the re-establishment of some kind of political balance and
                        stability throughout the world.” (Walter Millis (ed.), <hi rend="italic">The

                        the Far East “would have to be abandoned to chaos and Communism.” (<hi

                                such missions might well be of prolonged duration, it is possible
                                that a large portion or all of the strategic reserve would be

                        Services Committee on Thursday.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">On Thursday, March
                            25, Forrestal, supported by the Service Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff, presented the administration’s program for Universal Military
                            Training and Selective Service to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
                            The Secretary of Defense called for an increase of authorized strength
                            of the armed forces by approximately 350,000 men, the drafting of
                            220,000 men for two years service, “universal military training” for
                            about 850,000 18 and 19 year olds for one year, and the appropriation of
                            an additional $3 billion for defense. For text of his statement, see

                        of a stark comparison of this nature between the forces disposed of by the
                        Soviet Union and those of the free world. I am not questioning the accuracy,
                        although I assume the figures on the Soviet Union are at best nothing but
                        guesses. The political effect of this comparison would be very serious in
                        Europe, especially the statement as to <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542"
                            facs="0052"/>the number of weeks it would take for Russia to reach the
                        Atlantic and the Pyrenees. In France, particularly, such a statement would
                        be very disheartening. It would, I am afraid, undo much of the good abroad
                        of the President’s address.</p>
                    <p>While we cannot afford to bluff in this matter, the struggle is still in its
                        political phase and anything which tends to reduce the will to resist in the
                        Western democracies is a loss to us and a gain to the Soviets. The picture
                        which this presents is one of such hopelessness from a military point of
                        view that it will not only dishearten free Europe, but will have a direct
                        effect on <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss>. There is no note of
                        confidence in the ability of free Europe backed by us to give pause to the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we are not at all certain that the Russians are convinced that
                        the military advantage lies so heavily on their side. They sometimes have a
                        tendency to be caught in their own propaganda which, as you know, is to the
                        effect that imperialist America is rushing around to take over the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>I have the further reaction that the statement is drafted in such a form that
                        it is more a preliminary to war than a proposal for preparation to avoid
                        war.</p>

                    <p>It is difficult to define Soviet aggression in terms of our old international
                        conceptions. It does not involve the marching of hostile troops across a
                        boundary line. The aggression is primarily against individual rights and
                        freedoms and the use of terror to stifle opposition.</p>
                    <p>Today there is hardly anyone in Europe or Asia who does not feel that if he
                        asserts himself in a manner displeasing to the Soviet Communist Party, he
                        will be, or shortly may be, liquidated. That terror is having a tremendous
                        effect upon the willingness of people to oppose Soviet penetration and upon
                        their ability to plan and work creatively. That is not a tolerable state of
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations was designed to prevent such a condition. The Preamble to
                        the Charter expresses the faith of the peoples of the United Nations in
                        fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person
                        and their determination to practice tolerance. The United Nations was
                        designed to develop such ideals into international law and to establish a
                        police force to protect them. It was recognized that to do this on a
                        universal basis would be slow, but it was assumed that victory in World War
                        II would provide a period of time in which to develop protection against
                        another World War before such a war would be a substantial risk. Now it
                        seems that that assumption was unfounded. It may, therefore, be necessary in
                        the first instance to establish law and order on a less than universal basis
                        for fear is spreading and the ideals of the United Nations already are being
                        undermined.</p>
                    <p>The Charter does not prevent progress on a less than universal basis. It
                        expressly recognizes the inherent right of individual or collective
                        self-defense. We believe that those nations which can agree on what are
                        human rights and fundamental freedoms and who can agree on what constitutes
                        an attack upon those rights and freedoms, should at once do so. Also, we
                        believe that they should establish a joint force to protect those who would
                        exercise those rights. It would be purely defensive and not aggressive
                        against any nation. It would stop the growing reign of terror and would
                        liberate effort for what is creative.</p>

                    <p>1. To assess and appraise the position of the United States with respect to
                        Soviet-directed world communism, taking into account the security interests
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="center">

                    </p>
                    <p>2. The ultimate objective of Soviet-directed world communism is the
                        domination of the world. To this end, Soviet-directed world communism
                        employs against its victims in opportunistic coordination the complementary
                        instruments of Soviet aggressive pressure from without and militant
                        revolutionary subversion from within. Both instruments are supported by the
                        formidable material power of the USSR and their use is facilitated by the
                        chaotic aftermath of the war.</p>
                    <p>3. The defeat of the Axis left the world with only two great centers of
                        national power, the United States and the USSR. The Soviet Union is the
                        source of power from which international communism chiefly derives its
                        capability to threaten the existence of free nations. The United States is
                        the only source of power capable of mobilizing successful opposition to the
                        communist goal of world conquest. Between the United States and the USSR
                        there are in Europe and Asia areas of great potential power which if added
                        to the existing strength of the Soviet world would enable the latter to
                        become so superior in manpower, resources and territory that the prospect
                        for the survival of the United States as a free nation would be slight. In
                        these circumstances the USSR has engaged the United States in a struggle for
                        power, or “cold war”, in which our national security is at stake and from
                        which we cannot withdraw short of eventual national suicide.</p>
                    <p>4. Already Soviet-directed world communism has achieved alarming success in
                        its drive toward world conquest. It has established satellite police states
                        in Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumania, and
                        Czechoslovakia; it poses an immediate threat to Italy, Greece, Finland,
                        Korea, the Scandanavian countries, and others. The USSR has prevented the
                        conclusion of peace treaties with Germany, Austria,<note n="4"

                        control of atomic energy and the effective functioning of the United
                        Nations. Today Stalin has come close to achieving what Hitler attempted in
                        vain. The Soviet world extends from the Elbe River and <pb n="547"
                            xml:id="pg_547" facs="0057"/>the Adriatic Sea on the west to Manchuria
                        on the east, and embraces one-fifth of the land surface of the world.</p>
                    <p>5. In addition, Soviet-directed world communism has faced the non-Soviet
                        world with something new in history. This is the worldwide Fifth Column
                        directed at frustrating foreign policy, dividing and confusing the people of
                        a country, planting the seeds of disruption in time of war, and subverting
                        the freedom of democratic states. Under a multitude of disguises, it is
                        capable of fomenting disorders, including armed conflicts, within its
                        victim’s territory without involving the direct responsibility of any
                        communist state. The democracies have been deterred in effectively meeting
                        this threat, in part because communism has been allowed to operate as a
                        legitimate political activity under the protection of civil liberties.</p>
                    <p>6. In its relations with other nations the USSR is guided by the communist
                        dogma that the peaceful co-existence of communist and capitalist states is
                        in the long run impossible. On the basis of this postulate of ultimate
                        inevitable conflict, the USSR is attempting to gain world domination by
                        subversion, and by legal and illegal political and economic measures, but
                        might ultimately resort to war if necessary to gain its ends. Such a war
                        might be waged openly by the USSR with her satellites, or might be waged by
                        one or a combination of the satellites with the avowed neutrality or
                        disapproval of the USSR, though with her covert support. However, the Soviet
                        Union so far has sought to avoid overt conflict, since time is required to
                        build up its strength and concurrently to weaken and divide its opponents.
                        In such a postponement, time is on the side of the Soviet Union so long as
                        it can continue to increase its relative power by the present process of
                        indirect aggression and internal subversion.</p>
                    <p>7. In view of the nature of Soviet-directed world communism, the successes
                        which it has already achieved, and the threat of further advances in the
                        immediate future, a defensive policy cannot be considered an effectual means
                        of checking the momentum of communist expansion and inducing the Kremlin to
                        relinquish its aggressive designs. A defensive policy by attempting to be
                        strong everywhere runs the risk of being weak everywhere. It leaves the
                        initiative to the Kremlin, enabling it to strike at the time and place most
                        suitable to its purpose and to effect tactical withdrawals and diversions.
                        It permits the Kremlin to hold what it has already gained and leaves its
                        power potential intact.</p>
                    <p>8. As an alternative to a defensive policy the United States has open to it
                        the organization of a world-wide counter-offensive against Soviet-directed
                        world communism. Such a policy would involve first of all strengthening the
                        military potential of the United States, and secondly, mobilizing and
                        strengthening the potential of the non-Soviet <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548"
                            facs="0058"/>world. A counter-offensive policy would gain the initiative
                        and permit concentration of strength on vital objectives. It would
                        strengthen the will to resist of anti-communist forces throughout the world
                        and furnish convincing evidence of US determination to thwart the communist
                        design of world conquest. It should enlist the support of the American
                        people and of the peoples of the non-Soviet world. It would be consistent
                        with the national objectives of the United States. This policy, in fact,
                        would be the most effective way of deterring the USSR from further
                        aggression. Such aggression might ultimately require the United States, in
                        order to sustain itself, to mobilize all of its resources against the
                        continued threat of war, resulting in the creation of a vast armed camp
                        within its borders. In the latter eventuality, rigid economies,
                        regimentation and a fear psychosis might easily promote the very conditions
                        in the United States that we are determined to eliminate elsewhere in the
                        world. The measures adopted under a counter-offensive policy need not be
                        inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We
                        would continue to support the United Nations within the limits of its
                        capabilities, and seek to strengthen it.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>9. The defeat of the forces of Soviet-directed world communism is vital to
                        the security of the United States.</p>
                    <p>10. This objective cannot be achieved by a defensive policy.</p>
                    <p>11. The United States should therefore take the lead in organizing a
                        world-wide counter-offensive aimed at mobilizing and strengthening our own
                        and anti-communist forces in the non-Soviet world, and at undermining the
                        strength of the communist forces in the Soviet world.</p>
                    <p>12. As immediate steps in the counter-offensive, the United States should
                        take the following measures: <list>

                        “Soviet Intentions” which has been, prepared by the Joint Intelligence
                        Committee with the assistance of specialists in the various sections of the
                        Embassy, including consultation with the Military, Naval and Air Attachés,
                        who concur in its findings.</p>
                    <p>As will be noted, the question which the Committee set out to answer was
                        whether, from the Kremlin’s point of view and taking into consideration all
                        the factors affecting the present international situation, the Soviet Union
                        would resort to military action in the immediate future in support of its
                        objectives of Communist expansion. The conclusions of the report attempt not
                        only to answer this Question, but also to stipulate those conditions under
                        which the Soviet Government might undertake military action and those under
                        which it might defer such action to pursue another course.</p>
                    <p>It is recognized that the data available to the Embassy are limited and that
                        in Washington it may be possible to supplement the material which is
                        presented here, particularly with regard to those political, economic and
                        military resources outside the Soviet Union which would be available to it
                        for the furtherance of its objectives.<note n="1" xml:id="d13fn1">The views

                    <p>The Red Army and Soviet air forces are capable of taking continental Europe
                        and key areas of Asia within a few months. It is improbable that the British
                        Isles could be subjected to air attacks to the extent that their use as
                        bases by the United States and British air forces would be impossible.
                        Occupation of Europe would make Mediterranean Sea routes difficult, but it
                        is improbable that the use of air bases in northern Africa would be denied
                        thereby to the United States and its allies.</p>
                    <p>Soviet forces could hold European territory for at least two years before the
                        United States and her allies could assemble and supply a force sufficiently
                        strong to attempt a continental invasion. At least during the early months
                        of this period, in spite of long ranged Western air attacks, the Soviet
                        Union would be able to improve its air defenses in preparation for the
                        greatly increased air attacks that would be expected later. In the race for
                        air supremacy which would occur during this period, the U.S.S.R. would
                        profit by the acquisition of factories and skilled workmen in Europe, but
                        the resources, experience, ability and capacity of the United States in
                        production of aircraft would be expected to outdistance the accomplishments
                        of the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>The atomic bomb is a factor which would of course be given due consideration
                        in any decision by the Kremlin to initiate military action. Its
                        effectiveness, however, depends upon the ability of the United States to use
                        the bomb against cities and industrial areas of the Soviet Union to disrupt
                        or paralyze its war effort. At present the United States has only limited
                        means for employing the atomic bomb against the U.S.S.R. and it is possible
                        that in addition to its natural geographic ^advantages, the Soviet Union may
                        develop defensive measures that would minimize the effect of the atomic
                        bomb. Other weapons of mass destruction are similar to the atomic bomb in
                        that their use is limited by other capabilities. Development of long-ra[n]ge
                        rocket missiles is still in an elementary stage. The Soviet Union may
                        possess the atomic bomb within the next three to four years and can possibly
                        develop and produce currently a means for its delivery, but the United
                        States will retain its initial superiority in this respect for a number of
                        years.</p>
                    <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0063"/>
                    <p>While from a military viewpoint the Soviet Union could immediately secure
                        control of Europe, it would be in a better position to maintain permanently
                        such control given a further period of peacetime development of war
                        potential. Inability of the Soviet Union to defeat the United States within
                        a period of a few years and to prevent widespread devastation of Soviet
                        territory would jeopardize the life of the Communist regime.</p>
                    <p>The factors affecting the eventual outcome of a war of world scale between
                        the United States and the USSR are not susceptible of exact analysis. The
                        acceptance by the United States of European domination by the Soviet Union
                        would be a victory for the latter and enable the “cold” war of Communism vs.
                        Capitalism to be continued. To defeat the Soviet Union it would undoubtedly
                        be necessary for the United States to launch and support overseas operations
                        of enormous magnitude and would require that American superiority in
                        mobility and production be fully and completely exploited. The overwhelming
                        strength of the United States Navy would enable the United States to seize
                        and exploit the initiative at the most opportune time. Such an effort
                        however would be on a gigantic scale, and would require such an enormous
                        expenditure of men and materiel and would have to be continued for such a
                        long period of time that it might become unpopular in the mind of the United
                        States citizens, who might bring about a change of government policy. In any
                        case, it would appear, at the present time, as though the eventual outcome
                        of a long war would he a gamble and therefore to be undertaken by the
                        Kremlin only as a last resort.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The economy of the Soviet Union has reached a stage where it is capable of
                        supporting a military operation by the Red Army involving the occupation of
                        Europe and key areas of Asia. While its productive capacity may be somewhat
                        below that of 1940, it is certainly greater than in the years of 1942 to
                        1943, even taking into account Lend-Lease deliveries. A decided advantage is
                        the state control and ownership of all industry which permits the
                        development of a thorough-going war economy even while technically at peace,
                        thus avoiding the difficulties attendant on the conversion from peace to war
                        production in free capitalist systems.</p>
                    <p>The occupation of Europe would substantially improve the economic potential
                        of the Soviet Union by providing additional productive capacity and force of
                        skilled and semi-skilled labor, as well as indigenous resources. However,
                        even then the economic potential of the United States would be far superior
                        to that of the Soviet Union. This factor would to some extent be offset by
                        the capacity of Soviet <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0064"/>forces to
                        operate with less materiel than required by military forces of Western
                        powers and by the extremely low standards of living which would be imposed
                        on occupied territories as well as in the Soviet Union itself, thereby
                        reducing consumer production to an irreducible minimum. In a long war of
                        attrition, the Soviet leaders would undoubtedly feel that mineral resources
                        would play an important part. During World War II, the United States with
                        its tremendous productive capacity, drew on its mineral resources to an
                        alarming extent, reducing its petroleum reserves, for example, to an
                        estimated twenty years reserve at the peacetime rate. In the Soviet Union,
                        the consumption of mineral resources is limited both by production
                        capabilities and lack of exploitation. Military effort would be expended by
                        the Soviet Union in denying to the United States foreign mineral resources,
                        particularly oil.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, support of a long war by the Soviet economy is contingent upon its
                        ability to operate without effective war damage either to its industries or
                        to its distribution system. The tremendous distances and dispersion of
                        Soviet industry make it relatively invulnerable to war damage. On the other
                        hand, the importance of transportation facilities are correspondingly
                        magnified thus tending to offset its invulnerability. Furthermore, in
                        long-range aerial warfare the technical superiority of the United States
                        should grow progressively greater.</p>
                    <p>While, in general, considerations indicate that the Soviet Union is prepared
                        economically for war, nevertheless, a few more years of peace would enable
                        the Soviet Union to make additional gains which would be highly desirable.
                        Restoration of industry and transport in western Russia could be completed.
                        Time would provide opportunity for the exploitation of the economics of
                        satellite states as well as those of the former Baltic republics. At the
                        same time, the program for the development of the Urals and Siberian areas,
                        started before World War II, would be carried on under the current five-year
                        plans.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Morale</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The nature of the Soviet regime is such that it can implement by propaganda
                        any policy which may be decided upon whether aggressive or defensive, and
                        whether calling for peace or war. Therefore the Soviet propaganda machine
                        could effectively support a war whether it occurred now or in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the Soviet leaders would give careful attention to the
                        status of morale at any time when military action might be initiated. War
                        now would be unpopular with the Russian people. Not having yet recovered
                        from the gigantic losses of the past war, the people look forward with hope
                        to a generally better life. It is recognized, <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555"
                            facs="0065"/>however, that immediate victories would stimulate the
                        inherent qualities of patriotism and so long as the war progressed
                        successfully it might be expected to receive popular support. However, if
                        hostilities were prolonged and if signs developed that the Soviet Union was
                        losing its favorable position and that prospect of victory was distant, a
                        serious break in morale might occur. At such time those minority nationalist
                        groups in the population which are controlled successfully in normal times
                        by totalitarian methods might become active and threaten the stability of
                        the regime. While morale would not be a decisive factor in timing the risk
                        of war, the Kremlin leaders might expect that a few more years would improve
                        the economic well-being of the population and thereby toughen morale. This
                        would not be true, however, if, because of increased strength and obvious
                        intent of the west to be ready for war, the Soviet authorities have to
                        divert more and more of their economic effort to building up war potential
                        in contrast to consumer goods production.</p>

                    <p>Communist control of eastern Europe is being consolidated and the economic
                        strength and reliability of the Soviet orbit countries may be expected to
                        improve with time. April elections in Italy may result in sufficient
                        Communist parliamentary strength to guarantee a Communist government within
                        the present year.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">The elections held in Italy on
                            April 18, 1948, resulted in a notable victory for the Christian
                            Democratic Party in both houses of the Legislature.</note> Communist
                        control of Italy would provide impetus to the French Communist party, which
                        might then conceivably win control of the government within a relatively
                        short period. With Communist control of France and Italy established,
                        Communist influence might be expected to increase rapidly in other Western
                        European countries and avenues opened up for extension of Communist
                        activities in the colonial world from Dakar to Saigon. Western Germany would
                        become an untenable island in a Communist sea.</p>
                    <p>Tactics of organized strikes and disorders carried out by Communist Parties
                        might be expected successfully to sabotage and negate the effect of the
                        Marshall Plan.</p>
                    <p>In other areas of the world there would be no reason to change present
                        methods of extending Communist influence. Communist control of Manchuria and
                        significant parts of China is practically assured with the Soviet position
                        in North Korea secure enough to permit extension of control to South Korea
                        whenever American forces are withdrawn. Communist influence in Africa, the
                        Near and Middle East can be successfully extended through Palestine, restive
                        minority groups and Italian and French colonies.</p>
                    <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0066"/>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is undoubtedly convinced that the United States will not
                        initiate war so long as present Soviet methods of extending control by
                        “peaceful parliamentary penetration” are employed.</p>
                    <p>Should the Italian elections result in an unexpected defeat for the Communist
                        Party, the USSR will intensify its campaign to sabotage and destroy the
                        effectiveness of Western Union and the Marshall Plan. Every effort will be
                        exhausted to capture the French and Italian governments by making impossible
                        orderly government by any other political factions or coalitions.</p>
                    <p>However, should it become clear that Communist Party tactics in western
                        Europe are failing, that the Marshall Plan is successfully developing the
                        economic potential and political stability of non-Communist Europe, and that
                        the United States is prepared to extend military guarantees to Western
                        Union, then the Soviet Government may resort to direct military action. In
                        reaching such a decision, the Kremlin leaders would be convinced that
                        further delay favors the United States and Western Union and that war with
                        the United States offers the Soviet Union a reasonable chance of
                            success.<note n="4" xml:id="d14fn4">In the section on the “Analysis of
                            Political Factors” in Appendix A, these thoughts in relation to the
                            United States were summarized in these words: “The Kremlin has counted
                            on an economic crisis, the cumbersome methods of democratic governmental
                            machinery, and the indifference of American public opinion to foreign
                            affairs, particularly in a presidential election year, to weaken the
                            relative position of the United States. However, such events as the
                            institution of compulsory military training, expeditious implementation
                            of the Marshall Plan and the extension of military guarantees to Western
                            Union might easily cause a revision of such estimates. If the Kremlin
                            should conclude that the relative position of the two countries is
                            changing to the disadvantage of the U.S.S.R., it is conceivable that a
                            decision to risk war might at that time be taken.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The danger point will be reached when the leaders of the Soviet Government
                        become convinced that measures short of war are failings and, if events
                        favor the non-Communist world, such point could be reached as early as
                        within the present year, although it is far more likely that it will develop
                        between one and two years from now.</p>
                    <p>However, if the Kremlin is not convinced that it can hold and consolidate its
                        initial gains in the event of war with the United States, it still may not
                        take the decision to risk war and with the usual patient historical
                        perspective of Communists, await a more favorable time.</p>
                    <p>At that time of decision, the Soviet leaders will weigh their military,
                        economic and political resources as well as the morale of the Russian people
                        and their ability to support and withstand a long destructive war. If they
                        then believe that such a war eventually would seriously weaken the
                        “Communist Empire” and would threaten the very existence of the Soviet
                        regime and world Communism, they might temporarily renounce the conquest of
                        Western Europe and turn to consolidating Communist control of the Middle and
                        Far East and to creating <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0067"/>an
                        impregnable Communist fortress in Europe. They might then expect the
                        inherent weaknesses in the capitalist world to develop and the relative
                        position of the capitalist and Communist worlds to improve for the latter
                        over a period of years.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union will not risk war in the immediate future; however, there is
                        real danger of war within one or two years. The only deterrent at that time
                        would be solid conviction by the Soviet Government that in fact the United
                        States was preponderant in military strength and potential and that war
                        would eventually result in peril to the Communist regime.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Most of the recommendations in this National Security Council report deserve
                        our support. There is one general theme missing, however, that I consider of
                        the highest importance.</p>
                    <p>The writers of the report have stressed the measures to be taken to combat
                        the activities of the Communists themselves. The report gives little or no
                        attention to the problem of attacking Communism at its roots, by eliminating
                        the evils for which many Europeans consider Communism the cure. What I find
                        missing is the necessary stress on positive measures directed toward
                        building a democratic alternative.</p>
                    <p>It seems quite clear to me that Communism has grown in Western Europe not
                        simply through the activities of Soviet inspired and guided leaders, but as
                        a result of more fundamental causes. The Balkan states represented in
                        substantial degree the Marxist concept of monopoly—capitalism with wide
                        class differentials. The growth of Communism in Western countries is a
                        symptom that there has been, and is, something wrong in these countries, and
                        that it is so wrong that people seeking remedies have accepted even the
                        intellectual dishonesty and disregard for human rights that Communism—like
                        Fascism—represents. If this is true, it is not enough simply to cut off the
                        heads of Communists wherever they appear. One must go to the root of the
                        matter, creating conditions which are satisfactory enough so that Communism
                        will not exert the strong appeal which it now exerts in much of Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0068"/>
                    <p>Two conditions are necessary before Europe will be able to free itself of
                        this disease. One is an economic and political system that works well enough
                        to satisfy the legitimate needs and aspirations of the great majority of the
                        population in each country. The second is a burning faith in and enthusiasm
                        for democratic institutions that are consistent with, although not
                        necessarily identical with, our own democratic institutions.</p>
                    <p>Communism feeds on unemployment and economic distress. The European Recovery
                        Program is designed to bring about substantial improvement in the economic
                        health of Europe, and support for this Program should continue to be an
                        integral part of our overall foreign policy. I believe that our interest in
                        it goes, however, much further than simply seeing that the funds available
                        are used as efficiently as possible and distributed where they will achieve
                        the greatest good. We want to see Europe a functioning economic organism
                        with as full employment and as high a standard of living as possible. This
                        calls for a reduction in nationalism, and we should interest ourselves
                        intimately in the details of Europe’s recovery and developing integration
                        and we should throw all our weight behind plans that make economic sense for
                        an integrated Europe, and against economic measures that tend to be
                        disruptive or to favor small groups at the expense of others.</p>
                    <p>Communism also feeds on political frustration. There is wide-spread distrust
                        of politicians and of political democracy in many countries in Western
                        Europe. We obviously cannot interfere in the political institutions of these
                        countries but I believe we should give support to political parties that
                        offer Europeans a positive program suited to Europe’s political needs and
                        development, rather than looking for parties and individuals who seem to
                        represent most exactly the political and economic ideology that has been
                        successful in America. In effect, this may mean support of the moderate
                        Socialist parties of Europe.</p>
                    <p>Building enthusiasm, after or concurrently with economic and political
                        measures, requires an aggressive ideological campaign whose goal should be
                        the raising of a flag of human freedom that all European parties except the
                        authoritatively minded could rally around. We ourselves must show that
                        Democracy can work, and our campaign should stress the way it does work, at
                        its best. (This has obvious implications for our own internal policy, in
                        demonstrating by our own example that the Communist charges of instability,
                        exploitation, and discrimination are untrue.) We need to wage a much bigger
                        and more imaginative propaganda campaign than we are now doing, to arouse
                        the enthusiasm of Europeans for the democratic institutions which constitute
                        the main modern alternative to Communism. If we are to rob Communism of its
                        attraction as a panacea for Europe’s economic <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559"
                            facs="0069"/>and social ills, then we must support and publicize with
                        every means at our disposal the effective working out of our democratic
                        alternative.</p>
                    <p>As an example, we must convince European workingmen that our labor movement
                        is vital, vigorous and effective. At the moment, it is probably the
                        strongest in the world. A number of our best labor leaders should be
                        enlisted in going to Europe and boasting of their achievements in the United
                        States, instead of allowing the picture of American labor to be built up
                        from the debates on the Taft-Hartley Act.</p>
                    <p>Related to the above are my thoughts about the report’s proposal of measures
                        to “suppress the Communist menace in the United States” and abroad. It seems
                        clear to me that a positive program such as that suggested above will be
                        attacking the disease and make much less necessary the suppression of
                        Communist activities. Furthermore, I think there is a very real question
                        concerning how successful a program of suppression is likely to be in any
                        case. Measures to exclude Communists from Government positions and from jobs
                        in any strategic industry are certainly desirable. So are measures to
                        publicize the Communist affiliations and sympathies of all persons
                        demonstrated to have them. But if suppression means to put all Communists in
                        jail, I think the measure will defeat itself, as J. Edgar Hoover<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d15fn2">Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</note>
                        has suggested. It is much better to leave Communists enough civil liberties
                        so that they stay out in the open and can be identified than to drive them
                        under ground. This means, for example, that freedom of speech, of assembly
                        and of the press should probably not be denied to Communists, but it does
                        not at all mean that Communists should be recognized as political parties,
                        given time on the air as political parties, allocated newsprint where
                        newsprint is under allocation, or in any other way treated as a desirable
                        expression of a minority opinion. A program of discouragement that denies to
                        Communists all of the positive aids that political parties receive in this
                        country but allows them to exist above ground where their activities can be
                        identified without denying the basic freedoms for which our Democracy has
                        always stood, seems to me a more feasible treatment of Communists both in
                        this country and abroad than the program implied by the term “suppress” in
                        this report. We must avoid any appearances of behaving like a “police
                        state”.</p>
                    <p>Following the same general line of reasoning as my first major point, I
                        question the definition used on page 6, paragraph b3, where the
                        recommendation is made that we support the Western Union as “an
                        anti-Communist association of states”. I think it would lead to much more
                        effective action if in our thinking and our actions we considered the
                        Western Union and, in fact, the whole United States effort as being <pb
                            n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0070"/>pro-Democratic rather than
                        anti-Communist. Pro-Democratic of course implies anti-Communist, but it goes
                        far further in suggesting that emphasis be placed upon a constructive
                        alternative to Communism.</p>
                    <p>On page 7, paragraph 5, I have some question as to how far we should
                        rehabilitate the arms industry of non-Communist nations where their conquest
                        might leave such war potential resources in the hands of the Russians,
                        rather than continuing ourselves as the major arsenal of Democracy and
                        attempting to stress the economic rehabilitation of non-armament industries
                        in Western Europe particularly. This has a political as well as a military
                        aspect. To the extent that other countries expend their scarce economic
                        resources (fuel, power, manpower, raw materials) on armaments production
                        they will have proportionately less to devote to civilian production, and
                        their dependence on us for assistance in the form of civilian goods will be
                        thereby increased and prolonged. I think it will be politically easier and
                        make better military sense for us to look toward a time when these countries
                        are economically independent (exclusive of their war industries) and when we
                        provide the armaments, rather than looking toward a long continuing economic
                        dependence on us for both civilian and military supplies.</p>
                    <p>On page 8, paragraph 9, I think it is clear from my first major point that a
                        vigorous and effective ideological campaign should be given a much larger
                        part in our anti-Communist effort than seems to be implied in this
                        report.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 7, dated March 30, 1948, a paper on “The

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have studied <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 7,
                        a report by the National Security Council staff on “The Position of the
                        United States with Respect to Soviet-Directed World Communism”, and have
                        submitted their views with respect thereto to me. In order to give every
                        member of the Council the maximum opportunity to study these views before
                        the paper comes up for final consideration by the Council, I am, not
                        delaying their transmittal pending my own study thereof.</p>
                    <p>The views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are as follows:</p>
                    <p>They are in general agreement with the analysis contained in this paper,
                        particularly as to the critical nature of the world situation and the
                        necessity for a United States policy directed toward preservation of our
                        national security.</p>
                    <p>Their comment follows on those conclusions in the report which have military
                        implications. (The conclusions in each case are reproduced for ready
                        reference.)</p>

                            communism is vital to the security of the United States</hi>.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">This objective cannot be achieved by a defensive

                            organizing a world-wide counter-offensive aimed at mobilizing and

                            and at undermining the strength of the communist forces in the Soviet
                            world</hi>.</p>
                    <p>These conclusions are concurred in. It is assumed that they are to be
                        construed in a general sense, with reference to general attitude and

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff fully agree with the intent of these conclusions.
                        From the military viewpoint they regard the proposed measures not so much as
                        “immediate steps in the counter-offensive” as steps in arriving at
                        appropriate military readiness in light of the obviously worsening world
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>They believe that measures that should now be taken should provide not only
                        for increased military manpower (not limited to present peacetime strength)
                        but also for increased appropriations necessary for strengthening our
                        National Military Establishment. With respect to the proposed initiation of
                        civilian and industrial mobilization they believe, from the military point
                        of view, that because of the inherent and quite possibly critical length of
                        time required for legislative action, the necessary statutory authorizations
                        should be sought now for civilian and industrial readiness, such
                        authorizations to correspond to those found essential during World War II
                        and to be invoked as and to the extent required.</p>
                    <p>If political considerations should result in determination that this step is
                        not now practicable, every possible effort should be devoted now to advance
                        planning directed toward reduction to a minimum of the time lag between
                        decision and action when legislative steps of this nature do become
                        politically expedient.</p>
                    <p>In essence, the basic objectives should be that measures taken now for
                        strengthening promptly the National Military Establishment should meet at
                        least the requirements for effective emergency action, and that, to every
                        practicable extent, provision should be made for extending the scope of such
                        measures to all-out war effort without avoidable delay.</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not disagree with the intent of the conclusion
                        in subparagraph (a) above. From the military viewpoint, however, they must
                        point out the extreme importance to our national security of keeping our
                        military capabilities abreast of our military commitments. Thus, effective
                        implementation of the conclusion in subparagraph (a) above would be
                        impracticable if “unprovoked armed attack” should occur while our military
                        capabilities are inadequate. Therefore, this conclusion, if approved, will
                        make it more than ever essential to accomplish at once at least the degree
                        of military strengthening set forth in comment on conclusions 12 <hi

                        concurred in. Military conversations should, of course, not antedate
                        political decisions and commitments, and should remain within the scope of
                        such commitments and decisions.</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are unable to subscribe fully to this conclusion.
                        They believe that machine tools should be supplied only when their
                        exportation does not interfere with our own needs and that due consideration
                        should be given to the possibility that the Soviets may easily capture

                            communist aggression so as to avoid the possibility of an “accidental”
                            war through Soviet miscalculation of how far the Western Powers might be
                            pushed</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Because of the ambiguity of the phrases “unmistakably clear”, “opportune

                        broad, however, that the Joint Chiefs of Staff must again point out the
                        danger that would be involved in commitment to a policy inappropriate to
                        military strength. That is, they believe there should be due recognition of
                        the possibility (one with historical precedent) that we ourselves may
                        miscalculate how far we may go in opposition to the USSR, particularly
                        opposition unaccompanied by appropriate readiness, without causing the
                        Soviets to determine that immediate initiation of open warfare is, from
                        their viewpoint, mandatory.</p>

                        the military implications of the courses of action set forth and the

                        followed by some amplification and discussion based on careful consideration

                        generally applicable to the contents of the subject memorandum. Specific

                                appreciable strength will make partial mobilization a

                                of our National Military Establishment. Some form of compulsory
                                military service will be required to attain additional strength and

                                “Appreciable augmentation” in this statement is intended to mean
                                augmentation justifying other than relatively minor commitment of

                    <p>The statement in <hi rend="italic">c</hi> above is of major importance in
                        connection with the subject memorandum, since it is designed to make clear
                        that no military commitment with implications extending to likelihood of
                        major military involvement should be made unless preceded by mobilization. A
                        similar view was included in a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense dated

                    </p>
                    <p>The current belief that the USSR does not plan overt warfare for at least
                        five years is not necessarily correct and there is increasing doubt in many
                        quarters as to its soundness. In any event, circumstances may change, quite
                        possibly with considerable rapidity, in such a way as to invalidate the
                        “five-year” reasoning.</p>
                    <p>The current situation leaves no doubt that the USSR if <hi rend="italic"
                            >planning</hi> war only at a later date, may nevertheless miscalculate
                        the degree of our determination to resist further Soviet encroachment. Also,
                        unpredictable and little known internal conditions in the USSR could result
                        in Soviet decision to initiate war even though not presently planned.</p>
                    <p>A further, quite distinct, possibility (and one with historical precedent) is
                        that we ourselves may miscalculate how far we may go in opposition to the
                        Soviets, particularly opposition unaccompanied by appropriate readiness,
                        without causing them to determine that immediate initiation of open warfare
                        is, from their viewpoint, mandatory.</p>
                    <p>It is possible, though most unlikely, that open warfare, if and when it
                        develops, will be of a localized nature in one or more areas and hence
                        relatively minor for a considerable period. If this possibility could be
                        relied upon, it would indicate only that there may be time for real
                        preparedness if action to that end is taken now. If it cannot be relied
                        upon, which is at least equally probable, the steps necessary for real
                        preparedness should already have been initiated.</p>
                    <p>Since their primary peacetime interests and responsibilities rest in military
                        readiness appropriate to the world situation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do
                        not offer the possibility of continued peace as a result of a strengthened
                        United States military posture as a justification for preparedness. As they
                        see it, the point is, rather, that whether or not the probability of war
                        will be lessened by increasing our military strength, that probability will
                            <hi rend="italic">certainly continue and increase as long as we remain
                            weak</hi>.</p>
                    <p>It is fully realized that some calculated risks, in terms of over-all
                        national policy, must be taken. The question, however, is one of degree. In
                        simplest terms, it is plain that, whether or not either the USSR or the
                        United States now intends to persist in the present struggle to the extent
                        of open warfare, the possibility of this result is so evident that it would
                        be not a calculated but an incalculable risk for the United <pb n="567"
                            xml:id="pg_567" facs="0077"/>States to postpone further the steps for
                        readiness demanded by ordinary prudence.</p>
                    <p>While the Joint Chiefs of Staff should not be expected to make recommendation
                        as to whether or not the United States should risk major or global warfare,
                        it is manifestly their responsibility to point out that the consequences
                        would be very grave indeed if action, in advance of adequate military
                        readiness on our part, should lead unavoidably to major commitment.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, in light of the foregoing discussion and of the obviously
                        worsening world situation, and having further considered matters leading to

                        is responsible, among other things, for advising the President on policies
                        for establishing adequate reserves of strategic and critical materials, and

                        for the specific purpose of establishing stockpiles of strategic materials.
                        The Act of 1946, as altered by the subsequent National Security Act,
                        provides, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, for: 1) determination by the

                        strategic and critical and the quantities and qualities to be stockpiled.

                        Strategic Materials consists of representatives from the Department of

                        agencies are included in the deliberations when their fields of interest are
                        involved. The terms of reference of the group are: 1) to consider problems
                        of availabilities and procurement of strategic materials from foreign
                        countries; 2) to facilitate the collection of and to evaluate information
                        regarding availabilities of strategic materials in foreign countries; 3) to
                        facilitate the preparation of programs for acquiring such materials in other
                        countries; and 4) to make recommendations with respect to the fulfillment of
                        various aspects of this assignment to the <gloss target="#t_ECEFP1"

                        <hi rend="italic">Problems Connected With Recovery Program</hi>. Thus far
                        most of the problems considered by the Working Group on Strategic Materials
                        have been in connection with the European Recovery Program. Legislation
                        authorizing the Program provides for facilitating the transfer of
                        commodities needed by the US because of deficiencies or potential
                        deficiencies in its own resources for stockpiling or other purposes. The
                        legislative history shows that these other purposes are primarily the
                        transfer of iron and steel scrap which would not be stockpiled and other
                        materials of strategic character which would be put into immediate use and
                        not stockpiled. The <gloss target="#t_ECEFP1">ECEFP</gloss> Working Group is
                        now considering the inclusion of proper safeguards in the bilateral
                        agreements to be negotiated with the participating countries and has
                        appointed working parties to make investigations of the possibility of
                        increasing production in territories of countries participating in the
                        Program. These parties will then proceed to consider problems outside the
                        Recovery Program area. The bilateral agreements will contain only general
                        commitments for the governments to facilitate the transfer of strategic
                        materials to the US, to stimulate increased production, and to use their
                        good offices to secure cooperation of enterprises subject to their
                        jurisdiction. Goals and specific measures for achievement of special
                        programs will be the subject of supplementary agreements.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ECEFP1">ECEFP</gloss> Working Group recognizes that the
                        political relations between the mother country and dependent areas will be
                        important factors in the fulfillment of US goals. It is not yet clear to
                        what degree the mother countries will be able to undertake to guarantee
                        delivery of materials from areas which are classified as dependent. As yet
                        there has been little or no comment on how the local populations have
                        reacted to the proposals for expanded production and transfer of stocks to
                        the US. It is anticipated that business enterprises in the colonial areas
                        may resent shipments of materials to Europe which are to be paid for by
                        shipments of raw materials from the dependent areas.</p>

                        Heretofore the Munitions Board in purchasing materials for stockpiling has
                        restricted itself to materials which the Department of Commerce has not
                        found to be in short supply for civilian use. Proposals under consideration
                        in the <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> would provide that the
                        Munitions Board should proceed to build up stockpiles after consulting with
                        the Department of Commerce with respect to supplies that are necessary to
                        meet only essential civilian needs. An alternative proposal would apply this
                        formula only to stocks held by RFC. In line with this trend the Department
                        of Commerce has removed all commodities from its Civilian Deficiency List
                        (which has governed Munitions Board stockpile policy) except three—antimony,
                        tin and quinidine.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>I feel that the United States position with respect to employment of
                            atomic weapons, and our Governmental organization for expeditious
                            application of atomic warfare, require early and careful review in the
                            interest of national security.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It appears necessary, in order to insure a clear understanding on the
                            part of all agencies responsible for various aspects of United States
                            security, that a high level decision be taken as to the intention of the
                            United States to employ atomic weapons in event of war. While the
                            Department of the Army has been conducting its war planning on the basis
                            that atomic weapons would be used, I believe there is some doubt that
                            such employment is a firm United States Government policy. I understand
                            that in some quarters the desirability of the United States initiating
                            atomic warfare has been questioned particularly on the grounds of
                            morality. I recognize that many considerations other than purely
                            military must be taken into account in arriving at a decision in this
                            regard.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>In addition to the basic question of engaging in or initiating atomic
                            warfare there arises a question of what agent or agency of the
                            Government shall be empowered to authorize actual employment. Employment
                            might be undertaken by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on their own
                            initiative, or the decision to authorize employment might be reserved to
                            the President or to some other agent of the Government. It is important
                            that this authority and responsibility be made perfectly clear in order
                            that there will be no delay in acting in event the United States is
                            subjected to sudden attack. Equally important is a consideration of the
                            time and circumstances under which atomic weapons might be employed, and
                            the type and character of targets against which they might be
                            used.</item>

                        <item>To develop further United States capacity for actual engagement in
                            atomic warfare, the National Military Establishment must organize its

                            are: <list>

                        the necessary manpower from among its own citizens for its own Service and
                        has to recruit foreign mercenaries abroad. It is obvious what use Soviet
                        propaganda will make of such a development . . . . If the Department of the
                        Army could be persuaded to amend this Bill so as to make it an immigration
                        rather than a recruitment measure on the principle of giving preferential or
                        non-quota status under the immigration law to aliens who had declared their
                        intention of enlisting in the U.S. Army upon arrival here, the chief
                        disadvantages from the point of View of foreign policy to this measure would
                        be mitigated.” (811.2221/2–2348)</note> Out of deference to your
                    Department’s viewpoint and in the interest of maintaining a united front, the
                    Department of the Army in February notified Senator Lodge and Senator Gurney
                    that support must be withdrawn from the bill. This action did not change the
                    basic concept of the Department of the Army that enlistment of qualified
                    displaced aliens abroad would be desirable.</p>
                <p>On 19 March 1948 a memorandum relative to this entire subject<note n="4"
                        xml:id="d21fn4">Not printed.</note> was sent to the Secretary of Defense
                    recommending support, of the bill if amended as proposed. This recommendation
                    was approved and discussion was reopened with your Department. Conferences were
                    held on 30 March 1948 and 16 April 1948 between representatives of the
                    Department of the Army and Mr. Bohlen of your Department. At these conferences
                    an attempt was made to reconcile the difference in viewpoint concerning the
                    desirability of passage of the Lodge bill. To this end an effort was made to
                    draft a new bill or amend an existing bill in order to accomplish the purposes
                    of the Lodge bill, but at the same time not incorporate features objectionable
                    to your Department. No such solution was found. At the present time the
                    Department of the <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0085"/>Army is prepared to
                    support enactment of the Lodge bill as a means to obtain additional manpower on
                    a voluntary basis. A manpower pool from which it is believed approximately
                    50,000 qualified nonenemy aliens could be recruited exists in the United States
                    Occupied Zones of Europe. Included in this estimate are 12,000 of the 14,500 men
                    currently employed by occupation authorities in quasi military guard and labor
                    roles. Individuals included in this estimate are between 18 and 35 years of age;
                    meet present physical, intelligence, and educational standards; and possess good
                    character.</p>
                <p>I would appreciate obtaining your present reaction to the Lodge bill and will be
                    glad to furnish any desired additional data on this subject now in the
                    possession of the Department of the Army.<note n="5" xml:id="d21fn5">On June 8,
                        the Senate approved an amendment (introduced by Senator Lodge) to the
                        Selective Service Act by which the Secretary of the Army was authorized to
                        enlist 25,000 aliens for five years’ service, after which they would be
                        eligible for citizenship. On June 14, Marshall informed Secretary Royall
                        that in his opinion there was no further action which the Department of
                        State should take on the matter.</note>

                <p>2. The Committee’s instructions were in two parts—to examine into the factors
                    affecting the armament situation of the non-Soviet nations (SANA–5827,<note
                        n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Not printed.</note> Para. 1<hi rend="italic">a</hi>),
                    and to formulate a policy governing all transfers to foreign countries of
                    military supplies of U.S. origin (SANA–5827, para. 1<hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>).</p>
                <p>3. With respect to the first part of the instructions, it was the Committee’s
                    view that these factors had already been sufficiently investigated for its
                    purposes. Reference is made particularly to the <gloss target="#t_SANACC1"

                    nations has been referred to the Rearmament Subcommittee (SANA–5975).<note n="7"

                </p>
                <p>5. Accordingly, the Committee excluded from its consideration these questions
                    which are already resolved or are being considered elsewhere, and addressed
                    itself to the general principles which the United States Government should apply
                    in deciding whether to transfer military supplies of United States origin to a
                    foreign country, in the absence of a controlling policy already established for
                    that country. Conclusions reached by the Committee are therefore not directed to
                    transfers made in pursuance of an established policy or program of military
                    assistance.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">conclusions</hi>
                </p>
                <p>6. Pending the achievement of conditions of international confidence which would
                    make possible the putting into effect of a system for the regulation and
                    reduction of armaments, it should be the policy of the United States to
                    authorize transfers to foreign countries, by sale or otherwise, of military
                    supplies of United States origin, whether such supplies are of government or
                    private ownership, if the transfers are determined to be in the interest of the
                    United States and not inconsistent with the security interest of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>7. In addition to the primary requirement of being in the interest of the United
                    States, such transfers should also be determined to be reasonable or necessary
                    for one or more of the following purposes: <list>

                <p>8. In determining whether a particular transfer of military supplies to a foreign
                    country will be in the interest of the United States, the following factors
                    should be considered, together with any others that may be appropriate at the
                    time: <list>

                <p>The Working Group has considered problems of availability and procurement of
                    those items listed for stockpiling which require special and urgent action
                    because of failure to meet targets and which are known to occur in some quantity
                    in participating countries. Interagency task groups were established covering
                    agreed upon commodities (fourteen in number) and recommendations are submitted
                    based upon data accumulated which is believed to cover all information available
                    at this time. The recommendations offered are in the main directed towards
                    action which may be taken by the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                        >ECA</gloss> under Article XI of the Master Economic Cooperation Agreement.
                    Coordinate or supplementary action may be required by other agencies. Additional
                    work is being carried on with regard to other commodities and other areas of the
                        world.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">On August 3, 1948, the Working Group on

                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1. Immediate attention should be given to the obtaining of more adequate
                    information. In this connection, technical personnel, including engineers and
                    minerals specialists, should be located at given points in the field to report
                    on all projects, recommend appropriate action, and expedite programs. It is
                    recommended that the Secretary of State request the interested departments and
                    agencies including the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> to
                    cooperate in discussions looking toward the employment of such a staff at the
                    earliest possible moment and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication.</p>
                <p>2. In general, increased production of strategic commodities is necessary to
                    permit more rapid acquisition by the stockpiling authorities. Pursuant to
                    Section 117 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the Economic Cooperation Act<note
                        n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">Section 117(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) stated that the
                        Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> “shall, whenever
                        practicable, promote, by means of funds made available for the purposes of
                        this title, an increase in the production in such participating country of
                        materials which are required by the United States as a result of
                        deficiencies or potential deficiencies-in resources within the United
                        States.” (62 Stat (pt. 1)153)</note> the Administrator of <gloss
                        target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> should give attention to arrangements for such
                    increases in the following cases: chromite, copper, manganese, quinidine, tin,
                    columbite, nickel, lead, cobalt, and crushing bort. More specific comments with
                    reference to each will be found in the attached report. It is recommended that
                        <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> and the Munitions Board each call the
                    attention of the Administrator of the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and
                    other departments and agencies of the Government having power to act in
                    connection with developmental programs in foreign countries to the opportunities
                    for increasing supplies of strategic materials as they become known and request
                    that they use their authority to promote such programs. The Administrator of the
                        <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and other agencies should be prepared to
                    give assistance to participating countries in providing equipment, supplies, and
                    technical services in connection with specific projects. It may be necessary to
                    use priorities, to advance credit, and to shift specific equipment orders from
                    one supplier to another.</p>
                <p>3. Immediate attention should be given to improving transportation, including
                    port facilities, in a number of areas. Such action will produce the quickest
                    results in terms of an immediate increase in the flow of materials. The Working
                    Group recommends that the <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> and Munitions
                    Board call the Administrator’s attention to transportation difficulties in
                    Rhodesia, the Belgian Congo, Mozambique, the Gold Coast and French Morocco.
                    Qualified personnel on the spot are necessary to determine the exact action
                    needed.</p>
                <p>4. The Working Group suggests that the Munitions Board make use of long-term
                    contracts for strategic materials to the extent practicable <pb n="582"
                        xml:id="pg_582" facs="0092"/>in order to encourage new development.
                    Coordination of such contracts with action by the Administrator of <gloss
                        target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> is important.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Specific</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Working Group has concluded that immediate action is possible in the
                    following cases:</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Chromite from Southern Rhodesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>At the beginning of 1948 it was reported that 400,000 tons of chromite were
                    stockpiled at mine heads awaiting shipment. The port from which shipment takes
                    place is located in Mozambique, a dependency of Portugal. Immediate discussions
                    with the United Kingdom, Southern Rhodesia, and Portugal should be instituted
                    with a view to improvement of rail and port facilities and increased shipment of
                    chromite. The <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss> and Munitions Board should
                    request the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> to undertake
                    these discussions with the assistance of the State Department.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Crushing Bort from the Belgian Congo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Approximately 95 percent of crushing bort comes from the Belgian Congo.
                    Production of this material is under the control of the “diamond cartel”.
                    Representatives of the State Department have had discussions with
                    representatives of the Belgian Government with respect to increased
                    availabilities of bort for the U.S. strategic stockpile. The Working Group
                    recommends that representatives of the Department consult with the Administrator
                    of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> for the purpose of continuing such
                    discussions with a view to determining the potentialities of and the
                    requirements for increased production and the transfer of increased supplies
                    directly to the United States Government agencies for stockpiling purposes.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Quinidine from the Netherlands East Indies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Netherlands East Indies ordinarily produces 90 percent of the cinchona bark
                    from which quinine and quinidine are produced. It appears that certain
                    restrictive business practices are limiting the quantity of quinidine made
                    available. It is recommended that representatives of the State Department and
                    the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, in consultation, begin
                    discussions with representatives of the Netherlands Government to determine what
                    action is necessary to obtain increased supplies of quinidine or of cinchona
                    bark from which it is prepared.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Manganese from Gold Coast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Gold Coast is the largest producer of manganese in the world outside of the
                    U.S.S.R. Production reached a peak of 721,000 tons in 1946, declined to about
                    540,000 tons in 1947, and is estimated at the yearly rate of 730,000 tons for
                    the first months of 1948. It is estimated that production could be increased to
                    830,000 tons. It is recommended that the <gloss target="#t_NSRB1">NSRB</gloss>
                    and Munitions Board should request the Administrator <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583"
                        facs="0093"/>of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and the State Department
                    to undertake discussions with the producers and with the Governments of the
                    United Kingdom and the Gold Coast to expand production and eliminate
                    transportation bottlenecks with a view to increasing production to the extent
                    possible.</p>

                <p>On June 24, 1948, President Truman signed the Selective Service Act of 1948, “An

                    Forces of the United States, Including the Reserve Components Thereof,” Public

                    passed by Congress on June 19, provided for the induction of enough 19–25 year
                    olds to maintain the strength of the armed forces at 2,005,882. The Universal
                    Military Training program sought by the Administration was not included. Rather,
                    up to 161,000 18 year olds were permitted to avoid draft liability by
                    volunteering for service of one year with regular forces followed by a reserve

                    <p>1. To assess and appraise the position of the United States with respect to
                        providing military assistance in the form of supplies, equipment and
                        technical advice to nations of the non-Soviet world.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>2. The success of certain free nations in resisting aggression by the forces
                        of Soviet directed world communism is of critical importance to the security
                        of the United States. Some of these nations require not only economic
                        assistance but also strengthened military capabilities if they are to
                        continue and make more effective their political resistance to communist
                        subversion from within and Soviet pressure from without and if they are to
                        develop ultimately an increased military capability to withstand external
                        armed attack. Although they possess <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0096"
                        />considerable military potential in manpower and resources, these nations
                        are industrially incapable of producing intricate modern armaments and
                        equipment in the necessary quantities. Consequently if they are to develop
                        stronger military capabilities it is essential that their own efforts be
                        effectively coordinated and be supplemented by assistance in the form of
                        military supplies, equipment and technical advice from the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>3. Such military assistance from the United States would not only strengthen
                        the moral and material resistance of the free nations, but would also
                        support their political and military orientation toward the United States,
                        augment our own military potential by improvement of our armaments
                        industries, and through progress in standardization of equipment and
                        training increase the effectiveness of military collaboration between the
                        United States and its allies in the event of war.</p>
                    <p>4. US military assistance to foreign nations since Lend-Lease does not appear
                        to have sprung from any well-coordinated program. The practice in general
                        has been to provide surplus US equipment to nations urgently in need of
                        strengthening or as a measure of US political interest. In some instances,
                        spare parts, ammunition, and means of maintenance have been furnished at the
                        time of the original transfer, but no system for a continuing supply of
                        ammunition and maintenance items has been evolved.</p>
                    <p>5. There is at present an extensive but not a comprehensive legislative basis
                        for the provision of military assistance. The following legislative
                        authorizations for transferring US military equipment to foreign nations are

                        how, when and to what extent.</p>
                    <p>6. Effective implementation of a policy of strengthening the military
                        capabilities of free nations would be facilitated by the early <pb n="587"
                            xml:id="pg_587" facs="0097"/>enactment of legislation broadening the
                        authority of the President to provide military assistance under appropriate
                        conditions. Title VI (not enacted) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1948 was
                        designed to provide this authority.<note n="6" xml:id="d27fn6">Regarding the
                            proposed legislation, see footnote 3, <ref target="#pg_597">p.
                            597</ref>.</note> The proposed Title VI would have authorized the
                        President to furnish assistance to foreign governments, provided such
                        assistance was determined to be consistent with the national interest, and
                        was without cost to the United States except where appropriations are made
                        by Congress. On the basis of legislation along these lines, it would be
                        possible to work out, in the United States and in the course of possible
                        military staff conversations with selected non-communist nations, a
                        coordinated military assistance program in which the quotas of each
                        recipient would be related to overall needs, production capabilities,
                        political considerations and strategic concepts. Pending the complete
                        formulation of such an overall program, funds might be immediately
                        appropriated to meet the urgent requirements of selected non-communist
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>7. The State–Army–Navy–Air Force Coordinating Committee has devoted
                        considerable study to the problem of military assistance to foreign nations
                        and related questions (<gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss> 360 series,
                        382 series). The conclusions of the present <hi rend="italic">Report</hi>
                        are based in part upon these <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss>
                        papers and are in substantial accord with the general trend of thought
                        embodied therein.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>8. Certain free nations the security of which is of critical importance to
                        the United States require strengthened military capabilities, if they are to
                        present effective political resistance to communist aggression now, and
                        military resistance later if necessary.</p>
                    <p>9. Therefore, the United States should assist in strengthening the military
                        capabilities of these nations to resist communist expansion provided they
                        make determined efforts to resist communist expansion and such assistance
                        contributes effectively to that end. For this purpose the United States
                        should provide them with assistance in the form of military supplies,
                        equipment, and technical advice under a coordinated program in conformity
                        with the principles set forth in paragraph 12 below.</p>

                                Assistance Act of 1948 would be a suitable basis for such

                    <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Appraisal of the Degree and Character of Military
                        Preparedness Required by the World Situation</p>
                    <p>The preparation of budget estimates for Fiscal Year 1950 is one of the most
                        important tasks before the National Military Establishment during the next
                        ninety days. The size and character of these estimates will largely
                        determine the nature of our military strength until July 1, 1950. Moreover,
                        because of the time factor involved in any military build-up, such estimates
                        will also materially affect our capabilities in the years immediately
                        thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Decisions concerning the optimum military budget under all the circumstances
                        must be responsive to many factors which are not entirely within the purview
                        of the National Military Establishment and with respect to which the
                        Military Establishment requires firm guidance. Since the entire reason for
                        the maintenance of military forces in this country is the safeguarding of
                        our national security, their size, character, and composition should turn
                        upon a careful analysis of existing and potential dangers to our security
                        and upon decisions as; to the methods by which such dangers can best be met
                        within the <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0100"/>limitations of our
                        resources. Sound military planning presupposes determinations by the
                        appropriate Governmental authorities as to the ways in which, and the times
                        at which, the security of the United States may be endangered. Moreover,
                        since these various dangers may be of both a military and a non-military
                        character, decisions must then be reached as to the respective roles which
                        military strength and other activities directed toward our national
                        security—foreign aid, for example—should each play in an over-all security
                        program designed to forestall these dangers. These decisions must clearly
                        reflect our national objectives, and must take into account such collateral
                        factors as the psychological effects of varying degrees of military
                        strength, both upon potential forces and upon friends, and of existing or
                        probable international commitments.</p>
                    <p>Having made these basic decisions as to our objectives and as to the role of
                        military strength in achieving them, we can then proceed to consider the
                        share of our national resources which must be allocated to support military
                        activities and, within the limit of such resources, the kind of military
                        establishment best adapted to furthering these objectives. If the dangers
                        are great, immediate and of a military character, this fact should be
                        clearly reflected in our military budget and our military strength adapted
                        accordingly. If the risks are small, if they are distant rather than
                        immediate, or if they are primarily of a non-military character, military
                        estimates should be adjusted to accord with this situation. Not only the
                        general size of the military budget, but also the particular purposes toward
                        which it is directed, should be responsive to these conditions. They may
                        materially affect decisions as to whether we should concentrate all funds
                        available for military purposes on the strengthening of our own forces or
                        should allocate a portion thereof for the equipping of the forces of our
                        probable Allies. For example, if time permits, it might prove more
                        economical, or strategically sounder, to devote a certain percentage of such
                        funds to the armament of forces of the Western Union countries rather than
                        to employ the same amounts to create additional divisions of our own. While
                        a decision in this regard would naturally involve political as well as
                        military considerations, such a decision cannot be made without the
                        appraisal of risks and the determination of objectives to which I have
                        referred. The same considerations will influence the relative emphasis which
                        is to be placed in our military budget on the creation of regular divisions
                        in being, as opposed to a longer range program for the strengthening of our
                        civilian components; the amount to be set aside for the augmentation of our
                        war reserve; the rate at which we stockpile materials; the importance of
                        instituting negotiations for military bases overseas, and even the location
                        of such bases; the desirability and urgency of joint military planning with
                        other nations; <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0101"/>the direction to be
                        followed in our research and development programs; and many other similar
                        factors. Moreover, with the heavy and continuing impact of scientific
                        progress on the art of warfare, it is important to reach some conclusions as
                        to whether we should primarily shape our forces for the kind of war which
                        might be fought tomorrow or for the possibly very different form of conflict
                        which might occur if hostilities should break out some five or ten years
                        hence.</p>
                    <p>I think it is desirable to bring the foregoing generalizations into the
                        context of the immediate present. I assume that within the next decade, no
                        country other than Russia, and no likely combination of countries which did
                        not include Russia or expect her active support, would be likely to
                        undertake a war directed against the United States. It does not follow, of
                        course, that some country, or combination of countries, will not
                        miscalculate the risks and, by taking some aggressive action or
                        precipitating some local conflict, create a situation in which the United
                        States might be required to use military force to protect its own security
                        or to prevent a breakdown in world order. It therefore becomes important to
                        appraise, as best we can, the likelihood of some of the following
                        developments: An aggressive war by Russia; a conflict precipitated by some
                        miscalculation on the part of Russia or one of her satellites; Communist
                        expansion through power diplomacy, through the creation of internal
                        dissension and civil strife, or through political terrorism and propaganda;
                        the outbreak of a major war as a result of some eruption in one of the
                        “tinder-box” areas of the world. Until these risks are appraised and their
                        nature defined, and until a determination has been made as to the best
                        methods of removing or meeting them, no logical decisions can be reached as
                        to the proportion of our resources which should be devoted to military
                        purposes, nor as to the character of forces which the military establishment
                        should seek to foster and support, both here and in friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing considerations, I believe that it is imperative that
                        a comprehensive statement of national policy be prepared, particularly as it
                        relates to Soviet Russia, and that this statement specify and evaluate the
                        risks, state our objectives, and outline the measures to be followed in
                        achieving them. For the reasons I have given, such a statement is needed to
                        guide the National Military Establishment in determining the level and
                        character of armament which it should seek and, I believe, to assist the
                        President in determining the proportion of our resources which should be
                        dedicated to military purposes. I also believe that it is fundamental to
                        decisions concerning the size of, and relative emphasis in, our national
                        budget.</p>
                    <p>The preparation of such a statement is, in my opinion, clearly a function of
                        the National Security Council since this work requires, to use the language
                        of the National Security Act, “the integration of <pb n="592"
                            xml:id="pg_592" facs="0102"/>domestic, foreign and military policies
                        relating to the national security” so that advice and guidance may be given
                        to the President and the several military services. Because many of the
                        basic issues involved concern matters which are within the province of the
                        Department of State, I suggest that the Department of State be asked to
                        draft an initial statement of this character which could be used as a basis
                        for discussion in the Council<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">In a memorandum of
                            May 27, Kennan had informed Lovett that Secretary Forrestal had

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am convinced that the
                        formulation of a sound military program and intelligent decisions concerning
                        the size and character of our future Armed Forces depend upon a prior
                        determination of our basic national objectives, and of the roles which
                        military strength and other non-military activities should play in
                        furthering these objectives. Similarly, I believe that the preparation of
                        realistic budget estimates and final decisions concerning the size of the
                        national budget, and its relative emphasis on different projects, should be
                        founded on such an evaluation. Specific programs of the National <pb n="593"
                            xml:id="pg_593" facs="0103"/>Military Establishment and other
                        departments can only be justified as they are related to such fundamental
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>For the foregoing reasons, I am forwarding the attached memorandum to the
                        National Security Council requesting the preparation of a statement which
                        specifies and evaluates the risks of the future, states our objectives, and
                        outlines the measures to be followed in achieving: them. I believe such a
                        statement is indispensable to the National Military Establishment in
                        determining the level and character of forces which it should maintain. This
                        statement would also, in my opinion, greatly assist you in the ultimate
                        decision which you must make as to the proportion of our resources which
                        must be dedicated to military purposes. Because a large majority of the
                        basic issues involved concern matters which are within the province of the
                        Department of State, I have recommended that the State Department be asked
                        to prepare a first draft of such a statement.</p>
                    <p>I bring this matter to your attention because I believe that this project is
                        one in which you will be interested and which should be given the highest
                        possible priority.</p>

                <p>4. It is concluded that before embarking upon a course of military assistance to
                    a foreign nation the following factors should be considered: <list>
                        <label>
                            <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</label>
                        <item>U.S. foreign policy may be substantially impaired in certain of its
                            objectives if the result of U.S. military assistance (excluding war or
                            threats of war) is the possible alienation of a friendly nation through
                            early breakdown of that military assistance.</item>
                        <label>
                            <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.</label>
                        <item>It may well prove inimical to our national interest to transfer
                            military equipment to a foreign nation without considering the possible
                            future need for replacements and spare parts and without having or
                            clearly foreseeing the means to furnish such needed replacements and
                            spare parts.</item>

                        <item>The size and cost (present and continued) of a military assistance
                            program should be carefully studied in relation to its economic
                            feasibility to avoid an unremunerative dissipation of U.S. resources,
                            excessive foreign commitments or contributing to an undue burden upon a
                            friendly nation.</item>

                        <item>In cases where military assistance is considered sufficiently
                            important to the national interest of the United States, supporting or
                            financing through U.S. means should be given policy consideration when
                            the recipient nation cannot wholly or in part support the required
                            program.</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>5. A complete and accurate report should be prepared for Congressional
                    consideration, in cases of those countries where U.S. Government support or
                    financing is required.</p>
                <p>6. Appropriate subcommittees in coordination with Rearmament Subcommittee of
                        <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss> should be charged with making
                    recommendation to <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss> twice a year with

                <p>7. Prior to approval of a program of military assistance of long-term concern to
                    the U.S. which involves considerable quantities of munitions, the approving
                    authority should review the proposed program in the light of the questions posed

                <p>The following are my views on this subject: <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>I have told Mr. Souers that while I understand the need for the best
                            attempts we can make at estimates of this sort, I think we should be on
                            guard against exaggerating the value of such estimates in solving the
                            problems Mr. Forrestal has in mind. To support this statement I have
                            pointed out: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The world situation is now extremely fluid. No one can make
                                    predictions with any certainty. The possibilities are widely
                                    varying ones; the developments could move at any time in one of
                                    several widely varying directions.</item>

                                <item>The world situation is not something which exists
                                    independently of our defense policy and to which we need only
                                    react. It will be deeply influenced by the measures which we
                                    ourselves take. Our adversaries are extremely flexible in their
                                    policies and will adjust themselves rapidly and effectively to
                                    whatever we may do. Our policies must therefore be viewed not
                                    only as a means of reacting to a given situation, but as a means
                                    of influencing a situation as well.</item>

                                <item>In most cases where Mr. Forrestal’s memo implies that we are
                                    faced with choices, the answer is not ‘“either/or” but “both”.
                                    We cannot possibly say that we should be prepared for a war
                                    either in 1950 or in 1952 or any other date; that we intend to
                                    achieve our objectives either by military means or by
                                    non-military means; etc. These <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600"

                                    which must be determined from day to day in the light of rapidly

                    <p>The Department of State is believed to be the appropriate Agency to prepare
                        the first two studies on threats and objectives, and has in fact already
                        prepared a paper entitled “Factors affecting the nature of the United States
                        defense arrangements in the light of Soviet policies”.<note n="4"

                        <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0111"/>This paper, broadened to include an
                        estimate of probable Soviet non-military activities, might serve as the
                        estimate of the threats. I understand that the Department of State is also
                        engaged in the preparation of a paper on our objectives with respect to
                        Russia. It is, therefore, recommended that the Council agree that the
                        Department of State will prepare the first two studies enumerated above.</p>
                    <p>The third study on a program, however, will require the assistance of the
                        other Departments and Agencies on the Council since this program will
                        include military measures and must be planned in the light of our domestic
                        resources. Development of this program, however, should be deferred until
                        after the Council has adopted, and the President has approved, the first two
                        studies on threats and objectives. Based upon these studies, it is believed
                        that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff might furnish an
                        appropriate vehicle for coordinating the preparation of the third study on a

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Reference is made to my letter of
                    July 24, 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d32fn1">Not printed.</note> in which I
                    requested that the Department of the Army be furnished with a current revision
                    of State Department document <gloss target="#t_PCA1">PCA</gloss>/PD–11, dated
                    August 20, 1947, subject: “Policy with respect to Relative Priorities for
                    Receipt of U.S. Military Supplies.”<note n="1" xml:id="d32fn7">Not
                        printed.</note>
                </p>
                <p>Since the referenced letter was written, requirements for the member nations of
                    Western Union, particularly France, have become imminent. Even though assistance
                    programs in connection with these countries do not have final approval, it is
                    necessary to accord them priorities with respect to other programs in order to
                    facilitate requisite planning and to determine availabilities of equipment.
                    Another development, since my June 24th letter, is the mounting of pressures in
                    connection with the aid program to China.</p>
                <p>As has been mentioned we do not yet have governmental approval for programs of
                    assistance in connection with the Western Union nations. However, in view of the
                    implications of the Vandenberg resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">For text of
                        Senate Resolution 239 (the Vandenberg Resolution), June 11, 1948, which
                        expressed support for the association of the United States with regional
                        collective defense arrangements, see <ref target="frus1948v03#pg_135">vol.

                    14/1 (The Position of the United States with Respect to Providing Military
                    Assistance to Nations of the Non-Soviet World),<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">Of

                    July 10, 1948, I feel that it is merely a matter of time until programs of
                    assistance materialize in connection with the Western Union nations. As you
                    know, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 14/1 provides that first priority for
                    programs of military assistance should be given to nations of Western
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>From a military point of view, I recommend that priorities in connection with

                <p>As requested the following comments and suggestions are submitted relative to the
                    subject matter of Mr. Rusk’s memorandum of July 27, transmitting a copy of Mr.
                        Jessup’s<note n="1" xml:id="d36fn1">Philip C. Jessup, Deputy Chief of the
                        United States Mission at the United Nations.</note> letter to him.<note
                        n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Neither the memorandum nor the letter is
                        printed.</note> It will be recalled that that memorandum and letter asked
                    how we could meet anti-American propaganda directed by Moscow to the emergent
                    nations of Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>There is every indication that Moscow is turning more and more attention to the
                    Far East, particularly to Southeast Asia, and it can be expected that that
                    attention will be expressed by intensified propaganda stressing Soviet
                    friendship for colonial peoples and attacking the US as condoning and even
                    leading the imperialist exploitation of such peoples. We have, therefore, the
                    pressing problem, and one that will continue so long as the Soviet and the US
                    are in diametrically opposed camps and accept fundamentally contradictory
                    ideologies, of convincing the peoples of Southeast Asia that Moscow is not their
                    real champion, that Soviet tactics have an ulterior and far from altruistic
                    motive, that the US is desirous of their ultimate obtention of independence, and
                    that the US is sincerely and unselfishly interested in their progress.</p>
                <p>Propaganda countering that of Moscow is the first means of orienting the peoples
                    of Southeast Asia away from the Soviets and towards the US. Our propaganda
                    program should be <hi rend="italic">aggressive</hi> as we are laying the
                    foundation for the future—in a few years most if not all of the major oriental
                    races will have emerged as nations and will be in a position to form an oriental
                    bloc for or against us.</p>
                <p>One part of our attack should emphasize the inequities of Soviet policy and
                    purpose by making clear to the peoples of Southeast Asia that communism and
                    nationalism are not one and the same thing, that communist penetration is
                    incompatible with and spells the end of independence, and that a communist state
                    is but a satellite of Moscow with no scope for uncontrolled action or thought.
                    We have plenty of ammunition for this attack in the examples of Yugoslavia,
                    Czechoslovakia, Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and others.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the Soviet record of infiltration, broken pledges, <pb n="608"
                        xml:id="pg_608" facs="0118"/>elimination of sincere nationalists, and
                    smothering of liberties, we should present our case by employing some if not all
                    of the following: <list>
                        <label>(1)</label>
                        <item>Make known that US policy towards emergent nations is to grant full
                            political recognition at the earliest possible moment and to support
                            their active participation in the family of nations. In this we can make
                            use of our record in the Philippines, in the Good Offices Committee in

                        <item>Publicize our readiness to loan technical experts in the fields of
                            economic and social endeavor to emergent nations, so as to prepare them
                            to take their place and compete in the modern world. As a part of this
                            we can encourage American business interests to initiate and enlarge
                            their efforts in trade and industrial relations, stressing the positive
                            contribution American business can make and disabusing the peoples of
                            Southeast Asia of the idea that American business means exploitation <hi
                                rend="italic">per se.</hi></item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>Initiate and advertise a substantial program of bringing qualified
                            students to the US for educational and training purposes, so that these
                            students may take back to their countries a full knowledge of our ideas
                            and ways of life and be able to contrast our freedoms with the lack of
                            liberties in Soviet-controlled lands.</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>The efforts of missionary and religious organizations which emphasize educational
                    and medical work should be of propaganda value.</p>
                <p>By the above we should be able to demonstrate the fallacies extant and inherent
                    in Soviet propaganda, to bring into the clear the practical benefits of
                    orientation towards the US and, by implication, the unhappy results of not
                    following such orientation. In all this we should definitely avoid the
                    appearance of being dependent upon the emergent nations but should endeavor to
                    “put across” the idea that their independence and future prosperity depend
                    solely upon the US.</p>
                <p>Much can be done in the immediate future and as a long-range program by <gloss
                        target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> activities expressed through the printed
                    word, by visual means, and with the radio. <hi rend="italic">We should outdo by
                        repetition and emphasis</hi> the repetitious anti-US propaganda now flowing
                    from Soviet and Soviet-controlled sources.</p>
                <p>Mention has been made above as to the possible formation of an oriental bloc.
                    This is a development for the future, for there is at present a distinct lack of
                    regional cohesion in Southeast Asia. The nearest approach to such a development
                    has been the Southeast Asia League, which has had to date remarkably little
                    success. A hinted approach to such a development has been the rather nebulous
                    movement to league together Indonesia, Malaya and the four southern provinces of
                        <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0119"/>Siam—the basis for the movement
                    being the Muslim populations and the inspiration coming from Muslim leaders. The
                    foregoing would explain the overall interest of the Islamic world in the
                    emergent nations of Southeast Asia and the Islamic appeal for assistance for
                    Southeast Asia nationalism. In this connection we should endeavor to strengthen
                    our ties with the Islamic world, by which the US has been highly regarded
                    hitherto by reason of a tradition of fairness and altruism, and in such an
                    endeavor we might find it advantageous to back Turkey, an important figure in
                    the Islamic world, for one of the non-permanent seats on the Security
                    Council.</p>
                <p>In sum, our answer to Soviet anti-US propaganda should be to attack along the
                    lines indicated—our present appeal to emergent nations should be to harp
                    incessantly upon our willingness to assist them to attain national independence
                    to the extent of their capacity therefor, with our record in the Philippines
                    ever in the foreground. But we should keep in mind that it may well not be in
                    the interest of the US to contribute at this time to regionalism in national
                    movements in Southeast Asia and that it may be advantageous to play one country
                    off against another until we are certain that regionalism in Southeast Asia will
                    be oriented towards the US. Our long-range policy will naturally be guided by
                    developments in Soviet-US relations.</p>

                <p>In view its popular appeal and Communist predilection for slogans, seems to us
                    likely that “peace offensive” will be Soviet slogan. Presentation however, will
                    probably follow formula of “US-led offensive for war versus Soviet-led
                    counteroffensive for peace”. This would follow in logical sequence Soviet 1946
                    and 1947 themes of “disarmament” and “warmongering” offering opportunity to
                    contend that West had rejected disarmament, progressed to active propaganda for
                    war and had now reached stage of actual preparation and instigation of new
                    imperialist war.</p>
                <p>The “counteroffensive” of “struggle for peace” against “western” or
                    “Anglo-American imperialism” is carefully planned propaganda program which has
                    been in progress for some time, and has been gradually replacing in Soviet dogma
                    the old term “capitalist encirclement”, a conception, according to Stalin, no
                    longer possible. It appears to have <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0122"
                    />been launched in first issue of <hi rend="italic">New Times</hi> (successor to
                        <hi rend="italic">War and The Working Class</hi>) June 1, 1945, which
                    referred to struggle against enemies peoples liberties and peace and pledged
                    itself to work for “lasting peace and friendly cooperation among freedom loving
                    nations.”</p>
                <p>Although development this program has been obscured for uninitiated by usual
                    Communist double talk, real meaning of “peace offensive” was clearly revealed in
                        <hi rend="italic">Cahiers de Communisme</hi> of April 1, 1948, which
                    referred to “final victory over capitalism, or in other words the final victory
                    over war.” It has therefore become unmistakable that “peace” in Soviet lexicon
                    means destruction of capitalism and that “struggle for peace” is now synonymous
                    with promotion world revolution.</p>

                <p>On basis foregoing estimate, following is our conception of probable line of
                    verbal assault Soviet Delegation can be expected to launch in <gloss

                    as suggested above):</p>
                <p>1. US leads offensive for war in form of political, military and economic
                    actions. Political offensive is based first on organization of “blocs” directed
                    against Soviet Union and “sister democracies”, most important of which is
                    “Atlantic union” dominated by US for its aggressive aims. In addition to Western
                    Union, US attempts form other blocs which will be brought into Atlantic group or
                    will cooperate fully with it. These include Scandinavian bloc, Iberian bloc, and
                    Near East bloc, not to speak of Latin America. Second political manifestation
                    war offensive is use of occupation as instrument of aggression. US in Germany
                    and Japan seeks revival reactionary ruling groups, suppresses democratic
                    tendencies, and prevents democratization and demilitarization. Third political
                    facet is US-led imperialist oppression of colonial peoples, manifest Indonesia,

                    striking distance Soviet Union and East European “people’s democracies”;
                    military aid to and therefore control of weaker countries as Turkey, Greece,
                    Iran, China; US-British military connivance and mutual planning and preparation;

                    disarmament, reduction forces, and outlawry atomic bomb.</p>
                <p>Economic offensive for war is based on Marshall Plan as plot for enslavement

                    to West violation these agreements. Soviets fight against warmongering, support
                    “democratic” forces and endeavor destroy Fascist-militarist groups in occupied
                    areas. Soviets support “peoples liberation movements” in colonial areas. West
                    powers have twisted trusteeship into another form of capitalistic
                    oppression.</p>

                <p>Soviets will undoubtedly direct propaganda barrage principally to countries of
                    Western Europe. It will behoove US Delegation not only to meet and refute Soviet
                    arguments with fact, but itself to assume propaganda offensive and neglect no
                    opportunity to dramatize and push home West case.</p>

                    concerning military assistance programs for various nations. I agree that the
                    imminent submission of requirement estimates for France and other Western
                    European nations makes it desirable that the planning and the necessary
                    administrative steps be undertaken now in order that programs for them may be
                    implemented as speedily as possible after final approval, with the first
                    priority envisaged in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 14/1. If this can be
                    done only by giving the requirements of the Western European nations a priority
                    over the programs for the other countries named in your letter, then I agree
                    that such a priority should be given to them.</p>

                <p>Since your letter was written, you have undoubtedly received mine of August
                        9<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">Marshall’s letter of August 9 read in part as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“An over-all determination of priorities anticipating
                                inter-Departmental agreement is now in process. Pending completion
                                of this study it is my opinion that priorities for existing,
                                military assistance programs for the five countries specified in
                                your letter should be in the following order: Greece, Turkey, Iran
                                (present commitments only), China, Argentina. Present commitments to
                                Iran are understood to include the repair, packing and shipment of
                                items already declared surplus and allocated to that country.</p>
                            <p>Every effort should be made to meet the most urgent Chinese requests
                                under the 125 million dollar grants. In view of the imminent
                                completion of the Iranian program, the foregoing order of priorities
                                accords a high priority to China immediately following that of
                                Greece and Turkey. It is suggested that these high priority projects
                                may be implemented concurrently. I am told that many of the Chinese
                                requirements do not conflict with Greece and Turkey items.
                                Furthermore the progress of the campaign in Greece and season of the
                                year matériel would be delivered in Greece may warrant a decision in
                                favor of China for some items in which a dual requirement exists. In
                                cases of clear conflict with regard to <hi rend="italic"
                                    >urgently</hi> required matériel, preference should be given to
                                Greece and Turkey.</p>
                            <p>If the Secretary of Defense concurs in these priorities, they may be
                                considered as agreed upon priorities of this Government for these
                                five programs.” (800.24/7–2448)</p>

                <p>I trust that the National Military Establishment is taking the administrative

                                    practically devoid of military strength. The period of
                                    demobilization and readjustment of our own armed forces meant
                                    that their effectiveness has recently been in many respects at
                                    an abnormally low ebb. It must now be expected in Moscow that
                                    the general tendency in this country in the coming period will
                                    be toward the strengthening of our armed establishment revival
                                    of armed strength will also take place in western Europe. This

                                    Soviet leaders, against a planned continued increase in the
                                    strength of the Soviet forces, and against the stubborn Soviet
                                    conviction that a future economic crisis is sooner or later

                        are operating in such close proximity as is the case in Europe with the
                        forces of the Soviet Union and of the western powers, and particularly where
                        the fanatical and relatively unrestrained Soviet police element is so
                        strongly involved, there is always a danger of incidents which, although not
                        so intended, would lead directly to military complications.</p>
                    <p>4. Conclusion:</p>
                    <p>Weighing these various factors the evidence points to the conclusion that the
                        Soviet Government is not now planning any deliberate armed action of this
                        nature and is still seeking to achieve its aims predominantly by political
                        means, accompanied—of course—by the factor of military intimidation. The
                        tactics which it is employing, however, themselves heighten the danger that
                        military complications may arise from fortuitous causes or from
                        miscalculation. War must therefore be regarded, if not as a probability, at
                        least as a possibility, and one serious enough to be taken account of fully
                        in our military and political planning.</p>

                        way of retaliation for attacks made on Russia.</p>
                    <p>[The Soviet leaders think in political rather than military terms, and regard
                        themselves as the leaders not only of the Soviet population but of important
                        elements in western countries, particularly in the large cities and
                        industrial areas. Their basic aim is to achieve concealed political
                        domination over those areas, not to destroy them. During the last war, they
                        took little part in the air effort directed against the German population,
                        and have since tried to make political capital with the Germans out of this
                        fact. While this was probably partly a case of making virtue out of
                        necessity, the available evidence speaks for a certain political reluctance
                        on the Soviet side to resort without provocation to methods of mass
                        destruction aimed against civilian elements in other countries.]</p>
                    <p>2. If the Soviet leaders felt that there would be a strong probability of
                        retaliation, this would be an important factor in dissuading them from
                        taking the initiative in the use of the atomic weapon against western
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>[Russia has few cities to lose. Only Moscow and Leningrad could conceivably
                        house the highly centralized administrative services of the Soviet
                        Government for any length of time; and they, like all other Soviet cities,
                        are desperately over-crowded. Similarly, Soviet industry is highly

                    </p>
                    <p>There is no slack in the Soviet economic effort. A relatively small number of
                        atomic bombs could, if properly and effectively directed, set the entire
                        Soviet industrialization program back by years and have an extremely severe
                        effect on any Soviet military effort. This is not to speak of the
                        psychological effect on the Soviet people.]</p>
                    <p>3. In view of the considerations brought out in point 2, mere possession of
                        atomic weapons will not alone determine Soviet thinking. The Soviet leaders
                        will also have to take into account the head start we have enjoyed in this
                        respect, the respective raw material situations, the probable number of
                        bombs on both sides, the possibilities of delivery, etc.</p>
                    <p>4. The fact that they have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been able to dispose
                        over [<hi rend="italic">had at their disposal?</hi>] atomic weapons, whereas
                        we have, has probably been, if anything, a contributing factor in Soviet
                        intransigence in the past in matters of the international control of atomic
                        energy and possibly in other matters as well.</p>
                    <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0131"/>
                    <p>[To the Soviet mind it is unthinkable that we, enjoying this factor of
                        military superiority, are not taking it into account in our plans and
                        attempting to exploit it for political purposes. They therefore must assume
                        that our international positions, particularly in matters of the control of
                        atomic energy, are predicated on this superiority and contain a margin of
                        excessive demand, which would not be there if a better balance existed in
                        the power of disposal over the weapon. For this reason, they may actually
                        prove to be more tractable in negotiation when they have gained some measure
                        of power of disposal over the weapon, and no longer feel that they are
                        negotiating at so great a disadvantage.]</p>
                    <p>5. Conclusion:</p>
                    <p>It is not probable that the pattern of Soviet intentions as outlined above
                        would be appreciably altered in the direction of greater aggressiveness by

                    </p>
                    <p>The following are the requirements, arising from the attitudes and policies
                        of the Soviet Government, for which it is necessary that this Government
                        maintain armed strength.</p>
                    <p>1. As an indispensable background of our own political attitude with respect
                        to the U.S.S.R. In dealing with a Government so highly centralized, so
                        incorrigibly conspiratorial in its methods, so hostile traditionally towards
                        its world environment, so despotic at home, and so unpredictable in foreign
                        affairs, it is necessary that we keep ourselves in a state of unvacillating
                        mental preparedness. Without military preparedness, this would be a
                        sham.</p>
                    <p>2. As a deterrent.</p>
                    <p>This is of outstanding importance. There is no question but that if the
                        opposing strength is estimated to be so great that there would be little
                        possibility of final victory, the Russians will not deliberately resort to
                        the use of armed force. On the other hand, excessive military weakness here
                        and in western Europe might indeed create a factor which would operate to
                        overcome the other reasons why the Soviet Government would not be inclined
                        to use armed force, and might thus constitute a compelling invitation to
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p>There is no evidence that anything likely to occur in Russia within the
                        foreseeable future will in any way alter this situation. We must reckon that
                        the necessity for the maintenance of armed forces as a deterrent will
                        continue undiminished as long as the Soviet power, as we know it today,
                        continues to be dominant in Russia, and probably even longer.</p>
                    <p>3. As a source of encouragement to nations endeavoring to resist Soviet
                        political aggression.</p>
                    <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0132"/>
                    <p>The peoples who consider themselves as lying between the U.S.S.R. and the
                        U.S. and who are endeavoring to resist Soviet political pressures are
                        strongly influenced by what may be called the shadows of the armed strength
                        maintained by the two great powers. If the shadow of the Soviet armed
                        strength remains too formidable, in comparison with ours, this may well have
                        a paralyzing effect on the will to resist in western Europe and may become
                        an important factor in enabling the Russians to achieve their aims by
                        political rather than military means. It is therefore necessary for this
                        country to maintain the outward evidences of firm armed strength and
                        resolution as a means of stiffening the attitude of those peoples who would
                        like to resist Soviet political pressures.</p>
                    <p>Like the requirement of armed force as a deterrent, this requirement may be
                        expected to endure at least as long as the communist party remains the
                        dominant power in Russia. There is no reason to expect the achievement of
                        any political understanding with the Soviet leaders which could appreciably
                        offset the need for strong U.S. forces as a factor of encouragement to the
                        peoples in western Europe. This necessity is not likely to pass even with
                        the termination of the present Soviet regime.</p>
                    <p>4. As a means of (waging war successfully in case war should develop as a
                        result of an accident or miscalculation or any other cause.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to state at this time how long the relatively high degree of
                        danger implicit in the present dispositions of Soviet and western forces in
                        Europe will endure or what will be the general development of the
                        probability of planned Soviet military aggression. It is possible, but by no
                        means certain, that within two or three years the danger of military
                        complications arising from accidental causes may be reduced by changes in
                        the dispositions of armed forces in Europe. However, these is no likelihood
                        of any reduction in the general power of Soviet armed forces; on the
                        contrary, this may be expected to increase steadily in the next few years.
                        In view of the long time-lags involved in any basic alterations of a major
                        military establishment, our defense policy cannot take into account minor
                        fluctuations in the degree of danger. From the political standpoint,
                        therefore, the only safe deduction would be that for at least the next five
                        or ten years we will require such an establishment as would make it possible
                        for us to wage war successfully if it should be forced upon us. What would
                        constitute waging war “successfully” is a question which can be answered
                        only in the light of U.S. national objectives.</p>
                    <p>5. Conclusions:</p>
                    <p>None of the purposes for which we must maintain armed forces, in the light of

                            <item>From the standpoint of encouragement to peoples resisting Soviet
                                pressures, this type of defense effort would have only a limited

                                were sporadic and undependable, it might do more harm than

                            <item>From the standpoint of actual waging of war, such a defense effort
                                could conceivably have advantages only in the event that our
                                calculations as to the likely timing of Soviet military aggression
                                were correct. At present, we have no adequate means of arriving at a
                                correct calculation of such a factor. But in any case we must always
                                bear in mind that the defense effort itself would undoubtedly alter
                                the situation on which our expectancy had been based; for it would
                                probably act as an effective deterrent for that particular period
                                and we would probably not be called upon actually to use our forces
                                at the time for which we had planned their maximum strength. This
                                means that there <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0134"/>would be
                                relatively little likelihood of our forces being used for waging of
                                a war against Russia at the moment of their maximum efficiency if
                                they were shaped to meet an anticipated danger peak. We must always
                                bear in mind here the extreme flexibility and patience of Soviet
                                policy.</item>

                    <p>3. Conclusions:</p>
                    <p>In general, the factors cited above indicate that a U.S. defense policy based
                        on the maintenance of a permanent state of adequate military preparation
                        meets better the requirements of the situation, insofar as these arise out
                        of Soviet policies and attitudes, than a defense effort pointed toward a
                        given estimated peak of war danger.</p>

                                    dealing with United States policy on atomic warfare. The
                                    conclusions are on the last page of this paper.</p>

                        <p>According to <hi rend="italic">The Forrestal Diaries</hi>, the Secretary
                            of Defense discussed the possible use of atomic weapons in the event of
                            war with Marshall, Royall, and General Omar N. Bradley, Chief of Staff,
                            United States Army, on July 28 (Millis, pp. 461–462). Forrestal also
                            raised the question with the Secretary of State at the conclusion of the
                            Cabinet meeting of September 10. Marshall suggested a meeting with
                            President Truman on September 13. That White House conference was
                            attended by the President; Forrestal; Royall; General Bradley; and
                            General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Air Force Chief of Staff. President Truman
                            received “the same presentation that Vandenberg made to the Secretary of
                            State last week . . . .”on the subject of use of atomic weapons in an
                            emergency. No record of Marshall’s briefing by General Vandenberg has
                            been found in the files of the Department of State. Forrestal recalls
                            that “the President said that he prayed that he would never have to make
                            such a decision, but that if it became necessary, no one need have a
                            misgiving but that he would do so . . . .” (Millis, p. 487)</p>

                            Executive Secretariat of the Department of State, September 14, read as

                <p>1. To determine the advisability of formulating, at this time, policies regarding
                    the use of atomic weapons.</p>

                <p>2. The decision to employ atomic weapons is a decision of highest policy. The
                    circumstances prevailing when war is joined cannot be <pb n="626"
                        xml:id="pg_626" facs="0136"/>wholly forecast with any greater certainty than
                    can the arrival of war. It appears imprudent either to prescribe or to prohibit
                    beforehand the use of any particular weapons when the character of future
                    conflict is subject only to imperfect prediction. In this circumstance, a
                    prescription preceding diagnosis could invite disaster.</p>
                <p>3. If war itself cannot be prevented, it appears futile to hope or to suggest
                    that the imposition of limitations on the use of certain military weapons can
                    prevent their use in war.</p>
                <p>4. The United States has nothing presently to gain, commensurable with the risk
                    of raising the question, in either a well-defined or an equivocal decision that
                    atomic weapons would be used in the event of war. An advance decision that
                    atomic weapons <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be used, if necessary, would
                    presumably be of some use to the military planners. Such a decision does not
                    appear essential, however, since the military can and will, in its absence, plan
                    to exploit every capability in the form of men, materials, resources and science
                    this country has to offer.</p>
                <p>5. In this matter, public opinion must be recognized as a factor of considerable
                    importance. Deliberation or decision on a subject of this significance, even if
                    clearly affirmative, might have the effect of placing before the American people
                    a moral question of vital security significance at a time when the full security
                    impact of the question had not become apparent. If this decision is to be made
                    by the American people, it should be made in the circumstances of an actual
                    emergency when the principal factors involved are in the forefront of public
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>6. Foreign opinion likewise demands consideration. Official discussion respecting
                    the use of atomic weapons would reach the Soviets, who should in fact never be
                    given the slightest reason to believe that the U.S. would even consider not to
                    use atomic weapons against them if necessary. It might take no more than a
                    suggestion of such consideration, perhaps magnified into a doubt, were it
                    planted in the minds of responsible Soviet officials, to provoke exactly that
                    Soviet aggression which it is fundamentally U.S. policy to avert.</p>
                <p>7. If Western Europe is to enjoy any feeling of security at the present time,
                    without which there can be no European economic recovery and little hope for a
                    future peaceful and stable world, it is in large degree because the atomic bomb,
                    under American trusteeship, offers the present major counterbalance to the
                    ever-present threat of the Soviet military power. This was recognized by the
                    then Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes, who, in an address before the United
                    Nations General Assembly on December 13, 1946, acknowledged, with the applause
                    of the Assembly, that: “In the recent past, the concern of peace-loving nations
                    has not been that America maintained excessive armaments. The concern has been
                    that America failed to maintain <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0137"
                    />adequate armaments to guard the peace. … It was our military weakness, not our
                    military strength, that encouraged Axis aggression.”<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2"

                    States to decide against, or publicly debate the issue of the use of the atomic
                    bomb on moral grounds, this country might gain the praise of the world’s radical
                    fringe and would certainly receive the applause of the Soviet bloc, but the
                    United States would be thoroughly condemned by every sound citizen in Western
                    Europe, whose enfeebled security this country would obviously be
                    threatening.</p>
                <p>8. Furthermore, consideration must be given to whether any public unilateral
                    decision respecting the use of atomic weapons should be made when the
                    international control of atomic energy is subject to debate within the United
                    Nations. In the “General Conclusions and Recommendations” of the <hi

                            way for international cooperation in broader fields, for the control of

                            that agreement on effective measures for the control of atomic energy is
                            itself dependent on <hi rend="underline">cooperation in broader</hi>

                <p>9. International cooperation in “broader fields of policy” has been woefully and
                    dangerously lacking on the part of the Soviet Union and its satellites. Any
                    attempt now or in the future under these circumstances, to prohibit or
                    negatively to qualify the employment of atomic bombs could result
                    catastrophically. The measure of success achieved by the United States in
                    collaboration with other nations in the establishment of an effective system of
                    international control of atomic energy <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0138"
                    />should directly determine the measure of control the United States will impose
                    upon itself in the employment of atomic weapons. Until international agreement
                    can be reached on an acceptable plan to control atomic energy (only the Soviet
                    Union, Poland and the Ukrainian S.S.R. have blocked the attainment of this
                    goal), it is dangerously delusive to consider the self-imposition of any
                    unilateral qualifications of the use of atomic weapons.</p>
                <p>10. The United States has offered, along with all other nations, to eliminate
                    atomic weapons from national armaments if and when a fully effective,
                    enforceable system of international control is put into effect. In the meantime
                    United States policy should ensure that no commitment be made in the absence of
                    an established and acceptable system of international control of atomic energy
                    which would deny this country the right to employ such weapons in the event of
                    actual hostilities. The actual decision to employ weapons should be made by the
                    Chief Executive and in the light of prevailing circumstances.</p>
                <p>11. The time and circumstances under which atomic weapons might be employed are
                    incapable of accurate determination prior to the evident imminence of
                    hostilities. The type and character of targets against which atomic weapons
                    might be used is primarily a function of military selection in the preparation
                    and planning of grand strategy. In this case, however, there is the additional
                    requirement for blending a political with a military responsibility in order to
                    assure that the conduct of war, to the maximum extent practicable, advances the
                    fundamental and lasting aims of U.S. policy.</p>

                <p>12. It is recognized that, in the event of hostilities, the National Military
                    Establishment must be ready to utilize promptly and effectively all appropriate
                    means available, including atomic weapons, in the interest of national security
                    and must therefore plan accordingly.</p>
                <p>13. The decision as to the employment of atomic weapons in the event of war is to
                    be made by the Chief Executive when he considers such decision to be
                    required.</p>

                <p>The conclusion of this paper that no action should now be taken to obtain a
                    decision whether or not to use atomic weapons in any possible future conflict
                    appears to be completely sound. I also agree that we should not now attempt to
                    reach a final decision as to the time and circumstances under which atomic
                    weapons might or might not be employed. It seems to me, however, that it would
                    be extremely useful at least to study the pros and cons involved and to have
                    information readily available upon which to base immediate recommendations to
                    the President in the event of war. The following considerations seem pertinent: <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>I understand it is the contention of the Air Forces that if such
                            weapons are to be employed it is almost essential that they be used in
                            the opening stages of any conflict. Clearly, we need now only to
                            consider the Soviet Union as a potential enemy. If in the event of war
                            the enemy is given time to perfect his fighter defense and radar nets
                            atomic bombing operations will be made more difficult. Even more
                            important some of our best air bases might be overrun or captured by Air
                            Borne troops. In these circumstances, unless there is much advanced
                            planning, there appears to be danger that a decision might be taken by
                            the President or the Cabinet on a very few hours’ notice without full
                            consideration of all the factors involved, as the pressure would
                            undoubtedly be very great.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Not only military planning is involved in this decision. Plans for
                            psychological warfare should be worked out to cover both alternatives.
                            In the event of war, the Russians would certainly again take up the
                            radio sets of their citizens. We might, however, have a few hours or
                            even days before such action could be completed and it would be
                            essential that we take advantage of this period to inform the Russian
                            and satellite peoples of our policy with respect to atomic
                            warfare.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>While it is clear that there should be no public debate on this matter
                            at this time, I see no reason why plans should not be carried out for
                            the use of atomic weapons, in the event such a decision were made, and I
                            believe careful study should be prepared of the advantages and
                            disadvantages of their use. For the reason set forth in the <gloss

                                facs="0140"/>however, such studies should be handled on a top secret
                            basis by as limited a group as possible. Such a group however should
                            contain persons competent to judge psychological reactions of the
                            Russian people.</item>

                <p>From the point of view of psychological warfare, I concur fully in the views of

                        >NSC</gloss>/30 paper. I might add that public opinion in the United States
                    may have an important bearing on the question and might force the use of atomic
                    weapons, even if the chief executive were inclined against it. The public would
                    refuse to accept American casualties which might be saved by shortening the
                    war.</p>

                    U.S. Policy on Atomic Warfare</p>
                <p>This paper reached <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> only a few hours before the
                    deadline set for receiving recommendations and comments. I have therefore been
                    able to give the paper only a brief and cursory examination.</p>
                <p>The paper poses the problem whether at this time we should determine policies
                    regarding the use of atomic weapons. The conclusions reached are that full
                    preparation should be made for the prompt utilization of atomic weapons but that
                    no action should be taken now to obtain a decision either to use or not to use
                    atomic weapons or as to the time and circumstances governing possible use of
                    such weapons.</p>
                <p>While apparently taking no decision on the question whether or not atomic weapons
                    should be used, as a practical matter the paper would in large part foreclose
                    the issue. The National Military Establishment, in making its plans, will have
                    to proceed on the basis that atomic weapons are to be used. If war of major
                    proportions breaks out, the Military Establishment will have little alternative
                    but to recommend <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0141"/>to the Chief Executive
                    that atomic weapons be used, and he will have no alternative but to go along.
                    Thus, in effect, the paper actually decides the issue.</p>
                <p>To my mind, the question to be decided is not whether we should or should not use
                    atomic weapons, for in the absence of any internationally-accepted system of
                    supervision and control of such weapons we must assume that they will be used.
                    The question is rather when and how such weapons should be used. Should we, for
                    example, in the event of war, begin by bombing major centers of population in
                    enemy territory or start with smaller centers important for transportation or
                    specific industries? This question should be answered not so much on the basis
                    of humanitarian principles as from a practical weighing of the long-run
                    advantage to this country. Depending upon conditions in the enemy country, the
                    bombing of major population centers or centers having special sentimental
                    significance might mobilize popular sentiment for resistance in a manner to
                    prolong the war. Similarly, should we bomb the territory of enemy
                    allies—especially unwilling enemy allies—and territory occupied by the
                    enemy?</p>
                <p>A suggestion that political as well as strategic issues may be involved is
                    contained in the last sentence of paragraph 11. I wonder if it would not be
                    helpful to our National Military Establishment if this thought were more fully
                    developed and guide lines—if any are possible—laid out for aid in strategic
                    planning.</p>

                    interchange of information with Britain and Canada.</p>
                <p>I attended as you requested the meeting in Secretary Symington’s office at 10:30
                    this morning concerning the handling of technological exchanges with the British
                    and Canadians.</p>
                <p>The first part of the meeting was taken up with the discussion between Dr.
                        Bush<note n="1" xml:id="d46fn1">Vannevar Bush, Chairman of the Research and
                        Development Board.</note> and the Service representatives from which it
                    developed that Bush was very dissatisfied with the way the present set-up was
                    looking and he said there was considerable irritation on the part of his
                    opposite members in Great Britain and Canada. He read a despatch from the
                    Embassy in London in which the British head of their Scientific Research and
                    Development Board complained <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0142"/>at the way
                    the system is working. The Service Departments maintained the opposite and
                    emphasized the security aspect. The Service Departments proposed that the
                    present <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss> set-up<note n="2"
                        xml:id="d46fn2">Reference is to the State–Army–Navy–Air Force Coordinating
                        Committee’s Subcommittee for Information Control (<gloss target="#t_MIC1"
                            >MIC</gloss>).</note> should be maintained with the addition of a
                    representative from the <gloss target="#t_NRDB1">NRDB</gloss>, but Dr. Bush said
                    he did not think that would be satisfactory, and said he did not quite see why
                    State was especially interested since the policy was clear and it was only the
                    implementation he had in mind.</p>
                <p>I pointed out that while we were in favor of a liberal policy in regard to
                    exchange for the general reason involving relations with the British and
                    Canadians, we were of course not competent to decide on the degree of security
                    risk involved in any given process for information; that that was a matter for
                    the Service Departments to pass upon. However, I said I thought that there was
                    the element of what might be called “political security” involved in the various
                    countries concerned and that this sometimes varied depending upon what branches
                    of a foreign government did receive classified technological information, citing
                    in this case the matter of the jet planes<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">Reference
                        is to the possible sale of jet aircraft and engines by the United Kingdom to
                        the Soviet Union.</note> and the difference between the War Office and the
                    Admiralty on the one hand, and the civilian ministers of supply and aircraft
                    production on the other. I further pointed out that the political relations of
                    the receiving country such as Great Britain with other European countries had to
                    be taken into consideration. I also pointed out that these matters were under
                    constant change as the political situation altered abroad and that, therefore,
                    the implementation of these policies should be kept under constant review in
                    connection with the considerations I had mentioned.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bush said he had not thought of that aspect of the matter and was impressed
                    by it. He thereupon abandoned his original position that State should not be
                    represented on the Committee to handle implementation and in effect agreed that
                    some modification of the present <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss>
                    set-up to include NEDB representation should be satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The meeting thus ended in agreement and Mr. Ohly<note n="4" xml:id="d46fn4">John
                        H. Ohly, Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense.</note> was asked to
                    work out the necessary changes in present <gloss target="#t_SANACC1"
                        >SANACC</gloss> procedure on this subject to take care of Dr. Bush’s desire
                    as modified and to submit them to the interested Departments for
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>I therefore imagine you will be receiving very shortly recommendations for this
                    revised <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss> procedure.</p>

                        <p>“The work of the Session in the political field was conditioned largely
                            by the continuing differences between the Soviet Union and the other
                            Members. In all the important political questions considered except that
                            of Palestine, i.e. the questions of atomic energy, the reduction and
                            regulation of conventional armaments, Greece, Korea, the veto,
                            membership in the United Nations, and the Interim Committee, the issues
                            were sharply drawn between Soviet and non-Soviet views. Consideration of
                            these questions—particularly those of atomic energy, reduction of
                            conventional armaments, and the Greek question—led to debates on foreign
                            policies generally and on the broad issues separating the Soviet Union
                            from other countries.</p>

                            Assembly debates and in the Berlin case, which was then under
                            consideration by the Security Council. A resolution proposed by Mexico,
                            calling upon the major allied powers to compose their differences and to
                            reach as quickly as possible the agreements necessary to liquidate the
                            results of the war and establish peace, was adopted by the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Webb</hi>: This refers to your letter of August
                    10, 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d48fn1">Not printed.</note> in which you stated
                    that the Bureau of the Budget is prepared to consider requests for care and
                    handling allocations, supported by the necessary justifications, for the Iranian
                    program.</p>
                <p>Your letter also referred to the general problem of treatment of foreign military
                    assistance programs, particularly in connection with the basic factor of
                    availabilities in the light of our own expanded military program, and enclosed a
                    copy of your letter of the same date to the Secretary of Defense,<note n="1"
                        xml:id="d48fn9">Not printed.</note> which noted the question of priorities
                    as between foreign nations and as between our own and foreign requirements,
                    recognizing that strategic and foreign policy considerations are involved, and
                    suggested several type questions pertinent to an examination of the subject of
                    availabilities.</p>
                <p>I am in complete agreement that the solution of foreign military assistance
                    problems should be undertaken from the overall viewpoint, with the connotations
                    emphasized in your letter. The necessity for balancing availabilities with
                    strategic and national policy considerations has guided the formulation of
                    Department of State policies in these matters, and has been stressed in
                    discussions with the Departments of the National Military Establishment
                    concerning projects for military aid abroad.</p>

                <p>Your letter notes the importance of availability studies. It has been brought to
                    my attention that under Army directives of last April and May (letter AGO,
                    Subject: Disposition of Excess Supplies and Return of Supplies to the Zone of
                    Interior, dated 22 April 1948, and letter, Chief of Ordnance, Subject: Ordnance
                    Items Required in the Zone of the Interior, dated 7 May 1948) effective measures
                    have been taken to secure up-to-date data on the location and availabilities of
                    Army ordnance stocks. I am informed that these directives were issued with a
                    view to auditing and supplying our own needs and to determining, in some measure
                    at least, availabilities for foreign requirements.</p>
                <p>In June, 1948, a regular procedure was established in this Department covering
                    policy determination in cases of foreign military assistance proposals, and
                    providing for coordination with the services in the implementation of approved
                    projects. The views of the services were and are invariably secured and
                    thoroughly considered with reference to policy advisability in each
                    instance.</p>
                <p>The concerned offices of this Department and of the National Military
                    Establishment are now studying the procedural requirements involved, in the
                    light of experience with military assistance proposals to date, and appear to be
                    in general preliminary agreement, both as to policy factors and as to
                    implementation of approved projects by an inter-departmental executive
                    group.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Admiral Souers</hi>: During the past several
                        months, considerable effort has been devoted to determining the best means
                        of securing integrated basic security resources assumptions for mobilization
                        planning in the politico-military and in the domestic and foreign economic
                        fields. Such basic security resources assumptions constitute a prerequisite
                        for the National Security Resources Board’s mobilization planning. Urgency
                        in this matter stems from the generally accepted assumption that there will
                        be a continuation of the present uncertainties of neither war nor peace, and
                        war with the USSR, if not a probability, is a definite risk. Predicated upon
                        such an assumption, this Board is currently engaged in the preparation of an
                        Emergency Mobilization Plan for 1949, to be completed by December of this
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The broad comprehensive judgment and knowledge essential to the preparation
                        of integrated assumptions with their complex and interrelated facets, does
                        not appear to be within the capabilities of any single governmental agency.
                        However, using the competence of all appropriate agencies, under carefully
                        conceived sponsorship and monitorship, I believe the assembling of basic
                        security resources assumptions can be accomplished and should be attempted.
                        It must, however, be a continuing operation subject to periodic review and
                            <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0148"/>revision and closely attuned to
                        the constantly changing pattern of national and international events.</p>
                    <p>In exploring the means of best formulating basic security resources
                        assumptions, there have been informal discussions with several of the
                        agencies concerned. As a result of these discussions, the attached outlines
                        have been developed on the basis that: The National Security Council could
                        monitor the politico-military assumptions; the National Security Resources
                        Board could monitor the economic assumptions; and, the National Security
                        Council could provide the overall sponsorship and monitorship required for
                        integration.</p>
                    <p>Formulation of assumptions within the exact framework of the enclosed
                        outlines is neither intended nor implied. These outlines have been developed
                        only as a tentative framework, within which assumptions would be valuable.
                        Amplification, supporting comment, and elaboration are believed essential.
                        It is particularly desirable for mobilization planning purposes that U.S.
                        objectives or positions, where appropriate, and known facts and estimated
                        factors in the various fields, be clearly stated as a point of departure for
                        assumptions.</p>
                    <p>Actually, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 20 series will provide the
                        basis for many of the answers required. Also, the rently completed Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff strategic plan—part of which has been made available to
                        me—should be helpful in providing a basis for answers in the military field.
                        This Board, with the assistance of the several departments represented
                        thereon, together with the Council of Economic Advisers, the Economic
                        Cooperation Administration, and the Bureau of the Budget, can provide the
                        domestic and foreign economic portions of the outlines.</p>
                    <p>I therefore propose that the National Security Council assume the
                        responsibility for developing integrated basic security resources
                        assumptions and that after their development, the President be advised of
                        their contents and informed that they will be subject to periodic review and
                        revision.</p>

                <p>The matter has been given careful consideration by the political and research
                    divisions dealing with the areas mentioned and the memorandum enclosed with this

                <p>Although treated in more detail, the analysis of Soviet policy in the enclosed
                    memorandum corresponds in general to that contained in the telegrams of the
                    Embassy at Moscow referred to above. The major point of difference concerns
                    opinion as to whether or not Soviet policy envisages active support of the
                    Chinese Communists in attaining their object of domination of all China in the
                    face of the risk that a Communist regime in China might present a “Tito”<note

                                rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>, pp. 1054</ref> ff.</note> As a corollary,
                    the question arises as to whether or not the Soviets might be reluctant to
                    foster the expansion of Chinese Communist influence in Southeast Asia for the
                    same reason. In brief, although citing the risk, the Embassy in Moscow feels
                    that active support of the Chinese Communists along these lines is still a
                    cardinal factor in Soviet policy, whereas the Department is inclined to give
                    more weight to the disturbing effect of Tito’s recalcitrance to the confidence
                    of the Soviet leaders in their ability to control a Communist regime ruling all
                    China.</p>
                <p>A factor favoring the U.S.S.R. not mentioned by the Embassy in Moscow is the
                    potential exploitation by the Soviets of their domination of areas in Northeast

                    run.</p>
                <p>The attached memorandum should be useful (<hi rend="italic">to London only</hi>)
                    as background material for discussion of this subject with appropriate officials

                    the area and to restrict the advance of the other and in so doing to take

                    <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The defeat of Japan and the elimination of the threat of Japanese aggression from
                    Northeast Asia together with the postwar territorial gains and special
                    privileges secured by the USSR in this area would be considered by Moscow as at
                    best a partial victory if Japan were to re-emerge as a strong power with or
                    without the backing of any third power. To counteract this possibility the
                    Soviet Union will continue its attempts not only to strengthen the Soviet Far
                    East but to increase its influence and control in the adjacent areas of
                    Manchuria and Korea as well as the penetration of Japan itself by means of the
                    Communist <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0151"/>Party. But so long as the US
                    exercises control of Japan, the USSR is largely restricted to the employment of
                    only such indirect measures as the encouragement of left-wing elements in Japan,
                    the indoctrination of Soviet-held Japanese prisoners of war, the development of
                    Soviet-Japanese cultural relations, and the limited restrictive powers available
                    through Soviet participation in the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied
                    Council. Soviet propaganda will continue its endeavors to exploit among other
                    Asiatic nations fears of renewed Japanese aggression and economic competition in
                    the hope thereby to enlist support for its attacks on American occupation
                    policy.</p>
                <p>The USSR would like to see the American-dominated occupation of Japan brought to
                    an early conclusion but probably would not be party to any peace settlement
                    which left the US in an overly advantageous position in Japan. Furthermore, the
                    Soviets may find it to their advantage to remain outside any peace settlement
                    for, by so doing, it could retain a belligerent status with Japan, postponing
                    indefinitely the implementation of certain provisions of the Sino-Soviet treaty
                    on Dairen, Port Arthur and the Chinese Changchun railway; exploit differences
                    among the Allies on post-treaty control of Japan; and refuse to cooperate with
                    any action taken by the future control authority over Japan.</p>
                <p>The interest that the USSR has already evinced in trade with Japan assumes added
                    importance from the fact that Manchuria, North China, and Korea, upon which
                    Japan formerly depended for much of its trade, are likely to come under indirect
                    Soviet control. This situation might enable the USSR to tie Japan economically
                    to the Soviet Far East, a development that would have obvious political
                    implications.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Korea</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In view of Korea’s strategic value to the USSR, Moscow will be extremely
                    reluctant to withdraw until satisfied that Korea will be united under a
                    government with an attitude fundamentally friendly toward the Soviet Union.
                    Hence, the USSR will continue to resist all efforts to unite Korea on any but a
                    pro-Soviet basis and if necessary will not hesitate to recognize its North
                    Korean puppet regime or to continue its occupation in some form or other in
                    order to keep the northern zone within the Soviet sphere. The USSR may hope that
                    in the event of American troop withdrawal from South Korea, the superior
                    organization and military strength of the northern regime plus Communist
                    domination of adjacent Manchuria and the proximity of the Soviet Union proper
                    will eventually force South Korea, however reluctantly, into the Soviet orbit.
                    For this reason, Moscow will continue to advocate an immediate withdrawal of all
                    occupation forces.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Soviet policy in China is directed against the emergence of a strong, unified
                    China—particularly if such a China were not Communist-dominated—and toward the
                    establishment of Soviet hegemony in Manchuria and Sinkiang, and possibly Inner
                    Mongolia and the extension of Soviet influence throughout China through the
                    medium of the Chinese Communist Party. So long as the present civil war
                    continues and the Chinese National Government has little prospect of victory,
                    the USSR can afford to continue its policy of “non-intervention” in Chinese
                    affairs. Should the present balance of forces in China swing in favor of the
                    National Government, the USSR would probably attempt to furnish sufficient
                    support to the Chinese Communists to redress that balance. Should the Chinese
                    Communist forces assume a decisive ascendancy in the civil war and move through
                    their own efforts toward the control of all China, the minimum general aims of
                    the USSR vis-à-vis China would seem to be fulfilled in as much as the Chinese
                    Communists would be expected to take no action or adopt no policy in the
                    international field which would be contrary to Soviet interests. The USSR may be
                    expected to continue its efforts towards encouragement of movements directed
                    toward the separation from Chinese control of peripheral areas, such as Sinkiang
                    and Inner Mongolia. Failure of the Chinese Communists to oppose or at least take
                    a stand against such Soviet encroachments would be harmful to the Chinese
                    Communist movement in China in view of the strength of the forces of nationalism
                    in China and this circumstance might serve to slacken the pace of Soviet efforts
                    to detach peripheral areas from a Communist-dominated China. Although the Soviet
                    position in Manchuria is legally assured through the provisions of the
                    Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, which give to the USSR the use of Port Arthur
                    as a naval base, special rights in Dairen and joint administration with China of
                    the main trunk railway lines, ultimate Soviet objectives in Manchuria probably
                    look toward the establishment of a Communist regime which will be, in fact,
                    answerable to Moscow and not to a national government of China, even though it
                    is Communist-dominated. However the Chinese Communists may regard the Soviet
                    legal position in Manchuria, they may be expected to accept it and justify it by
                    pointing to the Yalta Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty, in neither of which
                    they participated. Recent Soviet interest in mediation of the civil war in China
                    probably arises from a belief that such mediation constitutes, under present
                    conditions, the most effective means for advancing the cause of the Chinese
                    Communist Party and at the same time embarrassing the United States. Probably
                    the USSR and the CCP reason that, in view of the greatly weakened bargaining
                    position of the present National Government, mediation <pb n="643"
                        xml:id="pg_643" facs="0153"/>by the USSR would secure to the Chinese
                    Communists a dominant position which could later be exploited by proven
                    Communist methods to eliminate opposition: It is possible, however, that Soviet
                    overtures with respect to mediation arise from a desire to preserve some kind of
                    balance in China and thus prevent the emergence of a unified nation. In this the
                    Soviets may be governed by a fear of increasing National Government strength
                    resulting from the U.S. aid program or, conversely, by apprehension that the
                    Chinese Communists might become sufficiently strong to emulate Tito in defying
                    Moscow’s authority.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Southeast Asia</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Soviet policy in the various countries of Southeast Asia has but a single goal,
                    to substitute the influence of the USSR for that of the western powers in such
                    manner and degree as to ensure Soviet control being as surely installed and
                    predominate as in the satellite countries behind the Iron Curtain. That policy
                    is manifested in both covert and overt activity and its implementation is along
                    definite lines: (1) weakening of the ties between areas which now are or
                    recently were colonies and their metropolitan powers through the encouragement
                    of nationalism and by capitalizing on the discontent caused by long periods of
                    “colonial oppression,” and (2) disrupting the economy of the areas still under
                    colonial control by armed action or by labor disorders so that the metropolitan
                    powers will be deprived of revenue and resources and the USSR will be able to
                    fish profitably in the troubled waters of economic chaos.</p>
                <p>In logical sequence the Soviet policy is formulated to encourage nationalist
                    aspirations by overlooking no opportunity to denounce the western powers as
                    exploiters of native peoples, to lessen the ability of the western powers to
                    resist realization of those aspirations by making the cost in Southeast Asia and
                    at home too great a price, and to seize control of the nationalist movements by
                    organized militant methods which include eventual elimination of truly
                    nationalist leaders. In all this, up to the final denouement, Moscow will move
                    with circumspection in order to prevent any awakening of latent suspicions as to
                    its motives.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, implementation has been chiefly by indirection and Moscow appears to
                    have relied almost exclusively upon Chinese Communist guidance of Southeast
                    Asian Communist movements. In this Moscow was assisted by the fact that large
                    Chinese communities exist in every country of Southeast Asia and that a
                    substantial number of these Chinese are Communists and, more fortuitously for
                    Moscow, in control of influential labor unions. The nationalist movement in
                    Indochina is led by Communists who appear to be steadily consolidating their
                    control due to the French failure to satisfy the basic demands <pb n="644"
                        xml:id="pg_644" facs="0154"/>of the Vietnamese people. The military power of
                    the elements resisting the French has steadily improved over the past three
                    years. In Indonesia, a Communist offensive has recently been launched.
                    Strengthened by amalgamation with other left-wing parties, the Communists under
                    Muso (an Indonesian recently returned from Moscow) have seized control of the
                    city of Madiun, in central Java, and declared the formation of a Soviet
                    Government. Communist-inspired outbreaks have also taken place in Surakarta,
                    also in central Java, and reportedly in some areas of Sumatra. The Republican
                    Government has announced that it will take all steps to restore its
                    authority.</p>
                <p>But Moscow could not permit direction by indirection to continue indefinitely and
                    the recently established Soviet Legation in Bangkok, with numerous Russian
                    personnel, is undoubtedly taking an increasingly greater part of the direction
                    of Soviet policy implementation into its own capable hands. Through direct
                    contact Moscow probably hopes to bring about greater control of the Communist
                    elements in the countries of Southeast Asia and to create new diplomatic and
                    trade relations, all of which will provide channels of typical Communist
                    infiltration.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: As you know, we have been
                    engaged for a number of months in the preparation of a statement of forces on
                    which to base a military budget for fiscal 1950.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">In

                </p>
                <p>At the risk of over-simplification, I would say that we have two basic problems
                    with respect to the size of the military establishment: One is the problem with
                    which the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been dealing—namely, ascertaining the
                    forces which we need in order to combat possible acts of aggression. Over and
                    above this—and of greater importance in my opinion—is the problem with which you
                    are concerned—namely, that we maintain sufficient strength to assist you in your
                    difficult international negotiations, in order that peace may be maintained.</p>
                <p>As you know, last spring the President set a limit of fifteen billion dollars as
                    the tentative ceiling for the military budget for fiscal 1950.<note n="3"
                        xml:id="d52fn3">For an account of the White House meeting of May 13, 1948,
                        at which the President announced the $15 billion ceiling, see <hi
                            rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 435–438.</note>
                    <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0155"/>In point of fact, the ceiling is
                    actually 14.4 billion because of the practice of charging funds for stockpiling
                    against the military ceiling—and the stockpiling appropriation for the
                    forthcoming fiscal year is on the order of six hundred million dollars.</p>
                <p>You are, of course, familiar with the international background when this decision
                    of last spring was reached. You will recall that you and I and the Secretary of
                    the Treasury talked over the matter with the President, and at that time you
                    made the statement that our plans should be predicated on the assumption that we
                    were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> preparing for a state of war.</p>
                <p>I think it is important to note that the ceiling of 14.4 billion will not be
                    adequate to maintain the level of forces which we are scheduled to attain at the
                    end of the current fiscal year. I am attaching a memorandum which gives the
                    strengths previously planned for the current year—and some examples of the
                    strength reductions that will flow from a 14.4 budget.</p>
                <p>What I should like to have from you is your judgment on the following matters: <list>
                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                        <item>Has there been an improvement in the international picture which would
                            warrant a substantial reduction in the military forces we had planned to

                <p>On 10 July 1948, I addressed a letter to the National Security Council asking for

                    on the budget strengths that should be maintained.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">

                    precise language is not an easy one to draft. I do feel, however, that I must
                    seek every avenue of judgment to supplement my own.</p>
                <p>My reason for all of the foregoing can be summed up as follows:</p>
                <p>In addition to submitting a budget within the President’s tentative ceiling of
                    14.4 billion, I feel an obligation to inform him of the weakening of our
                    strength which this budget entails, in the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff—and I am also considering sending the President, as my own recommendation,
                    a proposal that he lift the ceiling to approximately 17½ billion—which, in my
                    opinion, while involving some risks, would provide us with forces capable of
                    taking effective action in the event of trouble.</p>

                    <p>In view of the present world situation it was decided on 14 October that the
                        final determination as to the forces that should be maintained during fiscal
                        year 1950 would be made at the latest practicable date that would still
                        permit development and inclusion of the necessary budget data in the
                        budgetary program of the President for the coming year. There was made
                        public as a result of the hearings before the committees of the Congress
                        last spring on the subject of selective service and the supplemental
                        appropriation request required to support the program for augmentation of
                        the military forces, the fact that funds were being provided which would
                        provide year end (30 June 1949) strengths of 790,000 for the Army, 474,000
                        for the Navy, 92,000 for the Marines, and 446,500 for the Air
                        Force—organized into 66 Groups. If the program for fiscal year 1949 were
                        fully implemented, the total military personnel at June 30, 1949, would
                        total 1,803,500, and <hi rend="italic">in addition</hi> 161,000 one-year
                        trainees—or an overall total of 1,964,500.</p>
                    <p>The tentative fiscal limitation for the National Military Establishment,
                        exclusive of such items as stockpiling of critical materials, is $14.4
                        billion. Present estimates indicate that within this limitation an aggregate
                        strength of about 1,625,000 <hi rend="italic">including</hi> one-year
                        trainees could be maintained during fiscal year 1950. For purposes of
                        comparison the military personnel and support that could be allocated to the
                        Air Force within the 14.4 budget would provide for about 51 Groups as
                        compared with a present program calling for 66 Groups at the end of fiscal
                        year 1949.</p>
                    <p>Our present estimates are that to construct forces with a capability of
                        effective reaction immediately at the outset of a war would require military
                        personnel for the three services approximating 1,975,000, <hi rend="italic"
                            >including</hi> one-year trainees. Again for purposes of comparison the
                        personnel and funds and support under these estimates would provide for a 70
                        Group Air Force with comparable relative readiness on the part of the other
                        forces. Cost of this program for fiscal year 1950 would approximate $21
                        billion. Specifically, these estimates are based upon a war plan which—in
                        the event of hostilities—would contemplate <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647"
                            facs="0157"/>securing of the Mediterranean line of communications and
                        the use by us, in conjunction with our allies, of the Cairo-Suez area.</p>
                    <p>At present we are attempting to develop and evaluate a strategic concept
                        which could be implemented with forces between the lesser strengths and the
                        greater strengths indicated above. The tentative fiscal limitation we are
                        using as a target for this intermediate force comes to approximately $17.5
                        billion. The aggregate forces under this intermediate target approximate the
                        year and strengths previously planned for the current fiscal year.</p>

                <p>On Sunday, 31 October, Forrestal called me for the purpose of discussing his
                    budget problem.<note n="1" xml:id="d53fn1">For Forrestal’s account of the
                        discussion, see Millis, <hi rend="italic">The Forrestal Diaries</hi>, p.
                        511.</note> He said that he and the military leaders had consulted General
                    Marshall regarding the tentative top limit put on the military budget for the
                    fiscal year 1950 since he felt that the 15 billion dollar figure (he referred to
                    it as 14.4 billions actually, available) would be too small to permit the
                    development of defensive forces agreed on last spring. He was aiming to have
                    those ready by July 1, 1949.</p>
                <p>Without going too much into the detail, Forrestal said that one of the
                    complications in arriving at a decision was the degree of importance attached to
                    an adequate military establishment in connection with our present foreign policy
                    and the negotiations now taking place.</p>
                <p>I told him that that was obviously a very difficult question and that it was not
                    my understanding that the State Department should be put in a position of
                    expressing judgment on the size of the defense forces which this country needed
                    for its national security. I referred to this topic, which I had discussed at
                    lunch with him on 26 October, and he agreed that his questions to you should not
                    be so much on the size of the budget or the amount of military strength needed,
                    but rather should be requests for an opinion as to whether or not the
                    international situation was static or deteriorating as compared with the
                    conclusions reached last spring.</p>
                <p>He said he was writing a letter to you enclosing a memorandum and raising several
                    questions along the line mentioned just above and that the most important one
                    related to whether or not matters had gotten sufficiently better internationally
                    to permit a reduction in the military <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0158"
                    />forces previously planned as being ready by the middle of next year.<note
                        n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">The letter and memorandum are printed <hi
                            rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                    </note>
                </p>
                <p>He said he had to start talks with the Budget on November 8 and that he realized
                    the time was very short to get an indication of your views. In these
                    circumstances he asked if I would make a guess as to the answer to the principal
                    question. I told him that my opinion would be of little value but that, if he
                    wanted a personal estimate pending receipt of word from you, I would guess that
                    the situation was not changed much since the spring and certainly I could see no
                    substantial improvement in the world situation, particularly in the light of the
                    Stalin speech<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">Reference is presumably to the
                        interview published by <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on October 28 in which
                        Stalin was highly critical of Western policy with respect to Berlin; for
                        documentation on United States policy regarding the Berlin crisis, see <ref
                            target="frus1948v02#pg_867">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, pp.
                            867</ref> ff.</note> and the growing complications in the Middle
                    East.</p>
                <p>I also suggested that one of the elements he would probably wish to take into
                    account was the inevitable requirement for some method of providing assistance
                    to the Brussels signatories in connection with any regional association or
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>Forrestal said that, in order to carry out the targets agreed to earlier this
                    year, he thought the military establishment budgets would have to be increased.
                    Last Tuesday he mentioned a figure of something under 18 billions as a middle
                    figure between the requests from the military establishment and the budgeted
                    ceiling of 15 billions.</p>
                <p>The conversation ended in a discussion of the possibility of the urgent need for
                    economies in the overhead costs of the military services and in the avoidance of
                    unnecessary duplication.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_644">p. 644</ref>.</note> The
                    memorandum I wrote you was based on two conversations I had with Forrestal at
                    his request and which were, apparently in the nature of a prologue to his letter
                    mentioned above.</p>
                <p>Because of the nature of Forrestal’s letter, I discussed the matter <pb n="649"
                        xml:id="pg_649" facs="0159"/>with Kennan and we decided that it might be of
                    some use to you in preparing your reply if we passed on a composite of our
                    recollections of the genesis of this matter with a few comments which might have
                    a bearing on our exodus.</p>
                <p>Forrestal states that when you and he and Secretary Snyder<note n="3"
                        xml:id="d54fn3">John W. Snyder, Secretary of the Treasury.</note> talked
                    over the matter covered by his letter with the President,<note n="4"
                        xml:id="d54fn4">For an account of the White House meeting: of May 7, 1948,
                        attended by Marshall, Forrestal, Snyder, and others, see Millis, <hi
                            rend="italic">The Forrestal Diaries</hi>, pp. 431–432.</note> you stated
                    that “our plans should be predicated on the assumption that we were <hi

                    must be a considerable over-simplification of what you actually said. Kennan’s
                    group prepared on June 23 a paper designed to clarify the relation of U.S.
                    defense preparations to the political situation which lay before us.<note n="5"

                    of that paper was that</p>
                <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>“… a U.S. defense policy based on the maintenance of a permanent state of
                        adequate military preparation meets better the requirements of the
                        situation, insofar as these arise out of Soviet policies and attitudes, than
                        a defense effort pointed toward a given estimated peak of war danger.”</p>
                </quote>
                <p rend="flushleft">I have a faint recollection that in one of these conversations
                    the question came up as to whether the maximum military strength should be aimed
                    at the year ’51, ’52, ’53, etc. These dates apparently had some relation to the
                    guesses being made as to the earliest time at which the Soviets might reasonably
                    be expected to have an effective atomic bomb.</p>
                <p>It has occurred to Kennan and myself that possibly it was the thought expressed
                    in the above quotation, against the background of an attempt to select a
                    particular year for ultimate defense readiness, that you were expressing and
                    which Forrestal has quoted so summarily. If our guess is right this might be
                    brought out in the reply.</p>
                <p>The specific questions (<hi rend="italic">a, b</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>) which Forrestal asks of you seem to reflect two assumptions which we
                    think-may be open to question. The first of these is that there is such a thing
                    as an objective world situation, independent of our own policies, to which our
                    defense preparations are only a reaction.</p>
                <p>The second is that the Secretary of State has the special and exclusive
                    facilities for analyzing this world situation and the sole responsibility for
                    describing and interpreting it as a basis for our defense policy.</p>
                <p>The first of these assumptions appears to be wrong because the question as to
                    whether or not we will need to use our armed forces, in an international sense,
                    at any given time lies to a large extent with ourselves. <pb n="650"
                        xml:id="pg_650" facs="0160"/>If, therefore, Forrestal wants to know whether
                    the world situation is developing in a way which means that there is an
                    increasing likelihood of war, the answer would seem to be that that depends in
                    considerable part on the decision of the President, acting on the advice of the
                    National Security Council, of which Mr. Forrestal is a member.</p>
                <p>To the extent that events outside of our control or influence do alter the
                    international background against which our defense policies must be formed, we
                    do not think that the military establishment is entitled to place, by
                    implication, the entire onus of analyzing and interpreting this situation on the
                    Secretary of State. The intelligence which the Secretary of State has at his
                    disposal concerning world events is substantially the same as that which is
                    available to the President and to the other members of the National Security
                    Council, and his voice is only one of those whose advice the President would
                    wish to hear in making the decisions which involve an estimate of future
                    developments affecting national security.</p>
                <p>We have attempted to frame answers to Forrestal’s specific questions in the light
                    of the background given above. For what little they may be worth, I set them out
                    below: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Q. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Has there been an improvement in the
                            international picture which would warrant a substantial reduction in the
                            military forces we had planned to have in being by the end of the
                            current fiscal year?</p>
                        <p>A. Obviously there has been no such improvement in the international
                            picture.</p>
                        <p>Q. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Has the situation worsened since last
                            spring and should we, therefore, be considering an augmentation of the
                            forces that we were planning at that time?</p>
                        <p>A. There is no sign that the basic Soviet policies have undergone any
                            change since last spring. However, we must recognize that the Berlin
                            conflict has produced a worsening of the situation, since it has placed
                            us in an awkward position from which we may not be able to extricate
                            ourselves except by a strong show, or use, of armed strength. This
                            increased danger relates, of course, to our immediate needs for the
                            coming winter and spring. Needs for fiscal 1950 cannot now be accurately
                            estimated. They will depend to an important extent on what happens
                            between now and next July. In these circumstances, we should prepare for
                            the least favorable of possible developments. This would certainly call
                            for no planned diminution of the strength we are now aiming at for the
                            end of this year, and probably for an actual increase.</p>

                    concerning United States information policy with regard to anti-American
                    propaganda.</p>
                <p>Attention is directed to paragraph 6 of enclosure one of the reference
                    instruction wherein it is stated that, within the framework established by the
                    full text of both enclosures, one of the objectives of the information policy
                    with regard to anti-American propaganda is: “To gain acceptance, among the
                    people of third countries, of the truth about the policies and actions of the
                    USSR and its satellites with a view to strengthening opposition to the USSR and
                    to Communist organizations.” Attention is also directed to paragraphs 6 and 9 of
                    enclosure two of the reference instruction wherein it is stated that in the
                    information program: “We should expose Soviet policies and actions that directly
                    or indirectly jeopardize the interests of third countries, their independence or
                    the aspirations of free men in those countries … and “We should expose the
                    discrepancy between professed Soviet and Communist aims and actual Soviet and
                    Communist practices on all major issues which illustrate the distinction between
                    democratic and totalitarian government …”</p>
                <p>In order to assist officers in the field responsible for the information and
                    educational program to implement the above objectives, the Department is
                    prepared to provide such officers, on a continuing basis, with factual studies
                    specifically aimed at exposing discrepancies between professed Soviet aims and
                    actual Soviet practices.</p>
                <p>These studies are prepared by a special section of the Office of Intelligence
                    Research of the Department, in consultation, with other appropriate offices of
                    the Department and in accordance with suggestions of the Embassy in Moscow.
                    These studies are based on concrete and documented sources, liberally using
                    quotations from Soviet sources. They avoid a polemical tone, and hold
                    editorializing to a minimum, on the assumption that the evidence alone is more
                    effective than argumentation. Subject matter of the studies is selected
                    primarily in accordance with current developments in Soviet policies and
                    activities. Each study is complete in itself, though most are related to a few
                    important central themes. Besides their primary purpose in implementing the
                    information program, it is hoped that they will be helpful to the members <pb
                        n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0162"/>of the mission for their own
                    information and to enable them more effectively to present an informal point of
                    view in their local contacts.</p>
                <p>Copies of the first several numbers in the series of studies are enclosed both
                    for immediate use, if appropriate, and to serve as examples of the scope and
                    nature of the entire project. Others will be forwarded as prepared.</p>
                <p>The studies may be used by Information Officers and other members of the Mission
                    at their own discretion for best effect. In order to avoid defeating our
                    purposes, however, officers are urged to use reserve and discrimination, it
                    being particularly desirable to avoid any widespread knowledge that US agencies
                    are engaging in this activity.</p>
                <p>The Department will appreciate suggestions and comments, to be submitted by cable
                    at the earliest possible date, regarding the entire project, the materials
                    enclosed, and subjects for future studies peculiarly appropriate for
                    dissemination in particular areas. General and specific reports concerning the
                    use made of the studies should be included in the regular monthly reports of
                        <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> offices.</p>

                </p>
                <p>There has been no improvement in the international situation which would warrant
                    any reduction in the military forces planned for the end of the current fiscal
                    year. There has as yet been no indication of any basic change in the policy of
                    hostility towards the non-Soviet world, and in particular the United States,
                    pursued by the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The responsibility which this country bears in the world today cannot be expected
                    to diminish until there has been a substantial return of strength and stability
                    to the free nations of Europe. There are no grounds for expecting any decisive
                    accretion of strength to the natura] Allies of the United States by the end of
                    the current fiscal year.</p>
                <p>The responsibilities of the United States as a factor restraining aggressive
                    action on the part of the Soviet Union will remain unchanged insofar as any
                    present estimates are concerned.</p>
                <p>The only new element in the European situation since last spring is the situation
                    in Berlin and the continuance of the Soviet blockade. As long as the Berlin
                    situation continues in its present form—and there are no adequate grounds as yet
                    for believing that a settlement is in sight—while not in itself an inevitable
                    cause of armed conflict, given certain developments such as a possible failure
                    of the airlift during the winter months it can result in a condition in which
                    the United States might be compelled to employ armed force in order to maintain
                    its position in Berlin.</p>
                <p>In short, I would say that while there are certain optimistic portents for the
                    long-range future, we must expect for the current fiscal year a situation which
                    is neither better nor worse than that which we have faced in 1948 in so far as
                    it affects the ceiling of our military establishment.</p>
                <p>The larger question of the relationship of our military establishment to our
                    responsibilities in the foreign field is, as you say, not a question susceptible
                    of an easy answer. A variety of factors must be brought into relationship with
                    the ultimate decision.</p>
                <p>In my opinion there are two factors, however, which bear directly on the question
                    which you put to me.</p>
                <p>I regard it as essential, in order that we may continue to exercise the restraint
                    upon possible Soviet aggressive action, that we should be in such a state of
                    continuous readiness as to cause the Soviet Union to fear immediate retaliation
                    on our part. This would involve the maintenance <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654"
                        facs="0164"/>of a striking force, particularly in the field of air power
                    with the necessary concomitants throughout the national defense establishment,
                    which would permit us the possibility of swift and effective retaliation.</p>
                <p>The second factor which must be considered is that in the last analysis it is the
                    productive potential of the United States which constitutes the general
                    restraining factor in the world today. It would be, in my opinion, unwise for
                    the United States to devote such a proportion of our national production to the
                    maintenance of an existing military establishment so as to impair the potential
                    productivity of our national economy.</p>
                <p>It is impossible for me from here to enter into any discussion as to the ceiling
                    figure which would accomplish the first objective without impairing the second.
                    I can only repeat that there is nothing in the world situation which, in my
                    opinion, would justify the United States in reducing below the planned level the
                    size of its military establishment. The psychological effect abroad of a
                    reduction at this time would, I am confident, bring dismay to our friends and
                    supporters in Europe who are looking to us to hold the line during the period in
                    which their defense capabilities are brought up to the level which would permit
                    a restoration of a natural balance of forces on the continent of Europe.<note

                    particular point with Forrestal as to existence of an objective world situation

                <p>Last spring when Forrestal, Snyder, and I talked to the President, the discussion
                    was designed to give some semblance of order (some attempt to recoup our lost
                    military stature), to the dilemma we found ourselves in without even a token
                    military establishment in being. You will recall that <gloss target="#t_UMT1"
                        >UMT</gloss> was the keystone of this effort. I told Forrestal then that he
                    should plan on building his forces within a balanced national economy, and that
                    the country could not, and would not, support a budget based on preparation for
                    war. This view still holds. It has nothing to do with the international
                    situation as such—it is designed to get the most security without putting the
                    nation on a war-time footing.</p>

                        <p>The responsibility which this country bears in the world today cannot be
                            expected to diminish until there has been a substantial return of
                            strength and stability to the free nations of Europe. There are no
                            grounds for expecting any decisive accretion of strength to the natural
                            allies of the United States by the end of the current fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>The responsibilities of the United States as a factor restraining
                            aggressive action on the part of the Soviet Union will remain unchanged
                            insofar as any present estimates are concerned. The only new element in
                            the European situation since last spring is the situation in Berlin and
                            the continuance of the Soviet blockade.</p>
                        <p>In short, I would say that while there are certain optimistic portents
                            for the long-range future, we must expect for the current fiscal year a
                            situation which is neither better nor worse than that which we have
                            faced in 1948 insofar as it affects the ceiling of our military
                            establishment.</p>
                        <p>There is a further consideration which relates to the two factors just
                            mentioned. Our policy should be to build up Western Europe ground forces
                            which means the provision of munitions. We should not, at this stage,
                            proceed to build up US ground forces for the express purpose of
                            employing them in Western Europe.”</p>

                    <p>In order to make the catalog comprehensive and fully responsive to your
                        request, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the term “commitment” in
                        its broadest sense. Thus, there have been included not only actual
                        assignments of forces, such as military occupation commitments, but also
                        commitments of a less tangible nature, such as those implicit in pledges,
                        pacts, contingent military action and our foreign policies.</p>
                    <p>Since the less tangible commitments, although in many cases potentially
                        enormous, are not susceptible of measurement in other than general terms, no
                        effort has been made to tabulate all of the armed forces involved. For
                        information and ready reference, the current troop bases<note n="†"
                            xml:id="d59fn7">The term “troop basis” as used in this memorandum is
                            defined as an approved list of the number of military personnel required
                            for the performance of a particular mission. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> for major actual (occupational) commitments are listed,
                        but other commitments are not expressed in figures. Other commitments are
                        either potential (not measurable, but varying in importance from small to
                        vast) or minor actual (measurable, but not of great relative importance).
                        Therefore, the sum of all measurable commitments would be misleading. The
                        current deployment of all of our armed forces can be set forth if and when
                        required, however, as a separate matter.</p>

                    <p>Since it has not been practicable to make all of the listings of the catalog
                        mutually exclusive, there is some overlapping, particularly with regard to
                        the matter of implications. For the purposes of this paper, however, the
                        implications involved in each requirement, predetermined action or pledge
                        have been considered in connection with the military responsibilities on
                        which they are based.</p>
                    <p>Some of the very large number of international arrangements which involve
                        possible security commitments and some of the numerous military requirements
                        for the support of United States foreign policy may have been omitted from
                        the catalog. Any such omission, however, is of a minor nature and involves
                        military interest only as a remote possibility.</p>
                    <p>While the catalog is necessarily voluminous, its major commitment
                        implications, a number of which are currently very great, can be readily
                        summarized and this has been done hereunder. This summary <pb n="658"

                                        leased areas and trust territories, but also of the other
                                        American states. These policies further include assistance
                                        to other free nations, the security of which is of critical
                                        importance to the United States, if they are to present
                                        effective resistance to Communist aggression. The
                                        implications of this latter commitment, in view of the
                                        current attitude and capabilities of the USSR, can easily
                                        and rapidly extend to global warfare.</item>

                            <item>It is clear from the above summary of commitments and their
                                implications and from the attitude and capabilities of the USSR,
                                together with the determination of the United States to resist
                                communist aggression, and over-all commitment which in itself is
                                all-inclusive and with which, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are firmly
                                in agreement, that it is essential to our national security to bring
                                our military strength to a level commensurate with the distinct
                                possibility of global warfare.</item>

                            <item>As to this possibility, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while
                                recognizing the probability that the USSR does not intend at present
                                to resort to war as a means of aggression, must recognize also the
                                likelihood that the USSR will resort to war when, in terms of their
                                comparative readiness and their need to exert overt force, it best
                                serves their purpose. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize further
                                that unforeseen developments, internal conditions in the USSR,
                                miscalculation by the Soviets as to the degree of our determination
                                to resist further encroachment by them, or miscalculation by
                                ourselves as to the degree of opposition the Soviets will accept
                                without concluding that initiation of war is mandatory, may singly
                                or together result in early major hostilities.</item>

                            <item>In either case—the probability of war in a few years or the
                                possibility of war soon—the Joint Chiefs of Staff are convinced that
                                their previous views with respect to steps that should be taken for
                                improving our military strength and state of readiness are sound and
                                that developments since these views were first expressed make it
                                more than ever essential to continue with their early
                                implementation. For ready reference these views may be summarized as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Measures that should now be taken should provide not only for
                                        increased military manpower (not limited to present
                                        peacetime strength) but also for increased appropriations
                                        necessary for strengthening our National Military
                                        Establishment. With respect to initiation of civilian and
                                        industrial mobilization, because of the inherent and quite
                                        possibly critical length of time required for legislative
                                        action, the necessary statutory authorizations should be
                                        sought now for civilian and industrial readiness, such
                                        authorizations to correspond to those found essential during
                                        World War II and to be invoked as and to the extent
                                        required.</p>
                                    <p>If political considerations should result in determination
                                        that this step is not now practicable, every possible effort
                                        should be devoted now to advance planning directed toward
                                        reduction to a minimum of the time lag between decision and
                                        action when legislative steps of this nature do become
                                        politically possible.</p>
                                    <p>In essence, the basic objectives should be that measures
                                        taken now for strengthening promptly the National Military
                                        Establishment should meet at least the requirements for
                                        effective emergency action, and that, to every practicable
                                        extent, provision should be made for extending the scope of
                                        such measures to all-out war effort without avoidable
                                        delay.</p>

                            <item>Our military strength and state of readiness are being improved.
                                Not all necessary steps have been taken, however, and it is not to
                                be expected that anything can eliminate the inherent and dangerous
                                time interval, even should there be inauguration of full
                                mobilization, before adequate preparedness for major war effort can
                                result.</item>

                            <item>Thus, it remains true, as stated previously by the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff, that, from the standpoint of national security, every effort
                                should be made to avoid actual United States military commitment, in
                                the sense of committing any of our armed forces to military action,
                                unless and until <hi rend="italic">preceded</hi> by adequate
                                preparedness. This was further discussed in the enclosure to a

                                of our potential commitment regarding peace enforcement in Palestine
                                would, as in the case of implementation of many of the other
                                commitments summarized above, result in non-availability of troops
                                for emergency deployment to any other area, seriously delay the
                                military strengthening now being undertaken, and jeopardize our
                                national security because of our inability to meet, for some time to
                                come, the further military demands that would inevitably develop
                                from any initial, actual commitment of our armed forces to
                                action.</item>

                            <item>The extreme inadvisability, as set forth above, of any actual
                                commitment to action of our armed forces at this time is accentuated
                                by the fact that, as a corollary, no other such commitment elsewhere
                                would then be practicable, whereas the scope of our obligations and
                                the present state and trend of the world situation demand our
                                readiness to back up these obligations in numerous areas. A
                                pertinent case is the Berlin situation, which in itself demands not
                                only every effort to expedite the strengthening of our military
                                posture but also the husbanding of every military resource we now
                                have.</item>

                            <item>As the Joint Chiefs of Staff have previously stated, the great
                                importance to our national security of keeping our military
                                capabilities abreast of our foreign commitments and their
                                implications cannot be over-emphasized. This is to be construed not
                                as non-concurrence with any phase of United States foreign or
                                international policy but simply as recognition of the responsibility
                                of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for national security, together with
                                recognition of the fact that current United States commitments
                                involving the use or distinctly possible use of armed forces are
                                very greatly in excess of our present ability to fulfill them either
                                promptly or effectively. The importance of this view is confirmed in
                                the National Security Act of 1947, which states that it is the duty
                                of the National Security Council “to assess and appraise the
                                objectives, commitments, and risks of the United States in relation
                                to our actual and potential military power in the interests of
                                national security . . . . . .”</item>

                            <item>From the military viewpoint and as evidenced by the consistent
                                trend of the Soviet attitude, our <hi rend="italic">potential</hi>
                                military power and our determination to resist further Soviet
                                encroachment have not caused the Soviets to cease their aggressions.
                                On the other hand, lack of readiness constitutes, apparently, actual
                                encouragement to aggression while also jeopardizing our national
                                security in the event of war.</item>

                                foreign policy, but also as prudent insurance against

                            Objectives With Respect to the USSR To Counter Soviet Threats to U.S.

                    <p>1. To assess and appraise existing and foreseeable threats to our national
                        security currently posed by the USSR; and to formulate our objectives and
                        aims as a guide in determining measures required to counter such
                        threats.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>2. The will and ability of the leaders of the USSR to pursue policies which
                        threaten the security of the United States constitute the greatest single
                        danger to the U.S. within the foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>3. Communist ideology and Soviet behavior clearly demonstrate that the
                        ultimate objective of the leaders of the USSR is the domination of the
                        world. Soviet leaders hold that the Soviet communist party is the militant
                        vanguard of the world proletariat in its rise to political power, and that
                        the USSR, base of the world communist movement, will not be safe until the
                        non-communist nations have been so reduced in strength and numbers that
                        communist influence is dominant throughout the world. The immediate goal of
                        top priority since the recent war has been the political conquest of western
                        Europe. The resistance of the United States is recognized by the USSR as a
                        major obstacle to the attainment of these goals.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviet leaders appear to be pursuing these aims by: <list>

                    <p>6. It is impossible to calculate with any degree of precision the dimensions
                        of the threat to U.S. security presented by these Soviet measures short of
                        war. The success of these measures depends on a wide variety of currently
                        unpredictable factors, including the degree of resistance encountered
                        elsewhere, the effectiveness of U.S. policy, the development of
                        relationships within the Soviet structure of power, etc. Had the United
                        States not taken vigorous measures during the past two years to stiffen the
                        resistance of western European and Mediterranean countries to communist
                        pressures, most of western Europe would today have been politically captured
                        by the communist movement. Today, barring some radical alteration of the
                        underlying situation which would give new possibilities to the communists,
                        the communists appear to have little chance of effecting at this juncture
                        the political conquest of any countries west of the Luebeck-Trieste line.
                        The unsuccessful outcome of this political offensive has in turn created
                        serious problems for them behind the iron curtain, and their policies are
                        today probably motivated in large measure by defensive considerations.
                        However, it cannot be assumed that Soviet capabilities for subversion and
                        political aggression will decrease in the next decade, and they may become
                        even more dangerous than at present.</p>
                    <p>7. In present circumstances the capabilities of the USSR to threaten U.S.

                                into the Soviet system. This would permit an eventual concentration
                                of hostile power which would pose an unacceptable threat to the

                        Soviet forces. If the United States were to exploit the potentialities of
                        psychological warfare and subversive activity within the Soviet orbit, the
                        USSR would be faced with increased disaffection, discontent, and underground
                        opposition within the area under Soviet control.</p>
                    <p>9. Present estimates indicate that the current Soviet capabilities mentioned
                        in 7-<hi rend="italic">a</hi> above will progressively increase and that by
                        no later than 1955 the USSR will probably be capable of serious air attacks
                        against the United States with atomic, biological and chemical weapons, of
                        more extensive submarine operations (including the launching of short-range
                        guided missiles), and of airborne operations to seize advance bases.
                        However, the USSR could not, even then, successfully undertake an invasion
                        of the United States as long as effective U.S. military forces remained in
                        being. Soviet capabilities for overrunning western Europe and the Near East
                        and for occupying parts of the Far East will probably still exist by
                        1958.</p>
                    <p>10. The Soviet capabilities and the increases thereto set forth in this paper
                        would result in a relative increase in Soviet capabilities vis-à-vis the
                        United States and the Western democracies unless offset by factors such as

                        political warfare will involve armed conflict, nevertheless there exists a

                                action under a miscalculation of the determination and willingness
                                of the United States to resort to force in order to prevent the
                                development of a threat intolerable to U.S. security.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>12. In addition to the risk of war, a danger equally to be guarded against is
                        the possibility that Soviet political warfare might seriously weaken the
                        relative position of the United States, enhance Soviet strength and either
                        lead to our ultimate defeat short of war, or force us into war under
                        dangerously unfavorable conditions. Such a result would be facilitated by
                        vacillation, appeasement or isolationist concepts in our foreign policy,
                        leading to loss of our allies and influence; by internal disunity or
                        subversion; by economic instability in the form of depression or inflation;
                        or by either excessive or inadequate armament and foreign aid
                        expenditures.</p>
                    <p>13. To counter threats to our national security and to create conditions
                        conducive to a positive and in the long term mutually beneficial
                        relationship between the Russian people and our own, it is essential that
                        this government formulate general objectives which are capable of sustained
                        pursuit both in time of peace and in the event of war. From the general
                        objectives flow certain specific aims which we seek to accomplish by methods
                        short of war, as well as certain other aims which we seek to accomplish in

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: In accordance with the
                    instructions contained in the memorandum of July 16, 1948 from the Director of
                    the Bureau of the Budget,<note n="1" xml:id="d61fn1">Not found in the files of
                        the Department of State.</note> I have today made a formal submittal of a
                    proposed national security budget, calling for new obligational authority within
                        <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0180"/>the tentative ceiling figure of 15
                    billion dollars, details of which have been forwarded to the Bureau of the
                    Budget over the past several weeks. The tentative ceiling of 15 billion dollars
                    included approximately 600 million dollars for other items—as, for example, the
                    525 million dollars for stockpiling funds to be appropriated to the Treasury
                    Department—leaving a net amount of 14.4 billion dollars for military activities
                    of the National Military Establishment.</p>
                <p>As I have previously informed you orally, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not
                    believe that our national security can be adequately safeguarded with the forces
                    which can be maintained under this 14.4 billion dollar budget. It is their
                    recommendation that forces are needed which would require that an amount
                    approximating 23 billion dollars be appropriated for the maintenance of our
                    national security during fiscal year 1950.</p>
                <p>For purposes of ready comparison, the military strengths that can be maintained
                    under the 14.4 billion figure and tinder the 23 billion figure can be summarized
                    as follows: <table rows="7" cols="5">

                <p>I have, as you know, devoted a number of months to a most thorough and detailed
                    study of the military budget for 1950. It is my profound conviction that the
                    budget which you should recommend to the Congress falls somewhere between the
                    extremes of the 14.4 billion figure, which represents the tentative fiscal
                    limitation contained in the July 16 memorandum, and the 23 billion figure which
                    is based on the forces recommended to me by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>In the light of existing international conditions, in the light of the impact of
                    rising prices on the Military Establishment, and after giving long and serious
                    consideration to the fiscal impact of national security requirements and to the
                    effect of such requirements on scarce materials and civilian production, it is
                    my belief that you should recommend to the Congress a national security budget
                    for military activities in the amount of 16.9 billion dollars.</p>
                <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have unanimously agreed on the increase in the forces
                    that should be maintained by each Service, and the funds <pb n="671"
                        xml:id="pg_671" facs="0181"/>needed by each Department to support such
                    forces, if a budget of 16.9 billion should be enacted—but the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff do not consider that the forces provided by such a budget will furnish the
                    strength necessary for our national defense under present international
                    conditions. However, after taking into account the fiscal and economic impact on
                    the country of additional appropriations for military purposes, I do not believe
                    I can conscientiously recommend a budget larger than 16.9 billion, unless the
                    international situation should become more serious.</p>
                <p>While the 16.9 budget is closer to Mr. Webb’s<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">James E.
                        Webb, Director of the Bureau of the Budget.</note> figure of 14.4 than it is
                    to the Joint Chiefs’ figure of 23, I believe that this intermediate amount will

                <p>I want to emphasize that all three of these budgets which are outlined in some
                    detail in the attachment are based on mutual support of the Services by one
                    another—part of the strength of each of the Services representing forces which
                    must be maintained in order to make possible the effective utilization of forces
                    of another Service.</p>
                <p>The attachment which I enclose<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">Not printed.</note>
                    spells out in some detail the strengths which can be maintained under the three
                    budgets I have mentioned. The strength of the different forces and the
                    implications of each have a very definite impact on the strategic concepts which
                    would be utilized in any war situation. As I have indicated to you orally, I
                    stand ready, along with the Departmental Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff to give you an oral presentation on just what each of these three budgets
                    means when translated into terms of our ability to protect throughout the world
                    the interests of the United States.<note n="4" xml:id="d61fn4">The oral
                        presentation occurred at the White House on December 9. President Truman was
                        not convinced of the advisability of expanding the military budget (Millis,

                            from fields which it is estimated the Soviets have the capability of
                            developing in the East Cape Area of Siberia. In the Bremerton–Tacoma

                <p>The measures now being taken by the responsible Fleet Commanders to safeguard our
                    ships provide security watches capable of meeting anticipated emergencies, and
                    guarding against sabotage and surprise attack to a limited extent. It is
                    impossible to extend the scope of these measures to guard effectively against
                    surprise attack without disrupting normal Fleet upkeep and training routine and
                    causing public alarm.</p>

                <p>To guard effectively our concentrations of naval vessels against surprise attack
                    would require the continuous maintenance of an air early warning and fighter
                    interceptor alert; and the protection of our harbors by air and surface patrols,
                    netting, mining, installing and operating Harbor Entrance Control Posts and
                    underwater detection devices. To insure against sabotage all visiting to naval
                    vessels and to those naval activities whose facilities are required for the
                    rapid reactivation of the Reserve Fleet should be prohibited.</p>
                <p>The serious impact of the implementation of such stringent measures as those
                    outlined above upon the public peace of mind and upon the capabilities of the
                    Naval Establishment to maintain essential training and upkeep schedules within
                    the limitations of a peace time budget are obvious.</p>
                <p>The Navy Department would appreciate greatly advice as to whether the State
                    Department believes that there is sufficient likelihood of surprise attack,
                    under the existing international conditions, to warrant effecting now the
                    stringent measures outlined above to effectively guard our Fleets against such
                    an attack, regardless of the consequent public alarm.</p>

                    against concentrations of naval vessels in United States ports to warrant
                    effecting now stringent precautionary measures.</p>
                <p>As the intelligence available to the Secretary of State concerning world events
                    is substantially the same as that which is available to the President and to the
                    other National Security Council members, judgments involving an estimate of
                    future developments affecting the National defense would seem to be properly
                    ones for the National Security Council as a whole. With this explanation, I

                            no evidence that Soviet intentions run toward launching a sudden <pb

                            felt themselves either politically extremely weak, or militarily

                            the arguments in Soviet councils of those, if there are any such, who
                            favor preventive action before the military strength of the West can be

                <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Base Rights for the United States in Return for
                    Military Aid to Foreign Nations.</p>
                <p>Since the submission on 2 August 1948 of their memorandum to you regarding
                    Over-all Examination of United States requirements for Military Bases and Base
                        Rights,<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">
                        <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_603">p. 603</ref>.</note> the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff have given further consideration to this matter in the
                    light of various international developments and of current emergency planning.
                    They <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0185"/>believe that the general trend of
                    events makes it more important than ever that needed bases and base rights be
                    obtained to the fullest extent that may be practicable and without avoidable
                    delay.</p>
                <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also become increasingly aware of the inherent
                    fact that lack of needed bases and base rights can, because of its limiting
                    effect on the capabilities of our armed forces for both offensive and defensive
                    operations, constitute an indirect but definite and possibly very great
                    weakening of the National Military Establishment. Thus, it is apparent that the
                    degree of success that may be had in negotiations for base rights can be a
                    factor of perhaps momentous influence with respect to budgetary dividends in
                    terms of expenditure effectiveness, in planning, in actual war strategy, and
                    even on both the length and the outcome of war.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that the diplomatic
                    problems of negotiations for base rights are both difficult and time-consuming
                    and that their complexities and obstacles have made it impossible to date to
                    arrive at successful solution in many cases. But, since the military
                    implications of the situation are so pronounced, the Joint Chiefs of Staff offer
                    the suggestion that both success and speed might be served to an important
                    extent by use in negotiations of two points: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>First, that it would be a wholly logical extension of mutual military aid
                            for the recipients to make our <hi rend="italic">combat</hi> aid in war
                            emergency more effective by granting appropriate base rights;</p>
                        <p>Second, that it would, accordingly, seem appropriate that normally the
                            granting of military aid should be coupled with negotiations for the
                            consideration of United States base rights requirements.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
                <p>While there may be overriding political considerations which would make it
                    impracticable to adopt the above suggestion, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note that
                    such a course is not without precedent and they believe that it has high
                    potentialities in terms of its overall effect on our national security. If the
                    principle of <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> in the form of base concessions
                    is favorably considered it would apply primarily to the members of Western Union
                    and to those other countries who may become parties to the proposed North
                    Atlantic Pact, since it is assumed that these countries will be the primary
                    recipients of military aid and since they control many of the more important
                    base rights that are required.</p>
                <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that approval of this principle is in
                    consonance with the broad principles approved by the President in <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 14/1 (The Position of the United States with
                    Respect to Providing Military Assistance to Nations of the Non-Soviet

                    participating in military assistance programs should be encouraged so far as
                    consistent with the progressive stabilization of their economies to compensate
                    the supplying nation for the military assistance which they receive whenever and
                    to what extent feasible.</p>
                <p>With the foregoing discussion in mind, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will review the
                    situation with respect to needed base rights and submit detailed recommendations
                    regarding those applicable to their suggestion on advice from you that the
                    second of the points listed above is accepted in principle.</p>

                                Washington, November 16, 1945. This document, known as the Heads of
                                Agreement memorandum, recommended points for consideration by the
                                Combined Policy Committee in preparation of a new document to
                                replace the Quebec Agreement; for text, see <ref

                    <p>The State Department had been chiefly concerned from its point of view with
                        winding up the ambiguous agreements; the Atomic Energy Commission had wished
                        to ease a raw material shortage which threatened to curtail its
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett showed to the senators the text of a draft minute of the Combined
                        Policy Committee,<note n="8" xml:id="d65fn8">Of January 6, <ref
                                target="#pg_683">p. 683</ref>.</note> agreed among the U.S.-U.K. and
                        Canada representatives, together with Combined Policy Committee documents
                        establishing a formula for allocation of raw materials and for interchange
                        of information of mutual benefit. The wartime agreements, except as they
                        relate to requirement and other necessary functions, are terminated by
                        mutual consent; the U.S. gets all production from the principal source for
                        next two years; U.S. operating needs in future are assured; the U.K.
                        stockpile in excess of minimum operating requirement will be progressively
                        reduced to almost a fifth of its present size.</p>
                    <p>Senator Vandenberg expressed relief that the wartime agreements had been
                        rescinded. He believed the State Department negotiations represented a
                        considerable accomplishment, and that more had been obtained than he thought
                        possible. He offered his congratulations to the Department. Senator
                        Hickenlooper expressed a similar opinion and said he believed that the Joint
                        Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy would be satisfied with the
                        arrangements.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Derry said that, from the point of view of the Commission, the
                        arrangement on raw materials was a good one, and that if it had not been

                    <p>Mr. Lilienthal raised in this connection the interpretation of paragraph 6 of
                        the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>. He pointed out that the subjects
                        on the initial list of subjects for technical cooperation were necessarily
                        rather widely defined and that separate topics in each of these areas would
                        require consideration in the light of the laws of the three countries. It
                        would not therefore be possible to give full discretionary authority to the
                        U.S. member of the proposed standing Sub-group.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Makins said that it was well understood that the three members of the
                        proposed Sub-group would be guided by the instructions of their respective
                        national authorities, which in the case of the U.S. member would no doubt be
                        the United States Atomic Energy Commission. It was his understanding that
                        the Sub-group would not normally need to refer to the Combined Policy
                        Committee, except in <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0192"/>case of
                        disagreement or difficulty in effecting cooperation, or for the purpose of

                    <p>The British Ambassador said that the declarations made and decisions taken at
                        the meeting inaugurated a new and hopeful chapter in the association of the
                        three countries in atomic energy development. He expressed appreciation of
                        the frank and helpful attitude which had been shown during the discussions
                        and said that the U.K. members were deeply impressed by Mr. Forrestal’s
                        statement at the Committee’s last meeting<note n="19" xml:id="d66fn19"
                            >December 15, 1947.</note> that he regarded the United Kingdom and
                        Canada as partners in the field of atomic energy. This was also their
                        conception of the relationship which had just been established. The United
                        Kingdom expected this partnership to develop and extend rapidly. Lort
                        Inverchapel expressed the belief that, as its programme developed, the
                        United Kingdom would have an increasingly useful contribution to make toward
                        the work of the partnership.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett expressed the appreciation of the U.S. members and of the United
                        States Government of the parts played by the United Kingdom and Canada in
                        reaching the new basis of understanding, which he believed was in the common
                        cause. He also expressed his personal appreciation of the spiriit and manner
                        in which the discussions had been conducted.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian Ambassador expressed his belief that the understanding reached
                        represented a considerable accomplishment. He too referred to the spirit in
                        which the discussions had been conducted and expressed thanks to the
                        Chairman for the part which he had played.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>

                        <p>Apart from the arrangements which already exist between the United
                            Kingdom and Canada, the question has arisen of co-operation between the
                            United Kingdom and other members of the British Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>2. As a part of the combined effort during the war years, assistance to
                            the British atomic energy project was given by scientists from New
                            Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Some of these have worked in Canada
                            and some in United States and from there have moved to Harwell.<note

                        <p>The three <gloss target="#t_CPC1">C.P.C.</gloss> governments are also
                            actively co-operating with the Dominions in the field of raw materials.
                            South Africa in particular is likely to become an important source of
                            raw materials and is carrying out active work on beneficiation of ores.
                            In due course South African interests may be expected to extend.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chairman—Gentlemen</hi>. I am pleased to be able to
                        report to you that we have successfully concluded negotiations with the
                        British and the Canadians with respect to cooperation in atomic energy
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that in these talks we had the following objectives: First,
                        to terminate certain secret war-time agreements which appeared to place
                        unwarranted restraints on our course of action. Second; to secure a
                        redistribution of available uranium ore which would be more favorable to us;
                        this meant that the stockpile in Britain had to be reduced and most of it
                        dispersed outside the British Isles. Third; to insure an increase in the
                        supplies of uranium available to the United States in the next few years, or
                        at least until such time as new methods and techniques could reduce our
                        dependence on imports; Fourth, to remove sources of misunderstanding and
                        friction among ourselves and United Kingdom and Canada.</p>
                    <p>From its point of view the State Department’s chief concern was to close out
                        the anomalous war-time agreements in such a way as to <pb n="689"
                            xml:id="pg_689" facs="0199"/>preserve some basis for cooperation in
                        procurement of raw materials; we especially wanted to get rid of some of the
                        political overtones and commitments in these agreements, particularly such
                        clauses as those which appeared to bind this country to consult with the
                        United Kingdom before it could use the atom bomb.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2"
                            >Reference is to the Quebec Agreement, which specified that atomic
                            weapons would not be used against third parties by the United States or
                            the United Kingdom without the consent of the other.</note> For its
                        part, the Atomic Energy Commission naturally addressed itself to the raw
                        materials problem which was the heart of the negotiations. Mr. Lilienthal,
                        Mr. Carroll Wilson, and his helpers worked out what I consider to tea very
                        ingenious and satisfactory formula on raw materials which they will report
                        to you.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to report that all the Departments represented in these
                        negotiations—State, Defense, and the Commission—consider that we have
                        attained our objectives; in fact, I think we have achieved more than we
                        might have expected before the talks were begun, and certainly more than
                        appeared possible after the first day of the talks.</p>
                    <p>First, as to the war-time agreements—these have been terminated by mutual
                        consent except as they relate to procurement and other functions which all
                        of us wish to see continue. All embarrassing political provisions such as
                        that in the case of the bomb have been eliminated. This has been done
                        informally but in a manner which clearly registers the intent of the
                        participating governments. I have here a piece of paper, rather tentatively
                        entitled a “<hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi>” which is in the form of a
                        Minute of a Meeting of the U.S.–U.K.–Canada Combined Policy Committee.</p>

                        is a means of operating, pending conclusion of a permanent international
                        agreement which, in this case, would be a convention on international
                        control of atomic energy. This device seems to suit our book. It has the
                        merit of putting everything in one package, and yet is not a treaty, nor is
                        it one of those mysterious under-cover arrangements of no definable status
                        under which our atomic energy program was run during the war.</p>
                    <p>There are annexed to this paper, or minute, some reports of these sub-groups
                        of the Combined Policy Committee which dealt with the question of
                        interchange of information and with the allocation of raw materials. These
                        reports record the agreements reached on these <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690"
                            facs="0200"/>subjects. They will be discussed more fully by the
                        representatives of the Commission here present but, insofar as the State
                        Department is concerned, I may say that <hi rend="italic">the paper on
                            information</hi> sets forth a pattern for interchange which is by no
                        means disadvantageous to us; in fact it seems to be heavily loaded in our
                        favor. We stand to learn more than we give. The criterion for exchange of
                        information will be the degree to which such an interchange would promote
                        the national security of this country in the terms of the Atomic Energy Act
                        of 1946. There will be a permanent sub-committee to consider such
                        interchange. Our representatives will be Dr. Vannevar Bush<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d68fn3">Chairman of the Research and Development Board.</note>
                        and Dr. Fisk<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">Dr. James B. Fisk, Director,
                            Research Division, United States Atomic Energy Commission.</note> of the
                        Atomic Energy Commission. They will of course at all times be responsible to
                        the Commission, the Defense Establishment, and the American Side of the
                        Combined Policy Committee.</p>
                    <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">raw materials</hi> you will note that we
                        will get <hi rend="italic">all of production</hi> from the Belgian Congo for
                        the next two years. We also get a quantity of 250 tons which was enroute to
                        the United Kingdom. The formula for future allocation, which Mr. Wilson will
                        explain, will assure our operating needs for the next few years.</p>
                    <p>When we started these negotiations the British had a stockpile on the order
                        of 3200 tons. Under the arrangement which we have worked out, any idle
                        stockpile in the United Kingdom in excess of a minimum operating requirement
                        will be brought down to a small fraction of its present size. Moreover, I am
                        impressed with the fact that the quantity which is to be removed from the
                        United Kingdom under the operation of this formula will actually be
                        available to our own use and not merely stored in Canada, or split up with
                        Canada.</p>
                    <p>I think that this arrangement goes far toward satisfying a recommendation
                        made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in March of 1946 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >1947</hi>] in the early stages of our consideration of the
                            problem.<note n="5" xml:id="d68fn5">The views of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff were conveyed to the Secretary of State in a letter from the
                            Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy; for text, see <ref

                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 798</ref>.</note> The Joint Chiefs
                        stipulated that any disadvantage to the United States of the maintenance of
                        an atomic energy program in the United Kingdom could be minimized if
                        consumption were to balance imports and if the British stockpile were to be
                        brought down to the lowest prudent reserve. I think that is what we have
                        achieved.</p>
                    <p>When the British representatives arrived here to begin the talks it was
                        apparent that they were under instructions from the British Cabinet not to
                        agree to ship a single pound of the British stockpile. We were able to
                        change their minds by laying on the table very frankly the facts of our
                        situation and making it perfectly clear that no part <pb n="691"
                            xml:id="pg_691" facs="0201"/>of the Western world could feel secure if
                        the United States bomb production program was to be handicapped. Midway
                        during the talks the British representatives went back to England to present
                        the hard facts to their superiors. When they came back they were prepared to
                        reach an agreement which will have the effect of taking uranium out of their
                        country. Politically this must have been a hard decision for the British. I
                        believe we all know just how difficult since uranium has come to have such a
                        symbolic value, bound up with national prestige.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I should report that a genuine mutual comprehension and a remarkably
                        good atmosphere was established in these talks with the British and
                        Canadians. The Canadians sat on the same side of the table with the British
                        and were scrupulous members of the British Commonwealth. Nevertheless, we
                        know that they put in some good words for our side of the argument in
                        London. I think it is very important that this atmosphere be maintained,
                        and, for my part, I am very happy that now, as was not formerly the case,
                        the U.S. position with respect to this cooperation has been taken with the
                        knowledge of the individual members of this Committee, of the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff, and of the White House, and is broadly based on the combined
                        judgment of all the executive departments concerned.</p>

                            Moscow had exceeded its authority by agreeing to present to the Belgian
                            Foreign Office a draft letter from the Belgian Ambassador in Moscow to
                            the Soviet Ministry for Foreign Affairs stating that Belgium could not
                            supply uranium to Russia in 1948, but would carefully examine the
                            question with respect to 1949. Spaak had indicated that no such letter

                        </note> Spaak said he had telegraphed Belgian Embassy Moscow instructing

                        assure to Allies material indispensable development atomic energy. With
                        complete approval Belgian Government agreement was concluded <pb n="692"
                            xml:id="pg_692" facs="0202"/>so that Congo uranium was placed at
                        disposal US and UK. Agreement was still in force and Belgian Government had
                        hoped that an international agreement for control atomic energy would be
                        concluded under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commission, when concluded
                        Belgian Government would implement with appropriate legislation. Accordingly
                        Belgian Government could not supply uranium to Soviets either in 1948 or
                        1949 and there was no question of examining matter of furnishing uranium to
                        Soviets in 1949.</p>
                    <p>Asked if any new points contained in above reference to our agreement Spaak
                        replied no, his instruction to Moscow had followed exactly his statement
                        Parliament July 3 (see <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1071, July

                    <p>Though Spaak seemed disposed to drop matter there and turn other subjects I
                        asked if he could give me some idea how misunderstanding arose. He recalled
                        statement (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2034, December 24)<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d69fn5">Not printed.</note> that when Russians first
                        broached question he had replied Foreign Office would examine matter but in
                        order avoid delay in negotiations Belgian Government felt discussions should
                        be limited to subject of proposed agreement. (Department will recall that
                        later in same telegram he stated one thing he did not wish to do was return
                        a flat no.)</p>
                    <p>I asked whether Meers, Belgian delegate, requested instructions when proposal
                        was made by Russians that Belgian Embassy send draft letter. Spaak said he
                        did but that he did not await reply which was delayed in drafting and had
                        acted “precipitately.”</p>
                    <p>In order to keep conversation going this subject I inquired whether extreme
                        secrecy regarding this question could have left Meers in doubt. Spaak
                        replied this no justification, everyone knows importance uranium. He was
                        also greatly displeased with Belgian Ambassador who should have known better
                        than let Meers (whom Spaak called <hi rend="italic">fonctionnaire</hi>) give
                        way on point of such obvious importance.</p>
                    <p>Spaak said Meers had made exactly same mistake re tin.</p>
                    <p>Spaak thought uranium request was purely Soviet political maneuver and noted
                        Soviets proposed letter be kept confidential. Spaak assumed Russians wanted
                        letter to bring out some time later to use against US. Asked whom Meers
                        dealt with he said Mikoyan,<note n="6" xml:id="d69fn6">Anastas Ivanovich
                            Mikoyan, Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade.</note> who had handled Meers
                        only too cleverly.</p>

                        <p>“I have given very careful consideration to the questions which your
                            Ambassador, Baron Silvercruys, put to me on your behalf on January 19,
                            1948, and which were the subject of our conversation in October last in
                            New York. It is my understanding that (in October at least) you believed
                            that the agreements respecting uranium made between the United States,
                            the United Kingdom and Belgium during the war might be made public; also
                            that the time may now have arrived when Section 9<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi> of the Agreement<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">For text of
                                Section 9<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, see footnote 18, <ref
                                    target="#pg_681">p. 681</ref>.</note> would become operative.
                            This provision of the Agreement provides for participation by the
                            Belgian Government on equitable terms in the utilization of Belgian
                            Congo ore when such ore is used as a source of energy for commercial
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>Although I appreciate the pressures to which you are subjected and agree
                            that many details of the Agreement may already be known or inferred, I
                            do not believe that it would be prudent to make a full disclosure now.
                            For some time, and increasingly since October, the uncertainties of the
                            world situation have required stringent security measures with respect
                            to atomic energy development. If anything, it appears to me that
                            controls should be increased rather than relaxed. A disclosure at this
                            time would at the least stimulate speculation as to amounts and tempo of
                            individual ore shipments, our degree of dependence on the Congo, and the
                            relation of the Congo to the over-all procurement program. Out of such
                            speculation some details might be deduced about our bomb production
                            rates. It is just possible that some of the gaps in the Soviet Union’s
                            estimate of our position might be filled.</p>
                        <p>In any case a disclosure now would furnish the Soviet Union with certain
                            propaganda opportunities. For example, our motives would be distorted to
                            make it appear that we were backing the European Economic Cooperation
                            plan to insure our supplies of uranium.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">For

                        <p>With respect to the fulfillment of Section 9<hi rend="italic">a</hi> of
                            the Agreement, I should like to assure you that the United States
                            intends to give effect to the stipulations in favor of Belgium when the
                            time comes. However, I am informed by the United States Atomic Energy
                            Commission that we are now at a considerable distance from the point
                            contemplated by that part of the Agreement. Moreover, in the absence of
                            any agreement on the international control of atomic energy to insure
                            its use for peaceful purposes only, the primary emphasis of the United
                            States development program at the present time is on the use of ore for
                            strategic purposes. Even if this were not so, there are, I understand,
                            tremendous technical difficulties to be overcome before the use of
                            atomic energy for industrial purposes can be accomplished on anything
                            other than a token basis.</p>
                        <p>Since the signing of the Agreement referred to, the most significant
                            developments, other than strategic, have been in the production and us
                            of radioisotopes for scientific and medical research and therapy.</p>
                        <p>I believe that, in the spirit of our Agreement, Belgium could derive a
                            special benefit from consultations with us on the use of these
                            isotopes.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that discussion among representatives of our two
                            governments and selected technical personnel would be helpful in
                            developing the means of sharing this type of benefit with you to the
                            fullest possible extent within the limit prescribed by our law and
                            common security. At the same time we should be able to give your
                            representatives a clearer idea as to the nature and difficulty of some
                            of the problems which must be solved before there is any prospect of the
                            utilization of atomic energy for commercial purposes.</p>
                        <p>I believe I should, in all frankness, refer to one point which might
                            present some difficulty. I am informed that some members of the
                            Communist party occupy executive positions in the Belgian atomic
                            research program. You can appreciate that as long as this is true it may
                            make it somewhat harder to convince our people that an exchange of
                            information is in the national interest. I believe, therefore, that when
                            we hold the talks suggested, it would be advisable to have before us
                            some description of any such persons known to you, and the positions
                            they hold, so that we can consider what measures need be taken to insure
                            security of information.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I should like to renew to you my sincere appreciation of
                            the steadfast manner in which you and the Belgian Government have
                            cooperated in the execution of our agreements.”</p>

                                    Act; therefore, it is not clear that she would be required to
                                    enter into a bilateral agreement containing any conditions.
                                    Accordingly the amendment may not even touch Switzerland. Sweden
                                    derives relatively little benefit from the European Cooperation
                                    Act. It is conceivable that these countries would actually
                                    reject or limit participation in view of this amendment. If this
                                    should happen they would increase rather than diminish their
                                    trade with Eastern Europe.</item>

                                <item>In the European press and radio the Communists are saying that
                                    the Economic Cooperation Program is in reality a device by which
                                    the U.S. bargains relief of Europe, against a continuation of
                                    our atomic monopoly. Stipulations of the kind envisaged by the
                                    amendment would give powerful corroboration to Communist

                                <item>The amendment would not produce the effect intended. The only

                                        target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> even has authority to export
                                    these materials under certain conditions. There is no export
                                    prohibition in U.S. law on any material whatsoever; there is
                                    only a system of export control under which denial of export
                                    licenses is permissive. Therefore if prohibition of export under
                                    U.S. law is made the test by which exports from participating
                                    countries are to be controlled, then the security produced by
                                    the amendment is illusory. Moreover it makes no provision for
                                    that selective application for which the system in this country
                                    is designed. The latter is flexible: For example, under it
                                    commodities A, B, and C might be shipped to country X; however,
                                    only A and B could go to country Y; and to country Z, possibly
                                    neither A, nor B, nor C could go. The amendment would hinder the
                                    development of a strong, mutually-reinforcing, economic security

                    </table>
                    <p>Mr. Gullion showed to the Senator parts A and B of the attached
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bohlen emphasized to the Senator that the chief danger presented by the
                        amendment was the possibility that it might cause Sweden and Switzerland to
                        reject or limit their participation in the economic cooperation plan.</p>
                    <p>These were the very countries to which the Soviet Union might look for
                        manufactured equipment of a possible atomic energy application; <pb n="698"
                            xml:id="pg_698" facs="0208"/>the Soviets could get little of this
                        material elsewhere in Europe. Satisfactory agreements were already in
                        existence covering disposition of any ore controlled by the <gloss
                            target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>The Senator thought that it might be a good idea to force the issue in order
                        to alert Europe as well as the Russians to the importance we attach to
                        preventing the exportation of anything to Russia capable of increasing its
                        potential in atomic weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bohlen doubted the amendment would have that effect. It would, however,
                        strengthen Communist parties and propaganda in Europe, The Senator
                        discounted the importance of any contribution made to Communist propaganda
                        which he explained would be as violent and as untruthful no matter what we
                        did. Mr. Bohlen explained that a matter of timing was involved. Once a basis
                        of economic cooperation was established, and efforts toward European unity
                        were thereby assisted and given a surer base, the time would come for
                        undertaking in concert measures of general economic defense against the
                        Soviet Union, taking into account requirements of east-west trade. The
                        position of the western powers would be stronger; they could exploit their
                        advantage of being considerably less dependent on eastern imports than the
                        east was on the west.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gullion explained the contents of some of our existing agreements and the
                        degree to which they achieved, or set a pattern for the achievement of the
                        objectives desired by Senator McMahon. He decribed some of the efforts which
                        had been made to draft some alternative language, and the difficulties of
                        including any such language in the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> bill.
                        Mr. Bohlen explained that the objections which the Department had to the
                        bill were of such nature that they could not very well be discussed openly
                        on the floor. For that reason, if the amendment were to be offered, the
                        Secretary and others thought it ought to be discussed in committee or
                        executive session.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the interview Senator McMahon indicated that he might not
                        press the amendment.<note n="1" xml:id="d72fn1">Senator McMahon withdrew the
                            amendment before it came to a vote in the Senate.</note> He would
                        consider the matter further and think what he might give as a reason for
                        renouncing the effort. Mr. Bohlen said that if there was any way in which
                        the Department could help, it would be glad to do so.</p>

                        <p>In summary, the amendment, is undesirable because it may well cause the
                            very countries, i.e., Sweden and Switzerland, in a position to supply
                            the Soviet Union with materials other than atomic ores and who receive
                            relatively little or no aid under the Act, to limit or reject
                            participation in the Economic Cooperation plan; on the other hand the
                            amendment is not necessary for the other <gloss target="#t_ERP1"
                                >ERP</gloss> countries. As explained below, we either already have
                            satisfactory agreements with respect to the disposition of ores
                            controlled by them, they are not in a position to contribute, or would
                            not contribute other materials to the Soviet program, and we have at all
                            times a powerful lever on them through our ability to cut off aid under
                            the Act. The amendment would only needlessly trouble our relations with
                            these countries. <list>

                                <item>We already have agreements with, or satisfactory assurances
                                    from, the U.K., Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands with
                                    respect to disposition of ores known to be controlled by <gloss

                                    to our own, and in any respect where it differs significantly we

                                <item>Sweden derives relatively small benefit from the Economic
                                    Cooperation Act; she has, however, agreed to inform us of any
                                    orders for equipment or material which might have possible
                                    atomic energy application. We have evidence that she will refuse
                                    to fulfill orders when we so recommend. It is altogether
                                    possible that the same arrangement can be concluded with the
                                    other <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> countries, including
                                    most importantly Switzerland. The Act gives us no strings on the
                                    latter country which receives no aid. Consequently the suggested
                                    amendment would, if anything, only irritate the Swiss and lessen
                                    our chances of getting the kind of undertaking we want from her.
                                    So far as the other <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss>

                                    would be a powerful lever in the discussions. Such a separate
                                    approach would be a better way of obtaining the objectives
                                    envisaged by the proposed amendment, than making the tie-up in

                                    such arrangements could be discussed in the framework of Western

                                <item>Belgium. The amendment would be particularly offensive to
                                    Belgium on whom we are chiefly dependent for our raw materials
                                    and who has only recently firmly rejected Soviet pressure for a
                                    uranium understanding. It would appear as an attempt to gain an
                                    advantage beyond that already secured to us by existing
                                    commitments given and taken in good faith. The position of the
                                    Belgian Government would be weakened vis-à-vis both the extreme
                                    nationalist and the Communist element. A change of government in
                                    Belgium would jeopardize our whole atomic energy ore procurement

                        development work in atomic weapons. This work was carried on, not by the
                        usual organizations charged with scientific development or experiments in
                        weapons, but by a special section of the Ministry of Supply under Lord

                        to a planned press question, that the U.K. was developing modern post-war
                        weapons including atomic weapons.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">Secretary of
                            Defense Forrestal received similar notification from Admiral Sir Henry
                            Moore on March 31 (Walter Millis (ed.), <hi rend="italic">The Forrestal
                                Diaries</hi> (New York: Viking Press, 1951), pp. 406–407.) The
                            contemplated announcement was made on May 12 by A. V. Alexander,
                            Minister of Defence, in answer to a question in the House of Commons

                        press and would restrict speculation to a minimum. In the unlikely event
                        that this result did not appear obtainable, the British might defer making
                        the projected indirect disclosure.</p>
                    <p>The Canadians as well as ourselves are being informed. The British did not
                        appear to expect comments from us, but merely wanted to put us on

                    <p>This is to suggest that, after checking with Secretary Forrestal, you say to
                        Spaak sometime during his current visit that we are gratified to see that
                        the problem of the defense of the Congo in wartime has been receiving
                        renewed attention by his government. In view of the importance of uranium
                        supplies to us, we are naturally interested. Sometime in the future we might
                        like to have our military men talk with his about the requirements of Congo
                        defense although we have no definite plans at this time.</p>
                    <p>The following is for your background information:</p>
                    <p>When Ambassador Kirk<note n="1" xml:id="d76fn1">Alan G. Kirk, United States
                            Ambassador in Belgium.</note> last conferred with General

                            Eisenhower, Chief of Staff, United States, Army, November 1945–Fehruary
                            1948; President of Columbia University.</note> the latter did not seem
                        aware of any special Congo planning by the War Department. Doubtless there
                        are such plans but they were not then in the forefront of the Chief of
                        Staff’s mind.</p>
                    <p>The Staff talks would be entirely without commitment on anyone’s part, but it
                        is obvious that the Congo is a prime objective of airborne <pb n="704"
                            xml:id="pg_704" facs="0214"/>operations in wartime, and that we are not
                        necessarily in the most advantageous position in this respect. Arrangements
                        for counter-intelligence and counter-sabotage might also be discussed.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that such talks should be held whether or not we move to a
                        closer relationship to the Western European union.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d76fn3">For documentation on discussions leading to the

                        with the Belgians might be brought into relation to it. Of course, the
                        British also have a great stake in the Congo and have defense installations
                        somewhat nearer than our own. Presumably we should coordinate any further
                        action with them.</p>
                    <p>As you may be aware, circumstances for such talks are more auspicious now
                        than previously. In the near future the Western European Ambassadors,
                        including our own, will visit the Congo on Belgian invitation; the Belgians
                        have announced that they are improving their defense preparations in view of
                        the probable installation of the Government in the Congo in the case of
                        hostilities; Field Marshal Montgomery<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">Viscount

                            forthcoming trip to Congo.” In telegram 1222, June 14, however, Kirk
                            reported that Edgar E. B. Sengier, Chairman of the Executive Committee
                            of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, had advised him not to visit the
                            Congo uranium mines due to the likelihood that undesirable publicity and
                            unfortunate precedents would be created. Concurring in this opinion and
                            believing that a visit to Leopoldville only would not justify his
                            absence from Brussels, the Ambassador stated that he was discontinuing
                            his plan to go to the Congo. (855a.6359/6–1448)</note>

                    <p>The Government of the United States and the Government of the United Kingdom
                        have consulted with respect to the option privileges included in Clause 5 of
                        the agreement. The two governments have agreed that notice should now be
                        given that it is desired to exercise the option to extend the agreement for
                        an additional period of three years and the Acting Secretary of State has
                        the honor on behalf of the United States Government hereby to give notice to
                        this effect.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador is no doubt aware of the desirability of obtaining the fullest
                        information possible with respect to the reserves of monazite in the
                        Netherlands East Indies and the potentialities for production from such
                        reserves. With this in view, the Acting Secretary of State presents for the
                        consideration of the Government of the Netherlands, a proposal for a field
                        investigation of the monazite reserves of the islands of Billiton, Banka and
                        Singkep by three qualified mineral engineers of the United States
                        Government. This proposal is made with the full knowledge and concurrence of
                        the Government of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States proposes that the actual field work
                        should be performed in cooperation with the Netherlands authorities in a
                        manner to be agreed among the three governments. Unless the Netherlands
                        Government should recommend otherwise, the United States Government believes
                        that the work can best be performed on an overt yet discreet basis. With the
                        cooperation of the Netherlands Government and the private companies
                        operating in the specified areas, it is anticipated that these field
                        investigations could be completed in about three months, provided that any
                        data now in the hands of the mining companies, pertinent to an evaluation of
                        the reserves and possibilities for production of monazite in the <gloss

                        reasonably well in advance of its departure from the United States. It is
                        appreciated that information relating to monazite may be intrinsically
                        linked with the confidential operating data of the companies regarding tin,
                        and the United States Government hereby gives assurance that all
                        information, which may be made available to it, will be kept in the
                        strictest confidence.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States, consistent with the spirit of the
                        agreement of August 4, 1945, is, of course, prepared to keep the Netherlands
                        Government fully informed regarding the progress of <pb n="706"
                            xml:id="pg_706" facs="0216"/>the investigations and, when the field data
                        have been compiled, will undertake to supply the latter with copies of the
                        final reports.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary of State would appreciate receiving the views of the
                        Netherlands Government regarding this proposal at the earliest convenient
                        time. In this connection, attention is called to the commencement of
                        meetings of the International Tin Study Group in Washington on April 19,
                        1948. It would be helpful if sometime during these meetings, or following
                        them, the representatives of the Netherlands East Indies mining companies
                        who will attend could discuss with the designated United States engineers,
                        arrangements with respect to compilation of data essential to the success of
                        the investigations.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday in conversation with Foreign Minister<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3"
                            >Raul Fernandes.</note> he stated orally that Brazilian Government
                        considered present agreement (1) illegal and (2) unenforceable.</p>
                    <p>He asserted it was illegal because it was secret and had never been ratified.
                        He remarked that even Vargas<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">Getulio Dornelles
                            Vargas, President of Brazil 1930–1945; National Senator since

                        agreement and had not given it legality by publication in any official organ
                        the procedure followed by that regime.</p>
                    <p>Agreement was unenforceable, he said, because Brazilian Government could not
                        in absence of specific legislation compel producers or exporters to ship to
                        a specific country. He was of further opinion that should terms present
                        secret agreement become known it would cause deep resentment and play into
                        hands Communists and others denouncing foreign monopolies and exploitation.
                        He also held present prices too low.</p>
                    <p>For above reasons and also because National Security Council<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d78fn5">Reference is to the Brazilian National Security
                            Council.</note> demands revision Foreign Minister said he proposes that
                        new agreement be concluded which would be submitted Congress for
                        ratification. Suggested new agreement, he indicated, would provide that (1)
                            <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0217"/>part of production would be
                        reserved for use in Brazil, (2) sands would be treated to maximum possible
                        extent before export, (3) contract would contain escape by clause to enable
                        Brazil to comply with plan to be adopted by <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> for atomic control.</p>
                    <p>To give effect such agreement Congress would be requested appropriate
                        necessary funds to expropriate existing monazite mining concessions to
                        assure national control production and export.</p>
                    <p>In connection with expression above views Foreign Minister stated he would
                        consult with Security Council and in near future would reply in detail to
                        Embassy note.</p>

                        Government in Washington in the second week in June. The U.S. and U.K. were
                        agreed that by 1952 South Africa might be the principal source of uranium
                        and negotiations should be undertaken now to procure the maximum amount. The
                        Committee then considered the possible effect of the overthrow of Marshal
                        Smuts’ government on the proposed negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2"

                        <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0218"/>reported that the British were of
                        the opinion that preliminary talks should take place as planned. This would
                        be satisfactory if they were confined to amounts and price formulae, or the
                        elements of a straight commercial transaction, but it would be inappropriate
                        to engage in wider political discussions at this time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Wilson</hi> described the approach which the
                        representatives of the Combined Development Agency planned to make to the
                        South Africans. We would probably want ten thousand (10,000) tons within the
                        next few years, delivery to be made as soon as possible. Instead of a
                        straight unit price per pound, we would propose an arrangement under which
                        the Atomic Energy Control Board would be the principal and the South African
                        mining companies would act as agents, being paid costs plus a royalty. A
                        straight unit price per pound would be very difficult in the case of the
                        processes to be used in South Africa, since little was known of the expenses
                        involved. Moreover, the range of uranium content of the various tailings was
                        very great. A straight unit price would mean that some countries would
                        profit exorbitantly whereas others would barely make expenses. <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lovett</hi> expressed the opinion that in beginning
                        the talks the question of political concessions or of a politico-strategic
                            <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> should not be raised, unless the
                        South Africans should do so. So far, it appeared that they were disposed to
                        confine the talks to financial considerations.</p>
                    <p>In all our future foreign relations with the Union of South Africa, we would
                        have to bear in mind the importance of South African uranium.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lovett</hi> outlined some of the political and
                        strategic considerations in relation to negotiations as follows: </p>
                    <p>1. The question of political inducements, or of a politico-strategic <hi
                            rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> should not be raised, unless the South
                        Africans do so.</p>
                    <p>In the last analysis, however, the price of uranium was dependent on
                        political considerations. The South Africans, like the Belgians, were
                        willing to sell uranium to us because they felt it is in their interest
                        politically and strategically. Inasmuch as the South Africans have asked the
                        U.S. and U.K. to make an offer, and have indicated that their principal
                        interest is an assurance that we will continue to take over a long term any
                        uranium produced, it is probable that they are disposed to confine the talks
                        largely to financial considerations.</p>
                    <p>We should, of course, bear in mind the importance of South African uranium in
                        all our future dealings with the Dominion—although there do not seem to be
                        any policies which we ought to change with the possible exception of
                        facilitating South African purchases of mining machinery and rolling
                        stock.</p>

                        We should take no initiative on either question unless the South Africans
                        should raise the point. As to (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), the general
                        character of the U.S.-U.K.-Canadian cooperation could be outlined. The
                        British would feel compelled to do so, in any case, because of the
                        Commonwealth relationship.</p>
                    <p>If South Africa should insist on membership in the Combined bodies directing
                        atomic energy policy, this might eventually have to be granted, especially
                        in view of the Commonwealth bond. However, we should not advance the idea,
                        or encourage the British to do so.</p>
                    <p>There may be some advantage to South Africa in not assuming responsibility
                        for decisions in atomic energy policy which now rest with the bigger <gloss
                            target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> powers. It was better for all concerned if
                        South Africa should continue to treat the whole thing as a commercial
                        transaction. It would be easier, for example, for South Africa to deny
                        uranium to outsiders if the uranium were bound up in a commercial contract,
                        than if the government were actually engaged.</p>

                        doubtful that the South Africans would actually ask for this. If they do, it
                        may be because of over-optimism as to the imminence of industrial uses. We
                        should be prepared to give them a more correct view of prospects.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the British position in the last <gloss target="#t_CPC1"
                            >CPC</gloss> talks and their replies to a similar request from South
                        Africa, we can anticipate that they would have to grant South African
                        requests for research information, although they would probably try to defer
                        delivery and would consult with us. In the long run we should probably have
                        to agree to the construction of a pile in South Africa, but limited
                        cooperation in this direction should be offered first, i.e., assistance in
                        research (which they are already requesting), isotope uses, etc. We would
                        also want assurances as to informational security, stockpiling, etc., and
                        possibly other undertakings in fields other than atomic energy, and relating
                        to over-all Atlantic Union defense.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Senator Hickenlooper</hi>: In reply to your letter
                        of June 7, 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d80fn1">Not printed.</note> it is still
                        too early to say to what extent the recent political changes in the Union of
                        South Africa may influence the efforts of the Combined Development Agency to
                        secure raw materials from that source. Our most recent reports indicate that
                        the position of the winning Nationalist Party led by Dr. Malan is very weak.
                        They actually trailed in the popular vote by an almost 12% margin. Their
                        majority in the Parliament is only 3 to 5 seats. Moreover, to win support on
                        controversial issues they would have to rely on winning votes from other
                        parties. In these circumstances the extent to which Malan will be able to
                        depart from the policies of Marshal Smuts’ Union Party is doubtful.</p>
                    <p>Certainly there has been no evidence of a change in policy thus far with
                        respect to uranium. The question of “a diplomatic arrangement which would
                        permit the Atomic Energy Commission to purchase uranium concentrates” has
                        not yet actually arisen. So far the negotiations with the South African
                        representatives (Brigadier Schonland and Professor Tavenner) have been
                        purely exploratory. There is no evidence that anything will be required
                        other than a straight commercial contract between the Combined Development
                        Agency and a comparable corporate entity in South Africa.</p>
                    <p>The South African representatives came to this country via London where they
                        made preliminary contacts with the United Kingdom authorities. During the
                        week of June 7 they held some meetings with United States and United
                        Kingdom, representatives of the Combined Development Agency, which were
                        attended by personnel of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Embassies, and an
                        observer from this Department. The South-Africans began these talks by
                        affirming that they did not consider that the change in government affected
                        their mission, which was exploratory and factfinding. Their report would be
                        transmitted to Pretoria and the next stage would presumably be tripartite
                        negotiations in South Africa after their government had considered that
                        report.</p>
                    <p>As a result of the talks here, the South Africans are taking with them an
                        outline of the prices, quantities, and terms on which the Agency would wish
                        to secure South African uranium. I believe that the Commission can furnish
                        you with complete details. It is understood that these preliminary talks are
                        not binding on either party.</p>
                    <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0222"/>
                    <p>It may be that the South African government may eventually wish to make
                        stipulations of a political character or ask for compensations other than
                        financial, although, I repeat, there has been no sign of this thus far. We
                        strongly believe that it is to the interest of all concerned if the
                        arrangement can be concluded within the terms of an ordinary commercial
                        contract. However, if we have to, we would be prepared to consider some kind
                        of diplomatic agreement in consultation with the appropriate committees of
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>We do not know whether the accession of the violently Nationalist Malan
                        government will facilitate or hinder a commercial agreement. Dr. Malan,
                        himself, favors the separation of South Africa from the British
                        Commonwealth. However, the narrowness of his majority will undoubtedly limit
                        what he can do in this respect, especially since we learn that General Smuts
                        has now decided to accept an opposition seat and will doubtless combat such
                        policies. On the other hand, the Afrikaaners’ separatist policy may cause
                        South Africa to view a joint uranium agreement with the United States and
                        United Kingdom, in a somewhat different light than if it were an
                        enthusiastic member of the Commonwealth. I should add that although Malan is
                        likely to be lukewarm on the Commonwealth affiliation, he and his party are,
                        if anything, more violently opposed to Communism than the United Party.</p>
                    <p>As you will observe, we are still proceeding step by step in this matter,
                        although the outlook seems favorable. I shall certainly keep you informed of
                        any future foreign policy aspects of the negotiations.</p>

                        to going ahead with the recommendations relating to Norway and Denmark, if

                    <p>I understand that the Atomic Energy Commission is on the point of asking this
                        Department to undertake negotiations with Sweden looking to the purchase by
                        the United States of as large as possible a proportion of Swedish production
                        of uranium. I understand that the results obtained in the pilot plant near
                        Stockholm of production of uranium from oil shale have been gratifying and
                        that Sweden is potentially the second largest producer of uranium in the
                        world. Sweden is endeavoring to purchase equipment in this country to
                        increase her production of uranium and we are sitting on these applications
                        for export licenses. I am told that Sweden can, even without our assistance,
                        produce large quantities of uranium but that her production would be
                        expedited and facilitated if she obtained this equipment.</p>
                    <p>It seems clear to me that we must fit this uranium question into our general
                        policy with regard to Sweden. The enclosed draft paper of the National
                        Security Council does not take this into account. In these circumstances I
                        make the following specific recommendations: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>That we informally ask the Atomic Energy Commission to expedite
                                their studies and to give us as soon as possible whatever
                                recommendation they wish to make in regard to our endeavoring to
                                purchase uranium in Sweden.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>That if these recommendations call for unilateral action by the
                                United States, we try to persuade the Atomic Energy Commission to
                                agree that this matter should be a joint US–UK project and that
                                whatever requests we make of Sweden should be sponsored by both the
                                US and the UK Governments.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>That we discuss the uranium matter and the whole Swedish policy
                                with those officials of the UK Government in Washington who deal
                                with uranium and questions pertaining to Western Union (one or two
                                British officials deal with both subjects) and that we endeavor to
                                arrive at an agreed course of action in regard to efforts by our two
                                Governments to cause Sweden to abandon its attitude of neutrality
                                and to sell uranium to the US and the UK. The interests of the US
                                and the UK Governments are identical in regard to both of these
                                objectives and it should be possible to work out a line of procedure
                                which meets the approval of both Governments.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>That we inform the National Security Council that we are in accord

                                to Norway and Denmark but that we feel that action in regard to
                                Sweden should be postponed pending a decision in regard to the
                                important question of Swedish uranium; that it would be agreeable to
                                us for the National Security Council to proceed with the
                                recommendations on Norway and Denmark alone or postpone action for
                                the present on the entire paper with the understanding that pending

                        with the various European countries on atomic energy matters. Specifically
                        the question has been whether the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> should

                        countries not to export equipment of use in the field of atomic energy
                        production to non-<gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> countries. It is the
                        view of this Department that the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> should
                        not take primary responsibility in this matter but that the Department

                        controls over materials and equipment distinctly of atomic energy

                        and the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> will work out understandings
                        regarding the specific items to be controlled through their respective

                    <p>The reasons for this view are several: <list>

                            <item>In our view, to attempt to use the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> as a club to force the nations of Europe to
                                prohibit the export of certain atomic energy equipment would give
                                considerable support to Communist propaganda that the United States
                                is attempting to fasten an atomic monopoly on the world. For this

                                already been obtained. In such cases the club of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> is not necessary. Arrangements for

                            <item>In certain other countries, particularly Sweden and Switzerland,
                                the inducements of the foreign assistance program are minor. In
                                these cases tying atomic energy export controls to the recovery
                                program would cause considerable irritation, and might indeed,
                                jeopardize even their limited participation in <gloss

                                atomic energy field. As far as Sweden is concerned, we have had
                                several specific cases where the Swedes, at our request, have denied
                                export licenses of atomic energy equipment to Curtain areas. Steps
                                are being taken to prevail upon the Swiss to the same end.</item>

                            <item>Decisions as to whether particular pieces of equipment in the
                                particular country should be allowed export licenses must be handled
                                on an individual basis. Considerable technical knowledge is
                                required, knowledge of the sort which is possessed at the present
                                time in this Government only by the Atomic Energy Commission.
                                Furthermore, the handling of export policy is intermingled with
                                various other approaches that this Department has in train such as
                                the procurement of raw materials and intelligence aspects of atomic

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Doc</hi>: In considering our policies toward
                        Sweden, we must at all times recall that it is, both relatively and
                        absolutely, an important potential source of uranium. When and if present
                        pilot processes of extraction from oil shale are executed on an industrial
                        scale, Sweden will probably be in the second or third rank of producers of
                        uranium concentrates. Moreover, we have certain other important atomic
                        energy desiderata in Sweden.</p>
                    <p>It is yet too early to say whether these facts will influence our efforts to
                        get Sweden to budge from its “neutral” position. However, I should like you
                        to have a recapitulation of our atomic energy interest now, to be sure that
                        we do not lose sight of it.</p>
                    <p>I also enclose for your information a copy of a note from the Swedish Foreign
                        Office of September 11, 1945,<note n="1" xml:id="d83fn1">For text, see <ref

                                target="frus1945v02#pg_47">47</ref>.</note> in response to our
                        efforts during the war to acquire any potential Swedish production. In it
                        the Swedes announce their intention not to permit any uranium exports to any
                        destination. A summary of our negotiations with them is also transmitted.
                        You will observe from these accounts that even in 1945 the Swedish attitude
                        toward our requests was determined by their neutrality concepts and their
                        fear of the Soviet Union; then as now Unden<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Östen
                            Undén, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> was the spokesman.
                        However, since then, other conditions which shaped the negotiations have
                        altered considerably: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The prospects for
                        international control of atomic energy have diminished almost to the
                        vanishing point; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) although the United States is
                        not <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0227"/>in a position to give defensive
                        assurances to the Swedes, something like that result would be measurably
                        nearer if a Western collective defense organization in conformity with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter were established, and if the
                        Swedes and the United States were members, or affiliates.</p>
                    <p>The following are our atomic energy objectives in Sweden, briefly stated: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The Department and the Atomic Energy Commission are now
                                considering whether we should approach the Swedes for as much
                                uranium as we can get, or whether our interest is best served by
                                maintaining a low level of production in Sweden and continuing
                                present arrangements, including transmission to us by Sweden of
                                information about their processing of oil shale. In any case we will
                                shortly begin by asking the Swedes for information about the
                                purposes and progress of their project. We may contend that such
                                cooperation was provided for in the 1945 talks. Sweden is
                                potentially an extremely important source of uranium concentrate.
                                Her production might compare with that of any one country under USSR
                                control. At the time when we first approached the Swedes in August
                                1945 with a view toward procuring some of this ore, the possibility
                                of Swedish methods for the treatment of oil shale had not yet been
                                established. It now appears that this method is feasible and on the
                                way toward realization. It might be argued that it would be to our
                                interest not to encourage production in Sweden. The answer will
                                depend on how much we need the uranium. We should also recall that
                                Swedish science and resources are adequate to enable them to produce
                                it on their own account within a short time. We do not believe,
                                however, that they would attempt to produce large quantities or that
                                they would go further and attempt to construct in Sweden large-scale
                                atomic reactors on the Hanford<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Reference

                                beyond their means and, in any case, would be a temptation to an

                            <item>Sweden is one of the few countries in a position to export items
                                of industrial equipment suitable for atomic energy applications. As
                                you know Sweden has already indicated some willingness to cooperate
                                with us in this matter (which was foreshadowed in the September 1945
                                talks) and has on two occasions stopped orders on shipments at our
                                suggestion. In the near future you will receive an extensive list of
                                items for which we will suggest that the Swedes institute a special
                                export control. It would be possible to claim that the Swedes have
                                an obligation to institute this control under the terms of Section
                                117–D of the Economic Cooperation Act, but we consider that for the
                                present this would be unnecessary and undesirable for a number of
                                reasons which, I am sure, are obvious to you. Similarly subsection 9
                                of Section 115–B might be held to give us some special privileges
                                with respect to the uranium process. However, in the course of the
                                negotiations with respect to our agreement with the Swedes on August
                                5, the Swedes gave us oral assurances that they would furnish
                                information <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0228"/>on their

                    <p>As I have indicated, the relation of these atomic energy questions to our
                        policy on Swedish “neutrality” is not yet clear. The National Security
                        Council paper<note n="5" xml:id="d83fn5">For information on the document

                        yet take account of uranium procurement.</p>
                    <p>I believe that your effective efforts have already made very clear to the
                        Swedes (and their concern is evident) our disapproval of their neutrality
                        policy. However, if we are to make a request for uranium it would be
                        unfortunate, if the Swedes had been forced into a reaffirmation of their
                        neutrality position so categoric as to preclude their making it available to
                        us. On the other hand, an ill-timed request for uranium might merely result
                        in strengthening Sweden’s “neutrality” inclination. In any case, I do not
                        believe that relaxation of our pressure is feasible, desirable or that it
                        would advance our chances of getting uranium.</p>
                    <p>Until such time as we know what we will ask with respect to atomic energy
                        development and procurement in Sweden and until this objective is fitted to
                        over-all policy formulations, such as that embodied in the National Security
                        Council paper, I would propose that we consider export from this country of
                        items in the atomic energy field apart from the general restriction on
                        military exports. For the present, relatively unimportant items only would
                        be approved; but we have on hand applications for items of importance in
                        atomic energy development and which indicate serious progress in Sweden. Our
                        action on these will be determined with reference to our decision on
                        procurement but in the meantime you may be asked to verify the background
                        and affiliations of prospective consignees.</p>
                    <p>If we do make a uranium bid and if it is turned down it would give us cause
                        for increased vigor in our campaign on Swedish neutrality. It seems to me
                        that the Swedes may now claim that their estimate of the effect of Swedish
                        neutrality on world security is at least entitled to as much credence as
                        ours, or put another way, that it is a matter of <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719"
                            facs="0229"/>opinion whether our interests are best served by their
                        staying on the fence. However, a request for uranium is a demand for a
                        definite contribution by the Swedes, the significance of which they would
                        have to recognize.</p>
                    <p>I should be grateful for any views you may have or suggestions for putting
                        the uranium problem into its correct perspective.… We have now made
                        arrangements with the Commission, as well as budgetary provision, for the
                        nomination of a Scientific Attaché to Stockholm who is now being selected,
                        pending confirmation by you of his acceptability to Swedish Government. He
                        should be of considerable help in this field. You will have already
                        received, or will shortly receive, a cable about this.</p>
                    <p>However, I want to be sure that our missions are at all times cognizant of
                        the political aspects of atomic energy. I should be glad to hear from you
                        currently and directly on these subjects at any time.</p>

                        Gullion as his Special Assistant and as American member of the Combined

                        stated that his appointment was temporary and that in October he would be
                        replaced by Mr. Webster. The new Ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, was
                        replacing the retiring Ambassador, Lord Inverchapel, as a British member.

                    <p>The allocation arrangements provide that when the United States warehouse

                        shipment of a quantity equivalent to the deficit will be made from the
                        United Kingdom. A balance of each year would be struck in the third quarter
                        taking into account the earmarkings of the first and second quarters and the
                        anticipated situation for the remainder of the year. Actual shipments take
                        place as required in the fourth quarter. The amount earmarked in the first

                        Dr. O. M. Solandt, a Canadian, whose comments had been very reassuring
                        concerning the prospects for successful negotiation with South Africa. Dr.
                        Solandt stated that Mr. Schonland would probably represent the new
                        government. Being strongly anti-communist, South Africa would be anxious to
                        place its material in the hands of those who could make best use of it in
                        the fight against communism.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">The Chairman</hi> spoke of the excellent cooperation we
                        had had from the Belgians. Mr. Spaak has been a tower of strength but it had
                        to be recognized that he was faced with a difficult situation at home and
                        that we should do whatever could appropriately be done to strengthen his
                        hand. The solution seemed to lie in talking with the Belgians about
                        production and use of radioisotopes and discussing the present status <pb
                            n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0231"/>of power production possibilities
                        without going into much detail about industrial processes. There was
                        evidence that the Belgians would consider some arrangements on isotopes a
                        satisfactory prop for their domestic position. Moreover, with conversations
                        in progress Spaak would be able to turn aside embarrassing interrogation
                        from either the extreme right or the communists. It was not anticipated that
                        Belgians would require much from us at this stage.</p>
                    <p>In this connection <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lilienthal</hi> reported that the
                        Commission is making a fundamental reexamination of the entire problem of

                        on the Belgian negotiations and others as well.</p>

                        plutonium production program which in their opinion looked toward production
                        of weapons.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Reference is to the visit to Britain

                        this information to the matter of future technical cooperation with the U.K.
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">The Chairman</hi> stated that the question of
                        plutonium production had not been raised in the December–January discussions
                        but that in his view it was not assumed on our side that the British would
                        not produce weapons. That they would was confirmed when the British told the
                        Department of State on March 19<note n="6" xml:id="d84fn6">For Gullion’s

                        last year they had been doing research and development work on atomic
                        weapons. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lovett</hi> recalled that we had
                        undertaken the recent negotiations because of our great need for raw
                        materials. In this connection, it was important to clear up past
                        misunderstandings in order to secure the cooperation of the British in the
                        forthcoming negotiations with South Africa. Moreover, our scientific and
                        technical advisers were of the opinion that cooperation in certain technical
                        areas would further the national defense and security of this country. In
                        the field of raw materials our objectives have been achieved most
                        handsomely. In his view the information called to the attention of the
                        Secretary of State and <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0232"/>the
                        Secretary of Defense should not in any way affect existing arrangements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Carpenter</hi> raised the question whether U.K.
                        weapons production would in effect deny us raw materials. <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Mr. Wilson</hi> replied that the five year estimate of
                        U.K. needs on which recent allocations had been based was intended to cover
                        all aspects of the U.K. atomic energy program. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr.
                            Carpenter</hi> said that he mentioned this matter briefly to Secretary
                        Forrestal. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Carpenter</hi> stated his own view to be
                        that the information contained in the Commission’s letter should not in any
                        way affect existing arrangements and was not inconsistent with projected
                        military plans in so far as they related to Western Union.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">The Chairman</hi> pointed out that conversations had
                        just been begun with members of Western Union and Canada to see what
                        arrangements, both political and military, could be made to give strength to
                        Western Union. It was hoped that on the military side arrangements could be
                        made for standardization of arms and for combined strategic planning. If and
                        when the U.K. has atomic weapons, the military staffs might appropriately
                        consider what disposition should be made of them in accordance with agreed
                        over-all strategic plans. The U.S. was going into these conversations with
                        Canada as a partner. It might prove possible for the U.S. and Canada to
                        persuade the U.K., if strategy so dictated, to place her stocks of bombs in
                        Canada. That was quite different from an attempt by us to tell the U.K.
                        unilaterally what she ought to do with the bombs.</p>

                        he was not in a position to give a final answer on the attitude of the
                        National Military Establishment towards expanding the area of exchange of
                        information, except to note that nothing should be agreed upon with the
                        British which would diminish security of secret information or would reduce
                        raw material supplies to the United States.</p>
                    <p>The consensus of the Committee was that cooperation should continue as
                        presently laid down. No initiative should be taken by the U.S. to add to the
                        nine agreed areas of technical cooperation. If, however, the British made a
                        formal approach to this effect the Committee should seriously consider doing
                        so, subject, of course, to discussions with appropriate Congressional
                        committees. In any event, this should come after arrangements on Western

                        that, taking into account the forthcoming debates in General Assembly
                        concerning negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss>, the
                        present tensions in the world, and the danger that such an announcement
                        might prove a severe shock to certain friendly powers, whatever publicity
                        was agreed upon should not be in the form of a joint communique but might
                        come out unobtrusively in public speeches. The most natural way to handle
                        the matter would be for Mr. Lilienthal to cover the substance of the draft
                        release as part of a speech on some general topic relating to atomic energy;
                        His speech would be followed by appropriate speeches or replies to
                        parliamentary questions by British and Canadian officials. Concerning the
                        text of the draft itself, he felt that the term “Declassification

                        theme of intellectual and cultural cooperation with the United Kingdom and

                            Accord</p>
                        <p>As the Committee is aware, Mr. Spaak on behalf of the Belgian Government,
                            has several times asked for assurances with respect to the intentions of
                            the U.S. and U.K. Governments in implementing Section 9<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi> of the agreement of September 26, 1944, which provides for
                            participation by the Belgian Government on equitable terms in the
                            utilization of Belgian Congo ore when such ore is used for commercial
                            purposes. It is apparent that Mr. Spaak needs something of the kind to
                            strengthen his hand vis-à-vis both the nationalistic and Communist
                            elements in Belgium. On January 19, 1948, the Belgian Ambassador at
                            Washington, on behalf of Mr. Spaak, asked the Secretary of State whether
                            the agreements respecting uranium might now be made public and whether
                            the time had now arrived when Section 9<hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the
                            agreement would become operative.<note n="7" xml:id="d85fn7">For the
                                Belgian note of January 19, see <ref target="#pg_687">p.
                                687</ref>.</note> In oral elaboration of his remarks the Ambassador
                            suggested that even if atomic energy were not now practicable for
                            beneficial applications, nevertheless there might be studies in progress
                            in which the Belgians could usefully participate, within the spirit of
                            the Belgian-U.S.-U.K. Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary’s reply to the Belgian’s inquiries is attached.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d85fn8">The reply is contained in telegram 348 to Brussels,
                                March 9, <ref target="#pg_693">p. 693</ref>.</note> In brief, this
                            Government did not consider that disclosures about the agreements should
                            be made at that time. With respect to fulfillment of Section 9<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi> of the Agreement, the Secretary reiterated that
                            the U.S. intended to fulfill its obligations but that the era of
                            commercial applications <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0237"
                            />envisaged by Section 9<hi rend="italic">a</hi> was still remote. We
                            did, however, perceive that there might be some special benefit to
                            Belgium in consultation on the use of radioisotopes. The Secretary
                            suggested that the Belgians send scientific representatives here to
                            discuss informally developments in the production and use of these
                            isotopes, and also indicated that this Government should be able to give
                            the Belgian representatives at that time “a clearer idea as to the
                            nature and difficulty of some of the problems which must be solved
                            before there is any prospect of the utilization of atomic energy for
                            commercial purposes.”</p>

                            the Belgians it is now planned that there will be informal scientific
                            consultations in Washington in the latter part of August. He appeared to
                            understand and to approve the range of the projected talks. He indicated
                            that in confirming the Secretary’s letter the Belgians might attempt
                            some formulation of their informational requirements. This communication

                        satellites for the development of atomic energy therein for military
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>As you will note from the enclosed memorandum, Sweden is at present engaged
                        in a modest program of development of atomic <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729"
                            facs="0239"/>energy for her own economic needs. I understand the cost,
                        both in money and in manpower, of any sizeable military program would be far
                        beyond Swedish possibilities, even should Sweden desire to embark on such a
                        program. (And I believe the Swedes are well aware of the temptation to the
                        USSR involved in any such important development program.)</p>
                    <p>As to Swedish cooperation, I think we can at present count on it in two
                        respects: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Sweden will not export to Russia or her satellites any equipment
                                which we can show is important to Soviet development of the atomic
                                bomb. (Both in the case of the ceramic kilns for Czechoslovakia and
                                in the matter of Swedish guarantee against re-export of molecular
                                diffusion pumps we have two examples of prompt and complete Swedish
                                cooperation on this.)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Sweden will live up to the oral commitment made in 1945 and
                                furnish us with such information as we may require concerning her
                                own development program.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>I now come to the nub of the question, namely, the possibility that our own
                        uranium supply problem may compel us to ask Sweden for uranium. I see no
                        likelihood that as of today Sweden would comply with such a request. As the
                        enclosed memorandum states succinctly, “The <hi rend="italic">sine qua
                            non</hi> for the procurement by the United States of Swedish uranium is
                        the definite abandonment by Sweden of her neutrality policy.” Though, as my
                        telegrams have shown, Swedish thinking on neutrality has evolved somewhat
                        and may evolve further after the September elections, Sweden is <hi
                            rend="italic">still</hi> emphatically neutral minded.</p>
                    <p>I have hammered home to the Department in my many telegrams (almost, I fear,
                        to the point of “diminishing returns”) my conviction that Sweden will only
                        abandon neutrality if she is convinced that the risk of material harm to
                        Sweden of sticking to neutrality will be greater than its abandonment. If
                        this question of Sweden’s atomic energy role is really as important as your
                        letter implies, I hope you will reread my letter to you of March 23 and its
                        enclosed copy of my letter of March 16 to Jack Hickerson.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d87fn2">Neither printed.</note> Also please see my telegram no.
                        828 of July 12<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">Not printed.</note> as the latest
                        of my lengthening series on the subject of withholding military equipment
                        from Sweden. The Swedes still think (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the United
                        States is in no position to give prompt military aid anyway, (<hi
                            rend="italic">b</hi>) the United States is just as apt to come to
                        Sweden’s defense whether Sweden retains its neutrality policy until actually
                        invaded or not, and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Sweden can obtain just as
                        much equipment from the United States and Britain to strengthen its defense
                        now <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0240"/>whether she remains neutral or
                        whether she associates herself with Western Powers. That is why it is so
                        important to my mind from the point of view of this little corner that the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> reach an early and favorable
                        decision on the withholding of any important military equipment from Sweden
                        and endeavor to persuade the British to do likewise. Sweden must then be
                        told, sadly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> nastily, that we must save all
                        available equipment for our friends and potential allies. If Sweden does
                        abandon neutrality and does associate herself with the West, the chances of
                        our obtaining Swedish uranium would be greatly improved. As indicated in the
                        memorandum,-however, I believe <hi rend="italic">we</hi> would still have to
                        pay for the development of uranium production on any important scale and
                        furnish the necessary technical knowledge and equipment.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>In plain English, the recommendation contained in the last paragraph of the
                        memorandum means that if our need for uranium is so urgent, we must be
                        prepared to take very drastic action to modify Swedish policy. I hope, from
                        the point of view of our general policy vis-à-vis Sweden, that is not the
                        case, and that we do not at present need Swedish uranium.</p>
                    <p>I shall welcome the assignment here of a qualified “Scientific Attaché” if we
                        are going to ask the Swedish Government for technical information on atomic
                        energy. I will not take the matter up with the Swedish Government, however,
                        until I receive the telegram referred to in your letter.…</p>
                    <p>There was one sentence in your letter which I fail to understand and with
                        which I do not feel that I can concur. You say, “It seems to me that the
                        Swedes may now claim that their estimate of the effect of Swedish neutrality
                        on world security is at least entitled to as much credence as ours, or gut
                        another way, that it is a matter of opinion whether our interests, are best
                        served by their staying on the fence.” If you really believe there is
                        validity in that premise, I think I have been wasting my time in trying so
                        persistently to point out the fallacies of Swedish neutrality.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you are not being completely worn down by the load you are
                        carrying, and this carries with it my very best wishes.</p>
                    <p>Very sincerely,</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Memorandum for the Ambassador</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the information available to this office the following is pertinent
                            to Mr. Lovett’s letter of 2 July:</p>
                        <p>1. Uranium deposits in sizeable quantity do exist in Sweden:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief description of Swedish uranium resources.]</p>
                        <p>3. With no coal, only small quantities of petroleum developed from oil
                            shale and definitely limited hydroelectric resources, Sweden must seek
                            to develop any indigenous source of power and heat. The promising
                            potentialities of atomic energy are, therefore, of the utmost interest
                            to her from a purely economic standpoint.</p>
                        <p>4. With limited research facilities and appropriations, Sweden cannot be
                            expected to take an active lead in basic research. She will, on the
                            other hand, husbanding her research and development potential,
                            concentrate on the development, for Sweden’s economic needs, of
                            indigenous materials based on research made available to her by the
                            Great Powers.</p>
                        <p>5. Sweden has a pilot uranium extraction plant in operation at Kvarntorp
                            which has continually run into difficulties. Sweden plans the erection
                            of a small production plant to extract uranium from the kolm deposits at
                            a cost of <gloss target="#t_Kr1">Kr</gloss>. 500,000. Because of the
                            difficulty inherent in separating the kolm slivers from shale, kolm
                            separation will amount to 3,000 tons per annum from which the uranium
                            yield will be approximately nine tons. This quantity, the Swedes
                            believe, will be sufficient to construct one pile. The program planning
                            thereafter envisages the erection of an uranium shale extraction plant
                            at a cost of <gloss target="#t_Kr1">Kr</gloss>. 10,000,000 with an
                            uranium output of 20 to 35 tons per annum.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on specific points in Mr. Lovett’s letter:</p>
                        <p>1. Sweden can be expected to abide by the commitments made in her note of
                            11 September 1945.</p>
                        <p>2. Our interests would be best served by not approaching Sweden for as
                            much uranium as we can get at this time. Sweden’s neutrality thinking
                            has not changed and it is, therefore, reasonable to believe that
                            consistent with that thinking, Sweden will no more now than heretofore
                            favorably consider the export of uranium to any power, much less one of
                            the Great Powers whose avowed utilization of the material is military.
                            The <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> for the procurement by the
                            United States of Swedish uranium is the definite abandonment by Sweden
                            of her neutrality policy.</p>
                        <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0242"/>
                        <p>3. Sweden will likely cooperate in preventing the knowledgeable export of
                            any device or equipment suitable for atomic energy applications. It is
                            consistent with her neutrality policy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>5. The export of items from the United States in the atomic energy field
                            should be kept apart from the general restriction on military exports.
                            Since we may consider the Swedish atomic energy program to be purely
                            economic in nature, the benefits of which would accrue, in part, to all
                            of Western Europe, we should support the program as a corollary to the
                            Economic Cooperation Act.</p>

                        <p>It would therefore seem that the primary considerations in this problem
                            are: <list>

                        had been brought to his personal attention and that after studying it and
                        the Foreign Office file it was evident that a misunderstanding had arisen
                        owing to failure of his assistants accurately to incorporate his directives
                        in the draft of proposed new agreement. He stated, for example, that there
                        was no intention to permit exportation monazite sands to other foreign
                        powers. Consequently our apprehensions in this respect, though they might be
                        justified on basis <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0243"/>of new proposed
                        agreement, were in fact without basis. Fernandes indicated accordingly it
                        would be necessary to revise draft agreement and resubmit it to us together
                        with reply to our note above mentioned which he hoped might be accomplished
                        within next few days. He added that during interim period pending conclusion
                        of a new agreement the present agreement, although lapsing July 16, would be
                        considered still in effect.</p>

                            <item>Senator Vandenberg</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>The meeting was called at Senator Hickenlooper’s request to discuss exchange
                        of information on atomic energy with Canada and the United Kingdom. Senator
                        Hickenlooper stated that at the time this matter was reviewed with Senator
                        Vandenberg and himself last December it was understood that information
                        would be exchanged in 3 areas. Now, he finds that exchange is proceeding in
                        9 areas.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bush advised that this was not an expansion, but a more clearly defined
                        breakdown of the previously contemplated exchange.</p>
                    <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0245"/>
                    <p>Senator Hickenlooper stated that it was his understanding that England’s
                        primary activity was to be along the lines of power production, and there
                        was no indication of their entering into weapon production. He now finds
                        that they are actively engaged in the production of plutonium, which could
                        mean nothing to him but the production of weapons.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bush stated that it was well known to everyone last December that England
                        was already engaged in experimental work on plutonium and intended to
                        continue, and that the British Government had previously advised that they
                        were working towards the production of atomic weapons, therefore the recent
                        information was of no surprise to him. D. F. Carpenter advised that in the
                        allocation for raw materials last December it was clearly stated that
                        certain quantities were anticipated for plutonium piles in England, and that
                        this is a matter of record.</p>
                    <p>Senator Hickenlooper stated that he had just today received information that
                        Dr. Cyril Smith<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Metallurgist; Member of the
                            General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy

                        certain topics, and his instructions as set forth in a letter from Dr. J. B.
                        Fisk to Dr. Cyril Smith dated July 26, 1948,<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">Not
                            printed.</note> included exchange of information on the “basic
                        metallurgy of plutonium.” He felt that this was definitely weapon
                        information, and there was no possible justification for its exchange under
                        agreed upon procedures.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bush and D. F. Carpenter agreed that it should not be included in the
                        exchanges under Area 9.<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">“Area 9” refers to the
                            9th point of the report of the Sub-group on technical cooperation,
                            approved by the Combined Policy Committee at its meeting of January 7,
                            1948. Point 9 specified that there would be exchange of information
                            regarding general research experience with low power reactors at certain
                            laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that under the law it was clearly indicated that national
                        security should be paramount, and further that the exchange of scientific
                        and technical information is encouraged. Exchange of information for
                        industrial purposes, however, is prohibited until satisfactory international
                        controls are established.</p>
                    <p>It was recognized that the exchange of “scientific and technical information”
                        can be interpreted very broadly.</p>
                    <p>It was recognized that any exchange of information on scientific or technical
                        matters on atomic energy would aid the British in some degree in their
                        activities in the production of weapons, and that since we know that they
                        are engaged in production of plutonium, probably for weapons, we must
                        recognize that any exchange will be beneficial to them, at least in some
                        degree. This was generally recognized.</p>
                    <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0246"/>
                    <p>D. F. Carpenter pointed out that the information which we would secure would
                        well be beneficial to us. He stated that at the present time we desired
                        information from the British and Canadians on the subjects of separation
                        chemistry and heavy water pile operations and on several other subjects
                        which would be of value to us.</p>
                    <p>It was generally recognized that this type of information would be of value
                        to us and is desirable.</p>
                    <p>The question was raised as to the type of control that we had over the
                        exchange of this information. D. F. Carpenter advised that we had already
                        started in operation a procedure where the Military Liaison Committee would
                        be advised in advance of any proposed contacts, would receive full
                        information on the proposed agenda and the personnel making the contact,
                        that we would review the agenda and file objections where they were
                        indicated, also that we would undertake to send our own representatives
                        where it seemed desirable to do so, and that we would discuss the results of
                        the trip with the people involved immediately afterwards. It was felt that
                        this would give the National Military Establishment adequate assurance of
                        the proper conduct during these contacts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bush advised that up until recently he has been advised by the Commission
                        of the explicit interchanges to be conducted, and he found them to be within
                        the defined areas.</p>
                    <p>D. F. Carpenter stated that the extent of the contacts has been accelerating.
                        It started out rather gradually and has just recently become so extensive as
                        to require definite control procedures.</p>
                    <p>Senator Vandenberg indicated that he felt the responsibility of the Military
                        Liaison Committee was clearly established under the law and that their
                        authority should be exercised in this connection and that the proposed
                        procedures seemed satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Senator Vandenberg asked if it was necessary to double check the Commission
                        in all these matters, asking if we have the type of Commission that requires
                        double checking. Dr. Bush and D. F. Carpenter both indicated that they felt
                        that in this area exchange of information had been carried on satisfactorily
                        and that the proposed exchange of plutonium metallurgy was the first
                        indication of exchange beyond the designated areas.</p>
                    <p>It was stated that procedures were recognized last January for the allocation
                        of raw materials and for the exchange of certain areas of technical
                        information. A refusal on our part to continue the exchange of technical
                        information described within these areas would probably lead to ill will and
                        might serve to open up the whole subject of allocation of materials and
                        resurrect any prior misunderstandings which may have existed. This would be
                        undesirable.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Subject: British Plutonium Production</p>
                    <p>You have asked me through the Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee to
                        comment upon the recent exchange of memoranda among members of the Atomic
                        Energy Commission with respect to the “discovery” of Mr. Strauss that the
                        British are actively engaged in the development of atomic weapons and that
                        their research and development work on reactors is in the direction of
                        plutonium production. With this request I am glad to comply, for I do not
                        feel that the British have failed to abide by the general arrangements made
                        last January by the Combined Policy Committee.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that for more than a year commencing in the winter of
                        1945–1946 our close war-time relationships with the British and Canadians in
                        atomic energy matters were permitted to fall into disuse. When our raw
                        material situation became acute, we reopened negotiations with them.
                        Preliminary meetings of the American members of the <gloss target="#t_CPC1"
                            >CPC</gloss> were held in November 1947, and the entire matter was
                        thoroughly discussed. I am sure that of the persons present at those
                        preliminary meetings no one had any idea that the British would refrain from
                        either production of plutonium or the development of atomic weapons. I
                        believe that I stated at one of those meetings that the British and
                        Canadians were in fact going ahead on their own despite the fact that our
                        collaboration had virtually ceased. As a member of the war-time <gloss
                            target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> I was well aware of the extent of British
                        knowledge in this field and of their feeling that for domestic political
                        reasons, as well as in the interests of their national security, they could
                        not afford to refrain from such activities. Moreover, I have an impression
                        that by the time of the formal <gloss target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> meetings

                        the General Manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, was based on a report

                        as to the intentions of the British Government. This is particularly true
                        since although the British expressed a marked interest in deriving usable
                        power from nuclear reactors, the American members, on the basis of our own
                        experience, must have been well aware that many years of development would
                        be required in order to utilize these reactors to obtain significant amounts
                        of power.</p>

                        establishment of controls similar to those now in effect in US, pursuant to
                        powers vested in Dept of Commerce under the Second Decontrol Act of
                            1947.<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">Public Law 188, 80th Cong., 1st sess.,
                            July 15, 1947 (61 Stat. 821).</note> In connection with consideration of
                        the broader program, the question was of course raised as to whether atomic
                        energy materials should be included. As a result of discussions between
                        representatives of the Dept and <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> has expressed its concurrence with Dept’s
                        view that approaches to Govts of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                        countries looking toward establishment of suitable controls over export of
                        atomic energy items should be made separately through diplomatic channels.
                        This view based primarily on belief that since control of such materials is
                        of high security interest both to US and to such countries, and also since
                        monetary value of materials is not likely to be an important factor in their
                        foreign trade, use of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> leverage, or any
                        appearance of its use, is neither appropriate nor necessary. It is agreed
                        that Dept (acting on behalf of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>) will
                        keep <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> fully informed and consult from
                        time to time on activities re <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> items.</p>
                    <p>In order to achieve similar cooperation of all friendly countries capable of
                        supplying materials of usefulness in Soviet atomic energy development, it is
                        desired that the posts numbered 1 to 6 designated for action at the end of
                        this airgram, initiate discussions with the Govts of the countries of
                        respective assignment to ascertain 1) the extent to which these materials
                        are produced or capable of being produced in each respective country, 2)
                        whether any significant orders for delivery to Eastern Europe are now
                        pending, 3) what supervision or controls either informal or official are now
                        exercised over export of these items, and 4) whether it may be desirable to
                        offer technical assistance of <gloss target="#t_USAEC1">USAEC</gloss> to
                        delineate specific items of importance in atomic energy field. Depending on
                        the outcome of these initial discussions as reported to the Dept, the
                        various Officers in Charge will be instructed as to further required action.
                        Posts 7 through 15, for whom this airgram is sent at this time for info and
                        comment, will be instructed by the Dept at an appropriate stage regarding
                        necessary action. Issuance of these instructions will be governed by various
                        conditions including need for action and the availability of <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> technicians re 4) above. Meanwhile any
                        comments or information pertaining to the subject under reference will be of
                        interest to the Dept. France considered special case and Dept solicits views
                        of <gloss target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss> Paris regarding the advisability of
                        making initial exploration of the subject through reliable French

                        under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. There is, of course, no objection to
                        the disclosure of this list to the representatives of other govts and Dept
                        suggests that all items on List A be given frank and open discussion. As
                        objective of such discussions, it is desired that other govts institute
                        procedures over List A items similar to those now practiced by the US to
                        embargo shipment of these materials to countries in the Soviet orbit and to
                        lessen the likelihood of trans-shipment to Soviet dominated countries
                        through careful screening of reliability of consignees and of reasonable
                        requirements for such materials in the country of destination.</p>
                    <p>For the information and use of the Missions in connection with this airgram,
                        there are being transmitted under cover of a separate instruction, copies of
                        the two basic regulations of the Atomic Energy Commission specifying List A
                        items, namely Part 40 and Part 50 of Title II, Atomic Energy, Code of
                        Federal Regulations entitled respectively, “Control of Source Materials” and
                        “Control of Facilities for Production of Fissionable Material”.</p>
                    <p>List B<note n="6" xml:id="d92fn6">See footnote *, above.</note> includes
                        those items which have some general industrial application but which also
                        have utility in the atomic energy field. Export of the subject items from
                        the US are controlled by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> in
                        collaboration with the Dept of Commerce through use of the licensing
                        authority of the latter, supplemented by the voluntary compliance of US
                        manufacturers which is deemed essential to the maintenance of any close
                        control.</p>
                    <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0252"/>
                    <p>Because of the especial importance of materials and equipment on List B in
                        possible facilitation of Soviet atomic energy production program it is
                        desired that insofar as possible all exports to the USSR or its satellite
                        areas should also be completely embargoed.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that the various European govts may be unaware of the
                        significance of some of the items on List B. As it is undesirable to
                        disseminate list on wider basis than required, Dept suggests the Officer in
                        Charge be guided by the following in conducting his investigations: (1) List
                        B in its entirety is intended for the Mission’s info only, and is to be
                        handled solely by the Officer in Charge. However, at his discretion, he may
                        reveal its contents to designated officers in his Mission. (2) Individual
                        items should not be disclosed to the other Govts unless it becomes apparent
                        that a specific material or item is or potentially may be produced or
                        manufactured in the country. (3) In order to develop info without
                        unnecessary disclosure of List B items, it is suggested that the initial
                        inquiries of the Officer in Charge be of a general and broad nature and
                        that, depending on the response, he subsequently narrow the discussion
                        toward the specific List B items of interest.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>When Sir Edward Appleton<note n="1" xml:id="d93fn1">Secretary, British
                            Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.</note> was in
                        Stockholm recently he was approached by Dr. H. Sterky, Director General of
                        Telegraphs, who <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0255"/>is a member of the
                        Swedish Atomic Energy Committee. Dr. Sterky will be visiting the United
                        Kingdom some time in October for official business with the United Kingdom
                        Post Office and asked whether it would be possible for Great Britain and
                        Sweden to exchange information on the two following topics: <list>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                            <item>Protection of the civil population and troops</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                            <item>Engineering information on piles</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Dr. Sterky also told Sir Edward Appleton that the Swedes have solved the
                        problem of extraction from their low grade shale deposits, at least in
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>3. London have simultaneously had under consideration the proposal put
                        forward by the American authorities for an approach to the Swedish
                        Government about their atomic energy programme. They feel that it would be
                        preferable to keep the two matters distinct. If the United Kingdom and the
                        United States were to engage the Swedes in general discussion about the
                        respective atomic energy programmes, the point would very soon be reached
                        where the United States and the United Kingdom would have to withhold
                        information on security grounds. This might make the Swedes reticent about
                        their own programme. London feel, therefore, that a general discussion of
                        this nature should be avoided.</p>
                    <p>4. They suggest that the proposed approach to the Swedish Government should
                        be proceeded with. Their own preference would be for the United States
                        representative to refer the Swedish requests for the purchase of atomic
                        energy equipment from the United States and to say that it is difficult for
                        the United States authorities to decide whether to permit their export
                        without a general knowledge of the Swedish atomic energy programme. London
                        would like His Majesty’s Ambassador in Stockholm to be kept closely informed
                        and to accompany the United States Ambassador in his approach.</p>
                    <p>5. As to Dr. Sterky’s request, London propose at the appropriate time to
                        explain that they are unable to exchange information on the engineering of
                        atomic energy piles. As to the protection of the civil population and
                        troops, they would propose to provide such declassified information as is
                        already in fact available from public sources.</p>
                    <p>6. London would be grateful for the comments of the American authorities on
                        the foregoing.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Norwegian Atomic Energy Institute is planning the construction of a small
                        heavy water pile. Some months ago they asked London whether the latter could
                        supply five tons of metallic uranium as feed for this pile. London were
                        obliged to plead raw material shortage and stated their inability to
                        supply.</p>
                    <p>2. The Norwegians have now returned to the charge stating that they have
                        small pitchblende deposits in Southern Norway from which they hope to be
                        able to obtain from 10–20 tons of oxide in concentration of about 50%. They
                        have asked whether London would be prepared to treat this material at
                        Springfields and return it to them in the form of pure oxide, which they
                        would then put into their pile in oxide form. They would pay whatever
                        refining charge was quoted.</p>
                    <p>3. The processing of 10–20 tons of concentrates at Springfields would occupy
                        but a fraction of the plant capacity and no more than a negligible quantity
                        of the processing materials, acids, &amp;c. The Norwegians are content that
                        the work should be done at any time convenient to London.</p>
                    <p>4. London feel that, on balance, they ought to accept this proposal. The
                        Norwegians state that, if London are not able to refine for them, they will
                        be obliged, despite the expense, to build a small refining plant of their
                        own. Such a plant would be available to any foreign power which might occupy
                        Norway in the event of war. The Norwegians would not, of course, acquire any
                        knowledge of the technicalities of the Springfields plant if the work were
                        done there.</p>
                    <p>5. London wish to know whether the U.S. authorities agree with their
                        view.</p>

                    <p>On August 21, 1948, David E. Lilienthal, Chairman of the United States Atomic
                        Energy Commission, spoke at the Preview Supper for the Opening of the Atomic
                        Energy Exhibit at the New York City Golden Jubilee Exposition. His remarks
                        contained acknowledgment that the United States had continued wartime
                        cooperation with Britain and Canada in atomic energy development, in certain
                        limited areas. For information on the circumstances of the speech, see
                        Hewlett and <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0257"/>Duncan, page 289. The
                        text of the address was released as a United States Atomic Energy Commission

                    <p>The Belgian Ambassador expressed appreciation for the fact that the Belgian
                        Government had been invited to send technical representatives to the United
                        States to engage in informal discussions with qualified scientists and
                        technicians of the Atomic Energy Commission concerning (<hi rend="italic"
                            >a</hi>) radioisotopes, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) prospects of
                        commercial power from atomic energy. He felt confident that the Belgian
                        representatives would be glad to give any information concerning Belgian
                        activities in the field of atomic energy which the U.S. Atomic Energy
                        Commission might find useful. He expressed the hope that these informal
                        discussions might be “just a beginning” rather than the end of mutually
                        useful interchange of views. He was familiar with the limitations of
                        domestic legislation but felt, nevertheless, that useful information could
                        be given to his people.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed his admiration for the steadfast manner in which the
                        Belgian Government had carried out its undertakings under the 1945 <hi
                            rend="italic">1944</hi>] agreement. He hoped, too, that the present
                        informal discussions might be found profitable to continue from time to
                        time. He pointed out, however, that the McMahon Act of 1946 placed rather
                        sharp limitations on the nature and extent of information that could be made
                        available.</p>
                    <p>He expressed the view that within the limitations of domestic legislation and
                        considerations of national security it would still be possible to give the
                        Belgian representatives an accurate appraisal of the present status and
                        obstacles to be overcome with regard to power possibilities. He stated that
                        it was his understanding that some rather useful knowledge <pb n="748"
                            xml:id="pg_748" facs="0258"/>might be gained concerning radioisotopes
                        and commented in passing that it might very well one day prove to be true
                        that the most useful peacetime application of atomic energy would lay in
                        this field.</p>
                    <p>In sum, the Secretary indicated that the time had not, in fact, arrived when
                        the United States and the United Kingdom could give practical effect to
                        their undertakings under section 9(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the 1945
                            [<hi rend="italic">1944</hi>] agreement.</p>
                    <p>In commenting upon some of his experiences during the war with the Manhattan
                        Project the Secretary made evident the magnitude of effort involved in any
                        serious activity in this field not only in terms of financial outlay but
                        materials, space, personnel, and industrial capacity as well.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the talk, the Secretary suggested that if it proved
                        feasible he would be glad to receive the Belgian representatives again to

                    <p>Now that our own production programme is well launched and we are in a
                        position to make use of information received and make an increasing
                        contribution to the common effort, I should like to propose that the

                        United Kingdom on atomic energy matters should be extended to include an
                        exchange of information on atomic weapons.</p>
                    <p>2. I make this proposal in the sincere belief that United States and British
                        strategic interests and national defence policies are fundamentally
                        identical, and that a frank exchange of information on this vital matter
                        would be to our common interest. In particular, I believe that:— <list>

                            <item>Our National Defence policies are directed to the prevention of
                                war, and that the best way to do this is for both of us to be
                                strong. The atomic weapon is the greatest single source of military
                                strength in the world at present, and it is in the interests of the
                                security of the United States, as well as that of the United Kingdom
                                that both countries should develop it to the maximum of their
                                ability, and with all possible speed. The closer we can work
                                together on its development, therefore, the greater will be our
                                combined strength.</item>

                            <item>The atomic weapon which the United States already have and the
                                United Kingdom will have in the not too distant future, is likely to
                                be the greatest single factor in deciding the outcome of any future
                                world conflict. It must, therefore, play a vital part in all United
                                States and British strategic thinking; in the framing of defence
                                policy, in the shaping of strategical and tactical plans, in the
                                planning of the war potential, in the design of equipment, in the

                                weapon in war, it is vital that we should share our knowledge of it

                    <p>3. I hope that you will agree that full exchange of information on the
                        military uses of atomic energy is of fundamental importance to both our
                        countries. I realise however that such a policy, however desirable, may be
                        difficult to implement quickly. I have therefore had prepared a list of
                        topics to cover at this stage only that information which would be of great
                        and immediate assistance to our own programme. I shall be glad to know
                        whether you would be prepared to support my suggestion that an exchange of
                        information on these topics should be authorised, if I were to arrange for
                        it to be put forward in the Combined Policy Committee in the near future. It
                        would of course be understood that any information which we might receive
                        under those arrangements would be subject to special standards of security
                        which would be agreed between us.</p>
                    <p>4. The British Chiefs of Staff attach immense importance to this exchange and
                        believe that the United States Chiefs of Staff would see the force of the
                        arguments set out in paragraph 2 above.</p>

                    <p>After a final meeting at the Atomic Energy Commission at which various
                        questions arising from their trip were discussed, de Hemptinne and Gerard
                        came over to the Department with Mr. Arneson to sum up their views. Mr.
                        Arneson took the opportunity to suggest certain lines of assistance that
                        could be taken without invading classified or forbidden territory.</p>
                    <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0263"/>
                    <p>Alluding to certain questions that he had asked at the earlier meeting
                        concerning the building of a reactor in Belgium or in the Congo, Professor
                        de Hemptinne stated that his questions should not be construed as a request
                        for assistance but simply as an attempt to understand the nature of the
                        problem more fully. He stressed that his questions were purely personal and
                        were not inspired by instructions from his Government.</p>
                    <p>Both men expressed great satisfaction with the opportunities they had had to
                        get a clear understanding of the nature, magnitude, and problems of our
                        atomic energy operations. De Hemptinne stressed that the purpose of their
                        mission had been solely to this end and he felt that they now were much
                        better informed about the nature of things.</p>
                    <p>As to power possibilities, Gerard said he had hoped the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> would have rather more precise cost
                        estimates than appeared to be the case. He pointed out that, in purely
                        economic terms, power from atomic energy would in all probability be more
                        attractive to Belgium than to the United States because of the much higher
                        cost of coal. Mr. Arneson reiterated the point that had been made at the
                        earlier meeting: until the technical obstacles had been overcome and we knew
                        that a power reactor was an actuality, cost considerations would be rather
                        academic. At present the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> was
                        concentrating on the technical problems.</p>
                    <p>In summing up the trend of discussion that had taken place during their visit
                        here, Mr. Arneson suggested that the following might be done by way of
                        assisting Belgium in the field of fundamental work in nuclear physics.</p>

                    <p>Belgium might wish to consider sending qualified scientific students to
                        various colleges and universities in the United States to do fundamental
                        studies in nuclear physics. The Department and the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> would be glad to render assistance in making such
                        arrangements as might be appropriate.</p>

                            fundamental research. He queried whether the Department might use its
                            good offices to see that unnecessary delays were avoided. Mr. Arneson
                            stated that the Department would be more than pleased to do this and
                            felt that, in those cases where “sensitive” items were not involved,
                            definite improvements could be effected.</item>

                            Arneson pointed out that there were various types of research tools and
                            machines, as for example betatrons, which were not classified by the
                            Commission as “sensitive” equipment. Belgium might wish to consider
                            Whether equipment of this sort might not be useful in her nuclear
                            studies. Professor de Hemptinne apparently had not been aware of this
                            and indicated that he would want to look into the matter further.</item>

                    <p>Professor de Hemptinne referred again to the negative experience they have
                        had in attempting to get heavy water from Norway. He stressed that Belgium
                        needs for this material were small but quite essential to their fundamental
                        studies. He queried whether the United States would entertain a request for
                        small amounts of this material. Mr. Arneson inquired what amount was
                        contemplated and he replied that it would be on the order or magnitude of 10
                        liters. Mr. Arneson stated that he did not know what the policy of the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> was on heavy water but would inquire
                        immediately as to the possibilities. He added, however, that in any event
                        the Commission would certainly want specific information as to amount,
                        purpose for which sought, places where it would be used, and the personnel
                        using it. Professor de Hemptinne said he would look into the matter more
                        fully in order to make his query more precise.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the various documents which they had been given by the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, Mr. Arneson observed that every
                        effort would be made to assist in securing declassified papers for their
                        use. Should they want certain papers referred to in the abstracts and
                        bibliographies already at hand, they should not hesitate to let the Embassy
                        in Brussels know and we would expedite securing copies for them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arneson stated that owing to the Secretary’s very heavy schedule prior to
                        his departure for Paris at the end of next week it might prove difficult to
                        arrange a second meeting with him. However, he would look into the matter
                        and let them know the first part of the following week.<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>I advised Dr. Woodward that at the time of our last conversation<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d100fn2">The memorandum of the conversation under reference,
                            August 16, is not printed.</note> he assured me that weapons manufacture
                        would not commence in England without prior discussion with us. He indicated
                        that that was not his understanding, but rather that it was the national
                        policy on atomic energy matters that they should not take any important
                        steps in the development of their program without giving us notice in
                        advance, and that they felt that they had operated consistently, in accord
                        with this policy, and cited information given to us, which has been referred
                        to in previous memoranda.</p>
                    <p>He advised that he was not aware of the extent to which weapons were actually
                        being produced at present.</p>
                    <p>I asked about the U.S.-British attitude towards manufacturing weapons in
                        Canada rather than in England. He did not have an official opinion on this
                        subject, but believed that the general attitude was that England is as safe
                        as Canada. He stated that this definitely was Admiral Sir Henry Moore’s
                        attitude. He pointed out that if England had decentralized critical
                        operations prior to World War II they could not have survived. In response
                        to my question, he indicated that manufacture of the bomb in England might
                        be an important factor in the holding together of the British Empire.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the above, Dr. Woodward indicated that the door was not
                        definitely closed on further discussions along this line.</p>
                    <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0266"/>
                    <p>I expressed some surprise that the request for weapons information was
                        submitted to Secretary Forrestal,<note n="3" xml:id="d100fn3">For the
                            memorandum transmitted by Adm. Sir Henry Moore to the Secretary of
                            Defense on September 2, see <ref target="#pg_750">p. 750</ref>.</note>
                        in view of my recent statement to Dr. Woodward that there was a growing
                        attitude in this country that we should not expand the areas of exchange of
                        technical information. He advised that immediately after our last
                        conversation (16 August), he cabled England advising that we were tightening
                        up on exchange of information. This cable crossed with the cable from
                        England asking that exchange on weapons be instituted. The matter was
                        discussed in high circles in England and finally came to the attention of
                        the Prime Minister, and in spite of the information that I had given Dr.
                        Woodward and Dr. Woodward’s resulting recommendation, which was supported by
                        the Ambassador, the Prime Minister requested that the request be submitted
                        through the Military Establishment. There was an inference, however, that if
                        Secretary Forrestal indicated that he did not desire to have the request
                        made at this time, it would have been withdrawn, but Admiral Sir Henry Moore
                        considered that no such desire was expressed. Dr. Woodward asked if it was
                        our feeling that the Secretary did not wish to have the request made at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I advised that I was not aware that the Secretary had indicated that the
                        request should not be made but that I was aware that he had advised Admiral
                        Moore that this was inappropriate time to push such a decision and that it
                        would be unwise to crowd for a prompt answer.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Woodward gave us repeated assurance that information would not be
                        disseminated to the Dominions other than Canada. He advised that a military
                        meeting of the members of the Commonwealth was scheduled for next February.
                        He understood that certain members would ask for information on atomic
                        weapons. He assured us, however, that this information would not be given
                        without prior acquiesence of the U.S.</p>
                    <p>I advised Dr. Woodward that there was considerable apprehension that the
                        giving of information on weapons would weaken U.S. security; first, because
                        naturally giving information to more people automatically weakens security;
                        and second, because there was apprehension in some circles that information
                        might leak through British sources to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Woodward expressed considerable surprise at this statement, indicating
                        that he was aware that there had been apprehension in other areas,
                        mentioning specifically guided missiles, but he was not aware of any
                        apprehension on atomic energy. He assured us that atomic energy was handled
                        in an entirely different manner from all other matters, and that he felt
                        security provisions were adequate, and there was some feeling that they were
                        better than ours. He stated that <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0267"/>an
                        invitation had been extended to any of our security representatives to visit
                        England to review all aspects of their security precautions, but to the best
                        of his knowledge no representative had called upon them. He wished to issue
                        the invitation again.</p>
                    <p>He asked if there was anything further that he could do at the present time
                        in securing information for us, and we advised that we knew of nothing at
                        the moment, but would contact him further. We advised him that the request
                        was currently being studied in the Military Establishment.</p>
                    <p>We asked the urgency of a response. He indicated that it was very important
                        to them, largely from the standpoint of their preparedness activities.</p>
                    <p>I advised that there would be considerable discussion as to the merits as to
                        acceding to this request, and asked him to be prepared to give us reasons
                        why we should acquiesce. He replied that he felt that the two countries were
                        partners, that they had considerable information on the manufacture of bombs
                        anyway, that they were fully determined to proceed with their manufacture,
                        and that he felt that it would be to the interests of both countries if the
                        manufacture were guided by the latest technical information. He stated that
                        these reasons were pointed out in the communication from Sir Admiral
                        Moore.</p>
                    <p>He advised that it was not contemplated to discuss this matter at the
                        forthcoming meeting of the Sub-Group of Scientific Advisors on Exchange of
                        Technical Information scheduled for October 19th or 21st, but that it was
                        felt preferable to wait until the next meeting of <gloss target="#t_CPC1"
                            >C.P.C.</gloss> which would probably come at a later date. I agreed that
                        this seemed desirable.</p>
                    <p>I advised that one possibility might be that U.K. would discontinue
                        manufacture of weapons and that U.S. might earmark a few for use by the U.K.
                        in an emergency. This would assure the U.K. that they would have the most up
                        to date weapons available in the U.S. and would save a great deal of expense
                        and technical effort on their part. Dr. Woodward took cognizance of this
                        suggestion. He did not express a definite opinion but it would appear worthy
                        of further exploration.</p>

                    <p>We handed to Dr. Woodward a copy of the qualifying paragraph under discussion
                        which would be used in the instructions to all scientific representatives,
                        but contained in all agenda and in the definition of all areas of

                            that information specifically relating to weapons or to the <pb n="758"

                    </quote>
                    <p>Dr. Woodward concurred that it was the initial understanding at the time of
                        the adoption of the Modus Vivendi that it was not the purpose to exchange
                        technical information which would convey information to the U.K. on the
                        manufacture of weapons.</p>
                    <p>It being recognized, however, that any information conveyed to U.K. may be
                        somewhat helpful, he felt that the proposed program seemed logical, but he
                        wished to study it further and he recognized that it would be difficult to
                        interpret. He will advise us further on this subject.</p>
                    <p>He indicated that at the next Sub-Group meeting requests would be filed for
                        the establishment of two additional areas unrelated to weapons. We agreed
                        that it would be logical to file them at this meeting and for the Sub-Group
                        to make recommendations to <gloss target="#t_CPC1">C.P.C.</gloss> on this

                        was to be replaced by another representative, but that there would be a one

                        <item>Monazite is the mineral source of thorium, cerium and other rare earth
                            compounds. The mineral occurs in beach sand deposits co-mingled with
                            other minerals of industrial value including ilmenite, the source of
                            titanium oxide used widely in paints and other applications. The
                            constituent minerals of the sands are separated in concentrating plants
                            utilizing gravity and electromagnetic equipment. To extract commercial
                            compounds such as thorium nitrate and cerium compounds, it is necessary
                            to employ a difficult and expensive chemical process. Such processing is
                            now done in the U.S. and U.K., and has been done in the past in France,
                            Germany and Japan. Because of the high cost of reagents required (mostly
                            acids) and the difficult technical process used, it is doubtful whether
                            this process could be done on <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0271"

                            extracted, is used in incandescent gas mantles. The cerium compounds
                            extracted are important in the manufacture of illuminating arcs used in
                            motion picture projectors and military searchlights, also in “sparker”
                            flints and abrasives (cerium oxide) used in polishing optical

                            fissionable materials, no definite conclusions can be reached at this
                            time as to its eventual possibilities, the best views being that at
                            least as far as the U.S. atomic energy program is concerned, it will be
                            many years before thorium will be important in this field. A press

                            At present the only principal producer is Brazil, although minor amounts
                            are now produced in the U.S. and formerly were produced in the <gloss

                            formerly produced about 3,000 tons a year which was shipped to the U.K.,
                            U.S., France and Germany. In 1947 small sporadic shipments were made
                            only to the U.K. (some of which were divided with the U.S. industrial
                            concerns) but since September 1947 there has been a complete ban on

                            supply 1,000 tons of Brazilian monazite over the next two years. This
                            request must eventually be considered in the light of the governmental

                            which might appear reasonable in view of indicated British failure to
                            secure shipments of material for over a year.</item>

                            commitment to promote the establishment of the processing plant. In
                            February, 1948 the British presented a memorandum to the Travancore

                            be effective and would create ill will in India not in the best
                            interests of this country, (2) it would materially impair the progress
                            made to lift the beryl embargo, and (3) the receipt of needed supplies
                            by Indian consumers could be favorable to promoting our interests. It
                            was agreed, however, that the Embassy would make it clear to the Indian
                            officials that continued shipments of thorium nitrate to India could not
                            be envisaged unless additional supplies of monazite were forthcoming
                            from Travancore . . . . Thus our policies do lend backstop assistance to
                            the British in their negotiating efforts. (In connection with the above
                            it should be noted, there were some indications that the British
                            themselves favored an immediate stoppage of thorium nitrate shipments
                            last spring). The Department feels that unless the British achieve a
                            settlement within the next few months, the manufacturer can no longer be
                            dissuaded from embarking on its previously declared course of

                            <item>The U.K. is considerably worried about the initial negative
                                reaction which Woodward received from Carpenter and Webster on
                                September 16.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">For Carpenter’s memorandum

                            <item>In response to a query, Henderson said he was confident that the
                                U.K. military authorities were fully convinced that weapons
                                facilities in the U.K. could be defended against seizure or fifth
                                column action. In elaboration of the point, however, he said in the
                                British view the question of whether facilities could be defended
                                was equivalent to the question of whether the U.K. could survive a
                                third world war. In other words, if the U.K. went down the existence
                                of plutonium piles in the U.K. would be a secondary matter. To this
                                point I replied that such a view could well be interpreted by our
                                military authorities to means that the U.K. was willing to
                                compromise our security in the interests of obtaintaing atomic
                                weapons in the U.K. Henderson agreed that if such an argument were
                                thrown back at the British as a response to their request they would
                                be put in quite a hole.</item>

                            <item>He appreciated that in the event of the outbreak of war in the
                                near future, the U.K. would not have atomic weapons available from
                                their own efforts even if the U.S. complied with their present
                                request. He agreed that in terms of the common defense and security
                                in the immediate future a more useful solution would be some
                                undertaking by the U.S. to come to the assistance of the U.K. and
                                indeed Western Europe in the event of Soviet aggression.</item>

                            <item>If the U.S. should decide that as the price for rearming Europe on
                                conventional lines the U.K. must give up its insistence on producing
                                atomic weapons, such a condition would have to be given most serious
                                consideration by the British Government.</item>

                                    observed that the U.K. effort in this area appeared to be
                                    directed toward design of reactors for production of plutonium

                                    wasted). Accordingly the U.S. technicians did not furnish

                                <item>On August 16, Mr. Carpenter stated to Dr. Woodward, Scientific
                                    Attaché to British Embassy, that the fact that the U.K. was
                                    placing primary emphasis in their reactor program on plutonium
                                    production had caused considerable concern to the Joint
                                    Congressional Committee and as a result exchange within the nine
                                    areas would have to be carefully “policed” to ensure that no
                                    substantial amount of information on weapons was exchanged. Mr.
                                    Carpenter stated that further expansion of exchange was quite
                                    improbable. He also asked whether the U.K. had considered the
                                    possibility of carrying on their work on plutonium and weapons
                                    production in Canada. Woodward stated that the U.K. Chiefs of

                        <item>On September 16, Dr. Woodward again met with Carpenter at which time
                            Carpenter expressed concern that the U.K. had gone ahead with weapons
                            manufacture without prior discussion with the U.S. Woodward’s
                            understanding was that the U.K. had undertaken to inform us of any
                            important steps in their program. This they had done. Carpenter was
                            surprised that the U.K. had come in with their request on September 1
                                [<hi rend="italic">2</hi>] for weapons information in view of
                            Carpenter’s statement to Woodward on August 16 that any expansion of
                            areas of exchange was quite improbable. It appears that despite a
                            recommendation from Woodward and the Ambassador not to do so, the Prime
                            Minister directed that the request be submitted through the Military
                            Establishment. (Tab C.<note n="6" xml:id="d103fn6">For memorandum of

                            </note> Mr. Carpenter made it clear that he wished to have a preliminary

                            Webster (Carpenter’s successor) is anxious that the Joint Chiefs not
                            produce a completely jelled opinion which would be difficult to alter on

                        <item>Mr. Carpenter was clearly in error in stating that the British were

                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of January 7 one can find no basis
                            for exchange of information on the basic metallurgy of plutonium. It was
                            generally understood in this Government that information of substantial
                            use in the production of plutonium, and therefore of the weapon, was not
                            to be included in the areas of exchange. On the basis of the present
                            agreement, therefore, it would appear that Senator Hickenlooper, Dr.
                            Bush, and Mr. Carpenter, and finally the Commission itself, were correct
                            in excluding this phase from the areas of exchange. That this is true is
                            corroborated by the British themselves in their note of September 1 (See
                            Tab A). Appended to that note is a list of topics, the first of which is
                            entitled “Areas of Collaboration which would be of Great and Immediate
                            Assistance to our Programme for the Design and Manufacture of Atomic
                            Bombs.” The first item under this heading is “1. The metallurgy and
                            methods of fabrication of plutonium with particular reference to its use
                            in bombs.”</item>

                        <item>Whatever conclusion is ultimately reached on the British request it
                            appears evident that the decision must rest on very broad grounds:
                            whether it is in the security interests of the United States to have the
                            U.K. join forces with us on atomic weapons. Such a decision cannot be
                            taken solely on military grounds although military considerations
                            perhaps loom largest, but must also take into account our political
                            posture as well. Here the shape of our conversations on Western Union
                            would appear particularly important.</item>

                            occasions. He leaves the net impression that the British are anxious to
                            have an early reply. I have told him that it would be most unwise to
                            press too vigorously at this time for a decision. I have reminded him

                            atmosphere and the simple fact that this is a major decision to be made
                            by the Administration does not favor any quick action. There are
                            indications that this advice has been seriously received, although it is
                            too soon to tell.</item>

                        <item>It may be that if the U.K. does not see any early prospect of
                            favorable action on their September 1 request they may wish to press
                            again for a liberal interpretation of the 9 areas of exchange,
                            particularly on the basic metallurgy of plutonium. In view of the firm
                            opinions held by the Joint Congressional Committee, the Military
                            Establishment, and the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> on the last
                            item it would appear most unwise for the U.K. to press for information
                            in that field. This is the more so in view of their own admission that
                            information on this matter would be of “great and immediate assistance
                            to our program for the design and manufacture of atomic bombs.” This
                            particular item is a microcosm of the larger request and involves
                            essentially the same broad decision as to whether the United States and
                            the U.K. should enter into a full partnership on atomic weapons.</item>

                        <item>It is suggested that if the British approach you in the near future on

                            may be a long time coming, that we consider they have fully complied

                    <p>The British Ambassador prefaced that he was bringing to Mr. Lovett’s
                        attention in a paper which he would leave, certain worries of the London
                        Committee on Atomic Energy. In presenting the paper (attached herewith as
                        part of the record of the subject conversation) he explained that it was
                        purposely entitled “Note for the Ambassador’s talk with Mr. Lovett on atomic
                        energy”.</p>
                    <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0281"/>
                    <p>Before briefly summarizing the contents of the note, the Ambassador stated
                        that it was intended to convey London’s genuine worry on two points but that
                        it did not necessarily reflect the British viewpoint here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett replied that regarding the first point of misunderstanding raised
                        in the paper he could furnish some comfort. Regarding the second, he found
                        difficulty in agreeing with some statements which, in his opinion, do not
                        conform to the record.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the first point, Mr. Lovett elaborated that he thought that Mr.
                        Carpenter’s comments to Dr. Woodward may have been misunderstood. He assured
                        the Ambassador that the British had complied with their obligations under
                            <gloss target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> understandings by informing the U.S.
                        regarding their weapons program as was done by Mr. Maclean on March 19 of
                        this year. Mr. Lovett stated categorically that the British were not
                        obligated to consult with the U.S. prior to the initiation of this program.
                        He hoped that this point was now clarified and assured the British that
                        steps would be taken to avoid any further complications.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the more basic worry of the British regarding the areas of
                        exchange of information, Mr. Lovett did not think that the London position
                        was correct. To this Sir Oliver indicated concurrence, Mr. Lovett referred
                        to the note left with Mr. Forrestal by Sir Henry Moore on September 1 [<hi
                            rend="italic">2</hi>] and commented that the inclusion of the basic
                        metallurgy of plutonium as one of the items which the British thought might
                        be helpful in facilitating their development of weapons, practically
                        constituted an admission that the subject was beyond the scope of the agreed
                        areas for exchange of information. Mr. Lovett stated that he and members of
                        his staff had carefully reviewed the record of the conversations leading up
                        to the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of January 7, 1948 and nothing
                        could be found to indicate that, as contended in paragraph four of the
                        British note, information on the military uses of atomic energy were
                        envisaged as included in the nine areas. Moreover, Mr. Lovett recalled that
                        Dr. Bush’s attitude, in conversations with members of the Congressional
                        Joint Committee, was clearly one considering information on weapons as
                        outside the scope of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett, in concluding this phase of the conversation, stated that
                        discussion of these matters was an appropriate function under <gloss

                        might be helpful in clarifying the misunderstandings.</p>
                    <p>To give some background on the attitude existing in Congress and within
                        Government circles with respect to furnishing assistance to other countries
                        in the field of weapons, Mr. Lovett briefly reviewed the record regarding
                        the subject of the basic metallurgy of plutonium <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772"

                        the case, he continued, reversed the position of the General Manager and
                        sent definite instructions to the delegation then in London not to engage in
                        discussions regarding plutonium. Mr. Lovett referred to the ten-page letter
                        of explanation sent on September 24 by the Commission to the Joint
                            Committee<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">Letter not found in Department of

                        matter.</p>
                    <p>After furnishing this background, Mr. Lovett read the instruction now being
                        given to all U.S. scientists who are delegated to engage in discussions in
                        the nine areas. In view of the general attitude now prevailing in the
                        military, the Congressional and perhaps in the public mind, Mr. Lovett
                        cautioned the British not to press for a decision on their request since he
                        felt that it would not be desirable from their point of view to force the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff to crystallize the position in the negative. It might
                        also, he added, prejudice continuance of the existing areas of exchange.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett then mentioned the feeling in military circles that a British
                        weapon project would be vulnerable to Russian attack and that Canada would
                        appear to be a much safer location. He observed that although a British
                        weapon project might appear inconsistent with the British financial
                        position, that, of course, <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> should not
                        necessarily be related to the British atomic energy effort.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett asked Sir Oliver if it would not be possible for the British to
                        think of other means through which they might enhance their security rather
                        than place such dependence on an independent weapon project. Sir Oliver’s
                        reaction indicated that this would be given consideration.</p>
                    <p>At the British Ambassador’s request, he and Mr. Lovett then exchanged their
                        personal views on this matter. At the conclusion of this discussion, which
                        was much along the lines explored during the earlier part of the
                        conversation, Sir Oliver suggested as the next step he would write to Sir
                        Roger Makins<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">Deputy Under Secretary of State,
                            British Foreign Office.</note> in London to pass on Mr. Lovett’s views.
                        Sir Oliver hoped that this might serve to eliminate some of the
                        misunderstanding apparently existing in certain quarters of his Government
                        in London. It was understood that the note left with Mr. Lovett did not call
                        for an official reply.</p>

                                atomic energy questions) said that some members of the Atomic Energy
                                Commission and of Senator Hickenlooper’s Joint Congressional
                                Committee had been astonished at the concentration of British effort
                                on the production of plutonium. This reaction had arisen as a result
                                of a report made by Drs. Zinn and Weil (physicists sent by the
                                Atomic Energy Commission to the United Kingdom to obtain information
                                on British atomic energy development). Mr. Carpenter had also told
                                Dr. Woodward that he had heard that the United Kingdom were shortly
                                going to ask the Americans to extend the topics upon which an
                                exchange of information was permitted under the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >modus vivendi</hi>. Mr. Carpenter had stated categorically that

                            <item>On the 2nd of September, Admiral Moore, Chairman of the
                                representatives of the British Chiefs of Staff, saw Mr. Forrestal
                                and handed him a memorandum from the Minister of Defence in the
                                United Kingdom suggesting an exchange of information on atomic
                                weapons. In the course of their talk, Mr. Forrestal said that when
                                the Combined Policy Committee had had their meetings last autumn
                                stress had been laid on the general humanitarian aspect of the use
                                of atomic power, rather than on the military side. He also mentioned
                                that differences of opinion might arise on the American side as to
                                whether the building of a plant for the production of bombs in the
                                United Kingdom could be justified (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) in view

                                atomic energy. On the contrary, <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774"
                                    facs="0284"/>the United States representatives made it clear
                                that their programme was a military one; the British representatives
                                gave full particulars of British plans for two large piles, and the
                                magnitude of the operation made it clear that the United Kingdom
                                planned to make plutonium on a scale which, in the present state of
                                scientific knowledge, could only be for bomb production. The British
                                Government were under the impression that this had been fully
                                understood by the United States authorities. In March of this year
                                the British Embassy informed the State Department, and Admiral Moore
                                spoke to Mr. Forrestal, to the effect that the British Government
                                would shortly be announcing that they were engaged on the
                                development of atomic weapons. Neither the State Department nor Mr.
                                Forrestal expressed any concern, and, indeed, Mr. Forrestal said he
                                was surprised that the existence of such work was not already
                                publicly known in the United Kingdom as it was in the United
                                States.</item>

                                several useful exchanges of information have taken place on matters
                                originally considered to fall under Area 8 (this was one of the
                                areas about which it was agreed under the <hi rend="italic">modus

                                is concerned with the design of natural uranium reactors in which
                                the power generated is not wasted) the Atomic Energy Commission have
                                recently decided that these matters could no longer be discussed
                                under this heading. Furthermore, the Atomic Energy Commission have
                                indicated that they cannot agree that the subject of plutonium
                                metallurgy should be included for discussion under Area 6. The
                                Atomic Energy Commission at first agreed with Sir John
                                    Cockcroft’s<note n="5" xml:id="d104fn5">Director of the British

                                Cyril Smith of the Atomic Energy Commission should discuss basic
                                metallurgy of plutonium during a recent visit to Harwell. They
                                indicated that this would be covered by Area 6 but, before Dr. Smith
                                left America, the Atomic Energy Commission wrote saying that they
                                had reconsidered the matter and could no longer agree to this. The

                        Foreign Minister reiterated complete fidelity to terms of agreement which
                        expired July 16 which would be considered as in full vigor pending
                        negotiation of a new agreement. Foreign Minister fully understands our
                        objections any publicity and merely commented that “we will have to find
                        some way to handle matter under our own law”. In view what I consider to be
                        satisfactory assurances of Foreign Minister reaffirming his previous
                        statements I did not consider that it would be expedient to make the general
                        observations suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 593. I told
                        Foreign Minister that in view his reiterated assurances Brazilian Govt would
                        consider terms of agreement which expired July 16 as being fully in effect
                        until new agreement should be negotiated, that I would not raise matter

                    </p>
                    <p>In a letter dated the 11th of February 1948 addressed to Mr. Gullion, Mr.
                        Donald Maclean enclosed the text of a memorandum by the Ministry of Supply
                        of the British Government concerning the state of negotiations with the
                        Travancore Government on monazite.<note n="1" xml:id="d106fn1">Letter and
                            enclosure not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The Government of India have now replied to the British Government on this
                        subject in terms set out attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Attachment
                            not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. The Government of India’s reply shows that they attach great importance to
                        the erection of a plant for processing monazite in India with a capacity for
                        treating 3,000 tons per annum, and that while they are prepared to authorise
                        the resumption of shipments of monazite to the United Kingdom, it would be
                        an implied condition that arrangements would have to be made for the
                        erection of a plant.</p>
                    <p>4. From the point of view of atomic energy, the provisional attitude of the
                        British authorities is that, considering that thorium is not likely to be of
                        practical importance in the production of atomic energy for ten years, and
                        that, even if it does become important, the amounts of thorium required are
                        not likely to be great in relation to the known supplies of monazite, the
                        purchase of the Indian monazite in the meantime for atomic energy is not of
                        great importance. They recognise that there may be an argument for the
                        purchase on grounds of preemption but, for the same reasons, they do not
                        think that this can be regarded as of great importance. Subject to the views
                        of the United States authorities, therefore, the British authorities would
                        propose to answer the Indian Government by saying that, while they would be
                            <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0287"/>prepared to purchase Indian
                        monazite at a reasonable price, and would be happy to see the Indian
                        Government enter into any arrangement for the erection of a plant that they
                        could themselves make with Thorium Limited, they were not prepared to put
                        pressure on the firm to erect a processing plant in India and, if this was a
                        necessary condition of purchase, they would be prepared to do without the
                        monazite.</p>
                    <p>5. In this connection it should be mentioned that Thorium Limited have
                        expressed their inclination to withdraw the reluctant consent they had
                        previously given to erect a processing plant of 1500 tons capacity in India
                        (which would compete with their plant in the United Kingdom); they are
                        considering relying on other sources outside India for their monazite
                        requirements. Sir S. S. Bhatnagar, who is now in London, has given the
                        British Government a list of firms which he said were prepared to assist
                        with the erection of a plant in India. These firms included Messrs.
                            Lindsay<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Lindsay Light and Chemical Company,
                            an American firm.</note> and the German firm of Auer. The British
                        authorities do not believe that all the firms on this list would have the
                        capacity to do the job, but, from the British point of view, the next best
                        arrangement, if Thorium Limited were not prepared to do it, would be if
                        Lindsay undertook the erection. The British authorities assume that this
                        would give the United States Government some control of the output. The
                        German Auer firm would also be able to do the work. There might be serious
                        disadvantage if they were to do so since, according to British information,
                        the pre-war headquarters of this firm were in what is now the Russian sector
                        of Berlin, and they may well now be under Russian influence. The British
                        Government are now finding out what the present position is. Another firm
                        that has the capacity is the French firm La Société des Terres Rares, but
                        this firm was not mentioned by Sir S. S. Bhatnagar.</p>
                    <p>6. In considering this subject, the British Government have reviewed the
                        thorium requirements of the Agency countries and their stocks. The United
                        Kingdom has some fifty tons thorium oxide (THO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>) derived
                        from the 700 tons of monazite shipped from Travancore under the Agreement of
                        2nd April 1947.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">The agreement between the
                            governments of the United Kingdom and Travancore is not printed.</note>
                        United Kingdom atomic energy requirements are still extremely conjectural
                        since they depend on research work into the production and use of U 233.
                        According to present tentative estimates, this usage in research over the
                        next five years will certainly not exceed 40 tons of THO<hi rend="sub"
                            >2</hi>. 100 tons has been very provisionally estimated as the 10-year
                        requirement. Lindsay has a surplus of 5 tons per month THO<hi rend="sub"
                            >2</hi> which they have recently offered to the United Kingdom and which
                        the latter have refused. Assuming this <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778"
                            facs="0288"/>offer is still open, if this surplus was purchased for one
                        year, the United Kingdom could, with existing stocks, cover their probable
                        requirements over ten years.</p>
                    <p>7. So far as the British Government know, Canada has no more than research
                        requirements of thorium for atomic energy which they will hope to obtain
                        from the United Kingdom and which do not necessitate any modification of the
                        above figures.</p>
                    <p>8. The British Government have no exact information about the American
                        position but they believe that the United States Atomic Energy Commission
                        thorium requirements over the next ten years may be less than those of the
                        United Kingdom and that the United States Atomic Energy Commission will have
                        no difficulty in meeting them.</p>
                    <p>9. To summarize, the total requirements over the next ten years of thorium
                        oxide for the three atomic energy projects referred to above are unlikely to
                        exceed 200 tons (THO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>); a substantial portion of this is
                        already in hand and there should be no difficulty, the British Government
                        consider, in finding the balance from Brazil, assuming that output there
                        continues to run at the present rate of about 1500 tons of monazite per
                        annum (say 90 to 100 tons THO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>). It should therefore, in
                        the opinion of the British Government, be possible to leave Travancore
                        monazite out of account in reviewing the atomic energy programmes of the
                        Agency countries over the next ten years.</p>
                    <p>10. As regards commercial requirements, it would appear that both Lindsay and
                        Thorium Limited are relatively happy about thorium supplies though they are
                        extremely worried about cerium.</p>
                    <p>11. The picture therefore is that, over the next ten years, Travancore
                        monazite is of interest from the atomic energy point of view to the Agency
                        countries for pre-emption motives and because it may be de-desirable to
                        conserve good will against the possibility of later requirements. The
                        commercial firms are interested because of their shortage of cerium.</p>
                    <p>12. The British Embassy would be grateful for the views of the United States
                        Government on the following points: <list>

                        Government were sought regarding three points.</p>

                        prolong the negotiations in view of, (2) the desirability of maintaining
                        control over destination of Indian monazite exports, the U.S. Government
                        attaching considerable importance to preemption of monazite supplies, and

                    <p>With reference to point 5 of the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, it was

                        undertake to assist the Indians in the erection of a processing plant. In
                        this connection it was felt that Lindsay’s attitude would be inversely
                        related to the size of the required plant.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. representative agreed that the Lindsay conversations would be on an
                        “as, if and when” basis to protect the present British position vis-à-vis
                        the Indians. It was thought premature to discuss at this stage the question
                        of possible U.S. participation in an understanding <pb n="780"

                    </p>
                    <p>In the discussions which took place early this year, prior to the conclusion
                        of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, the British representatives
                        explained to the United States representatives that a New Zealand team of
                        scientists was responsible for the design of the low powered piles in Canada
                        and at Harwell. It was accordingly agreed between the United States and
                        British representatives that New Zealand should be free to construct such a
                        pile if they wished to do so, provided, of course, that adequate security
                        precautions were taken. The provision of information to the New Zealand
                        Government concerning a low energy pile was specifically provided for in the
                            <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The New Zealand Government subsequently asked the opinion of His Majesty’s
                        Government in the United Kingdom on the value, from the general Commonwealth
                        point of view, of the erection in New Zealand of a graphite low energy
                        experimental atomic pile. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom
                        have considered this matter most carefully, particularly in regard to its
                        security aspect, and the Prime Minister has now written to the Prime
                        Minister of New Zealand<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">Peter Fraser.</note>
                        expressing the view that there would be an advantage to the Commonwealth in
                        the development by the New Zealand Government of this project. Mr. Attlee
                        has added that His Majesty’s Government would be glad to assist the New
                        Zealand Government, should they decide to proceed with the project, although
                        no definite guarantee can be given that any materials required from the
                        United Kingdom would foe available at any specific time. Mr. Attlee also
                        referred to the importance of introducing adequate security arrangements in
                        connection with the project.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom consider that the above
                        information may be interest to the United States Government.</p>

                    <p>In this connection Mr. Lilienthal pointed out that the initial list of
                        subjects for technical cooperation was necessarily rather widely defined and
                        that separate topics in each of these areas would require consideration in
                        the light of the laws of the three countries. Accordingly the U.S. member of
                        the Sub-Group could not be given full discretionary authority. Mr. Makins
                        responded that it was understood that the members of the Sub-Group would be
                        guided by the restrictions of their respective national authorities which in
                        the case of the U.S. <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0292"/>would
                        presumably be the Atomic Energy Commission. It was his understanding that
                        the Sub-Group would not normally need to refer to the <gloss
                            target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> except in case of disagreement or
                        difficulty in effecting cooperation or for the purpose of seeking authority
                        to add fresh areas of information and exchange.</p>
                    <p>The Sub-Group on Technical Cooperation, as originally appointed, consisted on
                        the American side of Dr. Bush and Dr. Fisk, the latter Director of Research
                        of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. Both being scientists they were in a
                        position to give technical judgments concerning the subject matter at hand.
                        In July Dr. Bush was replaced by Mr. Carpenter, not a technical man, who has
                        recently been replaced by Mr. Webster, also without technical knowledge in
                        this field. Dr. Fisk recently resigned from the Atomic Energy Commission and
                        his place as Director of Research and as member of this Sub-Group has been
                        taken by a Dr. Johnson.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">Dr. Ralph P.

                    <p>In consequence not only the membership but the complexion of the American
                        side of the Technical Sub-Group has changed. On the side of Defense
                        Establishment representation, present membership does not possess the
                        requisite technical knowledge for an informed appraisal of areas proposed
                        for exchange. Both Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Webster, who would be the first to
                        admit lack of technical knowledge, have increasingly relied upon the advice
                        of the military members of the Military Liaison Committee in passing
                        judgment on the appropriateness of exchange of information in the nine
                        agreed areas. Because the nine areas have been defined in rather broad terms
                        there has been much room for administrative and operational interpretation.
                        In general, it is fair to say that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                        technical representative has inclined toward a more liberal definition,
                        whereas the Defense Establishment representative has tended toward a very
                        restrictive interpretation.</p>
                    <p>In part as a result of the episode concerning “the basic metallurgy of
                        plutonium”, the Military Liaison Committee has taken on the role of the
                        “watch dog” of technical exchange and has insisted on rather extensive
                        clearance and review functions with regard to the subject matter for
                        discussion between U.S., U.K., and Canadian members.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> considers that these review functions
                        are being exercised in a very restrictive and narrow manner. It is concerned
                        that exchange may be becoming so niggardly and reluctant that neither the
                        spirit nor intent of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> will be
                        carried out. Apart from the moral question of honoring a firm commitment to
                        the U.K. and Canada under the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of
                        January 7, the Commission is concerned that the increasingly narrow
                        interpretation given to the areas of exchange may have a serious adverse
                        effect on our raw materials situation.</p>
                    <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0293"/>
                    <p>The allocations made under the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> were for
                        1948 and 1949. Consideration must soon be given to allocations for 1950 and
                        1951. It seems quite evident that should the British come to feel that we
                        were not carrying out our obligations with respect to exchange of
                        information as provided in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, it
                        could not help having an adverse effect on their approach to the allocation
                        problem for the new period.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations with South Africa are in prospect for early 1949 to secure
                        uranium in eventual quantities that are likely to be quite large. A falling
                        out between the U.S. and the U.K. over the exchange of information aspect of
                        our undertakings could very well sour the prospects of successful
                        negotiations with the South Africans. It is expected that the United States
                        will take the lead in those negotiations with the active support and
                        assistance of the U.K. While the new Government of South Africa under Malan
                        is ostensibly rather anti-British, there are nevertheless certain
                        Commonwealth ties that are not easily unloosened. In fact, reports on the
                        Commonwealth conference indicate that South Africa is moving back into the
                        family a bit more closely.</p>
                    <p>It has been asserted in some military quarters that the United States should
                        flex its muscles and be prepared if necessary to go it alone on the question
                        of securing raw materials. These quarters argue that the U.K. is hopelessly
                        dependent upon the United States in so many matters that the United States
                        is in a position to dictate a junior role to the United Kingdom. By means of
                        the club of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> the U.K. could be told that
                        she must not proceed with the production of plutonium or atomic weapons and
                        that the United States will take unilateral action to assure adequate raw
                        material supply from South Africa and the Congo. From these
                        assumptions—which appear to me to be most dubious—it is then argued that
                        exchange of information under the January 7 <hi rend="italic">modus
                            vivendi</hi> should be cut to the merest trickle or stopped
                        altogether.</p>
                    <p>Setting aside the broader question of acceding to the request made to
                        Secretary Forrestal by Admiral Sir Henry Moore on September 1 for exchange
                        of information on the production of atomic weapons, on which everyone
                        including the U.K. is agreed no action should be taken at this time, the
                        immediate problem is the manner in which the United States should carry out
                        its present undertakings as regards exchange of information. When a team of
                        U.S. scientists reported back from a conference in London on Area 8, “The
                        Design of Natural Uranium Reactors in which the Power Generated is not
                        Wasted”, that U.K. activities in this field seem to confirm an emphasis on
                        plutonium production for eventual weapon use, Mr. Lilienthal asked for a
                        meeting of the American side <gloss target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> to discuss
                        whether this information <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0294"/>should
                        affect existing arrangements for interchange. The minutes of that meeting
                        which was held on July 6 record the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The consensus of the Committee was that cooperation should continue
                                as presently laid down. No initiative should be taken by the U.S. to
                                add to the nine agreed areas of technical cooperation. If, however,
                                the British made a formal approach to this effect the Committee
                                should seriously consider doing so, subject of course to discussions
                                with appropriate Congressional Committees.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>At that time you stated your view that the information brought to the
                        attention of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense by the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> should not in any way affect
                        existing arrangements. You also pointed out that the question of plutonium
                        production had not been raised at the December–January talks, but it was
                        your view that it was not assumed on our side that the British would not
                        produce weapons. You went on to say that the British had in fact confirmed
                        to the Department of State on March 19 last that they would produce weapons.
                        Mr. Carpenter stated that he had mentioned this problem briefly to Secretary
                        Forrestal and went on to say that in his own view the information contained
                        in the Commission’s letter should not in any way affect existing
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The record is, therefore, clear that exchange of information in nine agreed
                        areas was originally approved on January 7 and subsequently reaffirmed by
                        the American side members of <gloss target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> on July 6.
                        Nevertheless the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> considers that the
                        actual carrying out of this undertaking has become so seriously
                        circumscribed by methods and procedures demanded by the Defense
                        Establishment through the Military Liaison Committee that it is doubtful
                        whether the undertaking is in fact being honored. It is probable that Mr.
                        Lilienthal will wish to be in touch with you to discuss this matter and may
                        request a meeting of the American side members of <gloss target="#t_CPC1"
                            >CPC</gloss> to thrash out the whole problem.</p>
                    <p>In view of the high raw materials stakes involved—let alone the question of
                        honoring the spirit and letter of our undertakings—it is recommended that
                        the Department of State should throw its weight in favor of a more relaxed
                        method of cooperation within the nine agreed areas, without prejudice to the
                        larger issue of whether the areas should be extended to include the
                        information requested by Admiral Sir Henry Moore on September 1.</p>

                    <p>Sir Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador, came in to see me at his request
                        at 11:30 a. m., today to discuss several matters, among which was atomic
                        energy. He started out by saying that he had no instructions from his
                        Government to approach me and that he was doing so entirely on his own
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>He said that he had had conversations recently with Lilienthal,
                            Oppenheimer,<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer,
                            Chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic
                            Energy Commission; Director of the Institute for Advanced Study,
                            Princeton, New Jersey; Director of Los Alamos Laboratories, Manhattan
                            Engineer District, 1943–1945.</note> and Sir John Cockcroft. These
                        conversations had led him to the conclusion that the exchange of information
                        and cooperation between our two Governments is not as good as it should be,
                        and indeed not as good as it might be if the present understandings were
                        interpreted somewhat more liberally. He therefore raised the question of
                        whether it might not be desirable for the two Governments to exchange views
                        on opening this whole question and seeing whether it would not be possible
                        and desirable to expand their cooperation in this field.</p>
                    <p>Sir Oliver pointed out as an example of one of the questions which might
                        usefully be discussed in such an exchange that they are going ahead in the
                        UK with certain things; with US cooperation and assistance the British can
                        go into production in a short time; but even without US assistance and
                        cooperation in a somewhat longer time the British still expect their efforts
                        to succeed and to be able to go into production. He said that this last fact
                        had not, in his opinion, been fully understood in the US. He said that there
                        had been a number of important developments since our conversations last
                        winter which, in his opinion, might well justify a fresh examination of this
                        whole question and he inquired what I thought about this.</p>
                    <p>I told Sir Oliver that there had been a number of important developments.
                        Among these were the complete rejection of international control of atomic
                        energy by the Russians, and, as a consequence, it appeared that no
                        international agreement was likely for an indefinite period of time. Another
                        important development was the election in <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786"
                            facs="0296"/>the US. In consequence of the election we will have a
                        change in the heads of the committees in Congress which have been dealing
                        with this matter.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say that we have the continued dispute in this country between
                        the military and the Atomic Energy Commission over custody. There are,
                        moreover, certain problems and uncertainties with regard to the Atomic
                        Energy Commission itself.</p>
                    <p>I told Sir Oliver that, in my opinion, it would be a mistake for the US and
                        UK Governments to have a general exchange of views on atomic energy at the
                        present time. I suggested that we put this question aside at least for
                        another couple of months or so until the Congressional Committees have been
                        organized and get going and some of these other matters have been
                        clarified.</p>
                    <p>Sir Oliver at once agreed with me that this would be desirable and said that
                        as he had pointed out in the beginning he had raised this question entirely
                        on his own initiative.</p>

                        Mr. Donald Maclean of the British Embassy informed Mr. Arneson of a request
                        which had been made to the British Government by the Norwegian Atomic Energy
                        Institute for the treatment of uranium oxide. Subsequently Mr. Arneson spoke
                        to Mr. Henderson of the British Embassy informally about this subject and
                        said that the State Department, without having reached a final decision,
                        were not disposed to welcome the idea that the British Government should
                        meet the Norwegian request for the purification of the oxide. He said that
                        if the British Government were to meet the Norwegian request, it would
                        enable the latter to find out the exact degree of purity of oxide required
                        for use in the pile. This had certain dangers from the point of view of
                        security. There was also the risk that the Russians might occupy Norway and
                        get hold of the purified oxide.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">In a memorandum
                            to Lovett, November 22, Arneson stated that the present <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> had omitted the most important
                            argument which had been presented to the British: that the Norwegian
                            case should not be considered alone, but in accordance with an over-all
                            review of atomic energy policy (Department of State Atomic Energy
                            Files).</note> It was explained that the Norwegians had expressed <pb
                            n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0297"/>their intention to build a refining
                        plant of their own should the British Government not be able to refine the
                        oxide for them. In that event, and if the Russians were to invade Norway,
                        they would obtain not only pure oxide but also the plant itself. Mr. Arneson
                        countered by saying that the Norwegians would not be able to build a plant
                        at any rate for two years. He emphasized, however, that the United States
                        Atomic Energy Commission had not yet commented on this subject and that his
                        views could in no way be considered as the final response of the United
                        States Government.</p>
                    <p>2. The British Government have reviewed the matter again in the light of Mr.
                        Arneson’s views. While grateful to learn these preliminary views, they
                        conclude that there is little danger involved in meeting the Norwegian
                        request and that continued delay in doing so can only bring unfortunate
                        results. The matter has been hanging fire for a considerable time and the
                        British Government believe that it would be unfortunate to maintain a
                        negative attitude on what is a relatively straightforward matter since it is
                        desirable that the Norwegians and other European governments should look to
                        Britain rather than to France for help and guidance in atomic energy
                        developments. The British Government would therefore be grateful if the
                        State Department could give this subject urgent attention so as to enable
                        them to give a favourable reply to the Norwegians.</p>

                        on the Norwegian matter as an isolated case. This Government feels that a
                        general review must be made of its over-all atomic energy policy before it
                        is in a position to express its view on the Norwegian request. Steps are
                        being taken to make such a review within this Government, and pending its
                        completion, the United States considers that a definite answer to the

                    <p>In accordance with the request contained in the memorandum from your office
                        dated 29 October 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1">Not found in Department
                            of State files.</note> the Joint Chiefs of Staff have studied the matter
                        of the advisability of the United States Government concurring in British
                        assistance to the Norwegian Government in processing uranium oxide for use
                        in an experimental heavy water pile.</p>
                    <p>The processing of the uranium ore by the British would obviate the necessity
                        for construction of the necessary plans in Norway. If Britain refuses,
                        Norway may try to get this service from the French, who, if willing,
                        probably could process the ore, although on a considerably less satisfactory
                        and timely basis than could the British. The process is not highly secret,
                        but plant construction is time-consuming and relatively costly by European
                        standards. The effect then of processing the ore by the British or French
                        would be to save the Norwegians one step in the production of fissionable
                        material. An undertaking by Norway to produce fissionable material from
                        refined products would involve development there of a potential for atomic
                        or radiological warfare.</p>
                    <p>Establishment in Norway of facilities for the production of fissionable
                        material is undesirable from the military point of view for the following
                        reasons: <list>

                            <item>If undertaken with United States and/or British consent or
                                assistance it would establish an extremely dangerous precedent in
                                that other nations would be sure to make similar requests which
                                would then be difficult to deny. Moreover, as Norway acquires
                                experience and facilities in the atomic energy field, requests for
                                additional information and assistance could be expected;</item>

                            <item>It increases the possibility that secret information obtained from
                                the operation of the plant may fall into wrong hands, thus
                                shortening the period of grace during which the United States will
                                be the only nation possessing the atomic bomb;</item>

                            <item>It involves large and unnecessary expenditures by a nation now in
                                such straitened circumstances that economic aid is being provided by

                            <item>It would create an additional demand for raw materials already in
                                extremely short supply and for which the United States is competing
                                in the world market.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>The denial of the Norwegian request would avoid the establishment of a
                        precedent and would also have the effect of delaying the production <pb
                            n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0299"/>of fissionable material in Norway
                        for a considerable period of time. These considerations alone are believed
                        to be overriding, even though it is possible that some degree of
                        collaboration may, in consequence, result between France and Norway unless
                        this can be forestalled on the diplomatic level.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff therefore feel that every effort should be made to
                        prevent or at least discourage the establishment of facilities for the
                        production of fissionable materials, pending the adoption of international
                        control of atomic energy by the United Nations They also feel that no
                        favorable consideration should be given to any such request as Norway’s
                        pending adoption of a general over-all United States policy on such matters,
                        this policy to include provision for certain selected atomic energy
                        information or assistance to be granted only in return for direct and major
                        security benefits not obtainable otherwise.</p>

                    <p>The British Government have considered the letter addressed by Mr. Lovett to
                        the British Ambassador on the 22nd of November<note n="1" xml:id="d114fn1">

                        on the above subject. They are disappointed that the United States
                        Government have not yet been able to reach a firm conclusion on the
                        Norwegian request. After reconsidering the matter, they do not think that
                        they can reasonably or justifiably further delay a reply to the Norwegians,
                        whose request was made three months ago, until the United States Government
                        have carried out their review of general policy which may apparently take as
                        long as four months.</p>
                    <p>For the reasons which have already been given to the United States
                        Government, the British Government consider that they should accept the
                        Norwegian request and feel obliged to indicate to the Norwegians now that
                        they hope to be able to assist them. The British Government <pb n="790"
                            xml:id="pg_790" facs="0300"/>will, however, explain to the Norwegians
                        that they cannot at this stage say precisely when it may be possible to
                        begin to take on their work since it must obviously be fitted in to the
                        British programme at Springfield. There is no question of starting on the
                        Norwegian contract for some time. In their earlier dealings, the Norwegians
                        showed that they recognised that the work would have to be done at the
                        convenience of the British Government.</p>
                    <p>The British Government feel that they cannot continue to hold up a reply to
                        the Norwegians and that they ought now to make them the relatively
                        encouraging response indicated above. They propose to approach the
                        Norwegians this week.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: On November 30 Mr.
                        Henderson informed Mr. Arneson verbally that London
                        considers—notwithstanding the view I expressed to you by note of November
                        22, 1948—it is obliged to inform the Norwegians in the next few days of its
                        willingness to undertake the purification of from ten to twenty tons of
                        uranium oxide in the Springfields plant. He explained that London proposes
                        to tell the Norwegians, however, that it can make no commitment as to when
                        the schedule at Springfields will permit actual commencement of the work. At
                        Mr. Arneson’s request Mr. Henderson has confirmed this information by note
                        of December 2.<note n="1" xml:id="d115fn1">

                    </p>
                    <p>It is the considered view of the American members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CPC1">CPC</gloss> that the action proposed by London should
                        not be taken. It is felt that such action is not within the spirit of the
                            <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of January 7 which provides among
                        other things that “in the interest of mutual security, classified
                        information in the field of atomic energy will not be disclosed to other
                        governments or authorities or persons in other countries without due prior
                        consultation.” While the formalities of the foregoing have been fulfilled by
                        the notification given, it is considered that the U.K. Government should not
                        proceed without the concurrence of the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>We cannot give that concurrence now. While it is regretted that considerable
                        delay has been involved in this matter and while it is hoped that a general
                        review of policy in this field may be expedited, this Government reaffirms
                        its opinion that favorable action on the <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791"

                    <p>In a conversation with M. Taymans who called yesterday afternoon at his
                        request, Mr. Achilles stated that the Department had received a telegram
                        from the Embassy in Brussels setting forth views expressed by M. Spaak
                        concerning the inclusion of the Belgian Congo in the area to be covered by
                        the North Atlantic Pact.<note n="1" xml:id="d116fn1">Telegram 2087, November
                            29; for text, see <ref target="frus1948v03#pg_298">vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>, p. 298</ref>.</note> Mr. Achilles
                        understood that M. Spaak had referred to the 30th Parallel North Latitude as
                        being the southern limit under consideration in the military conversations
                        in London and had expressed his concern that this limit included North
                        Africa without providing for inclusion of the Belgian Congo, whose strategic
                        position is of vital importance to all parties concerned, particularly to
                        the United States, as well as to Belgium. He had further stated that he
                        anticipated difficulties in explaining to the Belgian Parliament why the
                        North Atlantic Pact included part of Africa but made no mention of the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Achilles stated that the United States did not consider that the North
                        Atlantic Pact could possibly cover the Congo. Although United States
                        thinking favored the Tropic of Cancer in preference to the 30th Parallel as
                        the southern limit of the land, sea, and air space of the North Atlantic, it
                        did not favor the inclusion of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> African territory
                        in the area defined by the Pact. If this latter view prevailed, the
                        difficulties foreseen by Spaak would be lessened.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Achilles went on to say that the defense of the Congo was foremost in the
                        minds of United States officials and that the National Military
                        Establishment had been approached informally on this subject by the
                        Department of State. The National Military Establishment attached the
                        highest importance to the Congo’s remaining inviolate, as did the Government
                        as a whole, but we did not see that any specific reassurance could be given
                        at this time. The great interest of the <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792"
                            facs="0302"/>United States in the integrity of the Belgian Congo was
                        self-evident and was far more fundamental than any specific assurances.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">Achilles added the following in a letter to
                            Taymans dated December 10: “We have discussed this question further with
                            representatives of the National Military Establishment who have
                            indicated that, if the Belgian Government should desire to convey to the
                            National Military Establishment any specific views concerning the
                            security of the Congo, they would be glad to exchange views with any
                            representative M. Spaak might wish to send. This would not, of course,
                            imply willingness on the part of the United States to undertake any
                            specific commitments. <p>We have advised Ambassador Kirk of the
                                foregoing with the request that he bring it to the attention of M.

                        in which you expressed the opposition of the United States Government to the
                        proposal made by the British Government that they should inform the
                        Norwegian Government of their willingness to assist in purifying a small
                        quantity of uranium oxide.</p>
                    <p>I have now heard that the British Government have not yet said anything to
                        the Norwegians. They consider, however, that the United States Government
                        may have read more into their proposal than was intended. The British
                        Government were not proposing to make any firm commitment to the Norwegians
                        but merely to encourage them with the hope that they would be able to assist
                        them. They hoped thereby to avert an immediate approach by the Norwegians to
                        the French, for they believed that the French had facilities to refine oxide
                        for the Norwegians in France and that the Norwegians would be likely to
                        apply to them if no prospect of help from the United Kingdom was
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The authorities concerned in London have again emphasized that there is no
                        question of starting to refine oxide for the Norwegians for some time.
                        Indeed they have informed me that the work might not be put into effect for
                        two years. In these circumstances they cannot see what security risk is
                        involved.</p>
                    <pb n="793" xml:id="pg_793" facs="0303"/>
                    <p>If I might sum up the position: The British Government have not so far sent
                        any reply to the Norwegian approach which was made last August; they are
                        reluctant to continue to leave the situation open for if they do so, they
                        consider that the Norwegians may well turn for help to the French; they
                        would like, therefore, to give some response to the Norwegians of a
                        reasonably forthcoming kind but which would be quite non-committal. This
                        would help to hold the situation and could not be of any danger to security.
                        I would add that such an interim reply would not prevent the British
                        Government from refusing the Norwegian request later if the United States
                        Government decided, after reviewing the whole question of atomic energy
                        development in Western Europe, that they could not give their consent.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps you would kindly let me know whether the course of action outlined
                        above is agreeable to you.<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">In a memorandum to
                            Lovett, December 23, Arneson stated the following: “I am at a loss to
                            know what form of words can accomplish what Sir Oliver refers to as a
                            response which is both ‘reasonably forthcoming’ and also ‘quite
                            noncommittal,’ but perhaps the subtleties of British diplomacy can cook
                            that one up.” (Department of State Atomic Energy Files) <p>Also on
                                December 23, the Under Secretary of State replied to the British
                                Ambassador in a note which stated the following: “Your note of
                                December 21 expressed London’s concern that a negative reply to the
                                Norwegians might drive them immediately into the arms of the French.
                                I agree that cooperation between the French and Norwegians in this
                                matter should be forestalled. I agree also that any reply to the
                                Norwegians that can accomplish this without committing the United
                                Kingdom Government actually to take on the work is desirable.”

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Paul</hi>: I am writing this letter as a result of
                        recent conversations between members of the Strategic Materials Division of
                        the Economic Cooperation Administration, the Atomic Energy Commission, and
                        the Department regarding <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>’s role in
                        procurement of atomic energy raw materials. These staff conversations have
                        indicated the desirability of an interchange of official communications
                        between our two agencies to supplement the informal views presented at a
                        meeting in Mr. C. Tyler Wood’s<note n="1" xml:id="d118fn1">Assistant to the
                            Deputy Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration.</note>
                        office on August 3, 1948.</p>
                    <p>It would be helpful first to review briefly related discussions held <pb
                            n="794" xml:id="pg_794" facs="0304"/>with certain members of the
                        Congress which are pertinent to the matter.</p>
                    <p>From the initial stages of the formulation of the European aid program there
                        was considerable interest on the part of some Congressional leaders
                        regarding the possible inclusion of uranium as one of the materials which
                        this Government would seek from the recipients of U.S. economic assistance.
                        Representatives of the Department called on these leaders in November
                            1947<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">This matter was discussed by Under
                            Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, and Senators
                            Hickenlooper and Vandenberg on November 16, 1947; for the record of that
                            meeting, see <ref target="frus1947v01#pg_864">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1947, vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 864</ref>.</note> at their request
                        to discuss the problem in some detail. It was pointed out to the Congressmen
                        that it would be prejudicial to our objectives to link the United States aid
                        program with our desires to secure supplies of atomic raw materials and that
                        such action might result in charges that the United States Government
                        intended to bargain relief from want against continuation of the United
                        States atomic monopoly, thus giving powerful corroboration to Communistic
                        propaganda in opposition to the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>. It was
                        explained that supplies of uranium required for our atomic energy program
                        were provided for through long-standing arrangements with certain foreign
                        governments and that it would be undesirable to jeopardize the continuation
                        of these arrangements by risking attacks on the governments concerned
                        through injection of the uranium issue into the aid program. In this
                        connection, Belgium was cited as an example where an effort to gain
                        advantages beyond those already arrived at through mutual good faith might
                        provoke a political crisis and thus threaten the security of our
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The Department had occasion to expand on the above views to other members of
                        the Congress some time later when provisions designed primarily for the
                        control of the export of atomic energy materials and equipment by European
                        countries were being considered for inclusion in the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                            >ECA</gloss> Bill. In addition to citing other reasons, the Department
                        termed such provisions undesirable since the countries most likely in
                        position to supply the materials, other than raw materials, desired by
                        Eastern Europe, would be Sweden and Switzerland, neither of which would
                        derive much assistance under <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>. Moreover,
                        with respect to atomic energy raw materials controlled by European nations,
                        it was stated that the United States has satisfactory understandings with
                        all those countries likely to be of substantial importance in this
                        connection and that these should not be jeopardized by use of our <gloss
                            target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> leverage.</p>
                    <p>Immediately following enactment of the Economic Cooperation Act, the
                        Department in collaboration with the Atomic Energy Commission, took steps to
                        secure establishment of controls over exports of <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795"
                            facs="0305"/>atomic energy materials to the Soviet sphere by Western
                        European countries similar to those practiced by the United States
                        Government. The premises of the Department’s position that our objectives
                        should be sought through diplomatic representations rather than through
                        operation of the European aid program are outlined in my letter to you of
                        June 28, 1948.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">

                        Although this letter is directed primarily to the problem of control over
                        the export of atomic energy materials, including ores, to Eastern Europe,
                        the philosophy included therein is also applicable to the problem of
                        acquiring raw materials for our domestic program: the security objectives of
                        Western European countries and ourselves are of mutual concern and any
                        problems arising in this connection can be resolved through diplomatic
                        channels without resort to other criteria such as those involved in the
                        foreign aid program.</p>
                    <p>There are several additional points I would like to mention for your
                        information to supplement the above commentary. First, the arrangements
                        under which the Atomic Energy Commission secures raw materials from other
                        countries are concluded on the basis of thorough consultation between the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, the National Defense Establishment,
                        and the Department of State. In addition, these three agencies represent the
                        United States on the Combined Policy Committee, under which U.S., Canadian
                        and British cooperation in certain specific areas of atomic energy,
                        including the acquisition of raw materials, is handled. Through procedures
                        of long-standing, this Committee meets in Washington and it has been a
                        natural development that consultations on atomic energy matters involving
                        other foreign governments are likewise held here.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of practice communications between Washington and U.S.
                        representatives abroad dealing with matters in this field are handled
                        through the facilities of the Department and the American diplomatic
                        missions abroad. <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> representatives have
                        agreed in principle that transmittal of such information or samples
                        regarding atomic energy raw materials, including uranium, thorium and
                        beryllium, which become available to your missions abroad should be handled
                        in the above manner and that coordination of the views of <gloss
                            target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and other interested agencies should be
                        made in Washington. I am gratified to note how expeditiously this
                        arrangement functioned both here and in Rome in the handling of two uranium
                        problems which recently came to the attention of the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                            >ECA</gloss> mission in Italy.<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">Reference is

                    <p>I understand that consideration is being given to sending instructions to
                            <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> missions abroad regarding their

                    <p>The Netherlands Ambassador, in presenting the attached note which is in reply
                        to our note of April 13,<note n="1" xml:id="d119fn1">
                            <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_704">p. 704</ref>.</note>
                        explained that the reply of his Government had been delayed owing to the
                        fact that only a very few officials know of the 1945 agreement. He explained
                        that its existence is known only to himself, the Prime Minister, the
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Permanent Under Secretary of Foreign
                        Affairs, the Minister for Overseas Territories, and the Permanent Under
                        Secretary for Overseas Territories.</p>
                    <p>The Netherlands note confirms the extension of the agreement until August 4,
                        1951 by virtue of the option exercised by the U.S. and U.K. on April 13. As
                        to the proposal of the U.S. to send a survey party to <gloss
                            target="#t_NEI1">NEI</gloss>, the Netherlands Government expresses its
                        willingness to have such a survey conducted but feels that in view of the
                        information transmitted with the note concerning the occurrences of monazite
                        in the three islands in question, namely Billiton, Banka, and Singkep, there
                        would appear to be little basis for such a survey. However, the Netherlands
                        Ambassador emphasized the fact that should the United States Government
                        still desire to carry out the survey the Netherlands Government would not
                        only be willing that it be done, but would assist in every feasible way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hickerson and I thanked the Netherlands Ambassador for his note and told
                        him a reply would be forthcoming in due course after the matter had been
                        discussed with the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>The Netherlands Ambassador also referred to the approach made by our
                        Ambassador at The Hague on September 2, 1948, on the matter <pb n="797"
                            xml:id="pg_797" facs="0307"/>of instituting parallel atomic energy

                        know whether there was any connection between these two questions. He was
                        assured that there was not and that indeed the approach on export controls
                        was being made to a number of governments in the interests of mutual
                        security. The Ambassador said he was glad to be reassured on this point and
                        was confident that an eminently satisfactory reply would be forthcoming from
                        his Government in due course.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of the Netherlands presents his compliments to the
                            Honorable the Acting Secretary of State, and has the honor to refer to
                            Mr. Lovett’s Top Secret memorandum dated April 13, 1948, in which notice
                            was given that the Government of the United States of America, together
                            with the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
                            Ireland, desired to exercise their option to extend, for an additional
                            period of three years, the secret agreement between the Netherlands
                            Government and the Governments of the United States of America and of
                            the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed in
                            London on August 4, 1945.</p>
                        <p>2. In reply, Mr. van Kleffens has the honor to state that, as a result of
                            the exercise of the said option, the Netherlands Government considers
                            the agreement as extended for an additional period of three years, i.e.
                            until August 4, 1951.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. van Kleffens has been instructed to add that, the price of
                            monazite sand being, according to information received by the
                            Netherlands Government, in excess of the price agreed upon in the
                            aforesaid agreement for the initial period of three years, his
                            Government will avail itself of the final sentence of clause 5 of the
                            agreement, should any purchases be made under that clause during the
                            period indicated in para. 2 (above).</p>
                        <p>4. The memorandum of April 13, 1948, also contained a proposal, presented
                            for the consideration of the Government of the Netherlands, for a field
                            investigation of the monazite reserves of the islands of Billiton, Banka
                            and Singkep by three qualified mineral engineers of the United States
                            Government. This proposal, the memorandum stated, was made with the full
                            knowledge and concurrence of the Government of the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0308"/>
                        <p>5. In reply, Mr. van Kleffens has been authorised to state that the
                            Government of the Netherlands will gladly enable three qualified mining
                            engineers of the United States Government to carry out the suggested
                            field investigation. Before deciding whether it is worth while to have
                            that investigation made, the United States Government may, however, wish
                            to consider the following facts as borne out by data now in the hands of
                            the mining companies: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>On the island of Banka, no monazite is found with a thorium
                                    content of any significance.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Nor does present mining of tin ore on the island of Billiton
                                    yield monazite as a by-product. In former days, monazite was
                                    found in the south-western part of the island (Dendang
                                    district), which was dumped on the spot and left in the
                                    tailings. For the last thirty years, however, this part of the
                                    island has been unimportant for mining tin. There are no data
                                    extant from that former period with regard to monazite content
                                    in the said district, no attention having been paid to it in
                                    view of the very limited possibilities to dispose of monazite.
                                    If desired, the Billiton-Company could carry out an
                                    investigation in the district.</item>

                            Government seriously doubt whether the dispatch of engineers for a field
                            investigation on these islands would prove to be warranted. Should,
                            however, the United States Government wish to proceed with the idea, the
                            Netherlands Government, desirous to be helpful, will gladly lend its
                            cooperation on the basis suggested in Mr. Lovett’s memorandum of April
                            13, 1948.</p>

                    <p>It has always been the practice for the Secretary of State to submit to the
                        President for approval the names of those persons proposed to represent this
                        Government both permanently on international organizations and temporarily
                        at international conferences. In some instances, like the United Nations,
                        the enabling legislation for participation requires Presidential approval as
                        well as Senate confirmation of United States Representatives, Alternates or
                        Delegates. Otherwise, the practice of reference to the President has been a
                        matter of custom, not of law.</p>
                    <p>Approval of the hundreds of such designations may be for you an unnecessary
                        burden which could be partially eased now in view of the broad consideration
                        among interested government agencies and private interested groups that
                        normally precede my nominations to you. Furthermore, I believe that your
                        attention may not be warranted for many technical or exploratory
                        delegations, for many brief assignments or for the selection of advisory and
                        secretariat staffs. Some few lists of advisory personnel on delegations to
                        recent meetings have not been sent you because of their non-committal
                        character. Since all such designations are peculiarly a Presidential
                        prerogative, however, I would welcome a delegation of authority from the
                        President to the Secretary of State for certain instances.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I recommend that you continue to approve the designation of those
                        United States Representatives, Alternates and Delegates to international
                        organizations and conferences as required by law or of major importance, and
                        that you delegate to the Secretary of State the authority to designate all
                        other representatives and delegates as well as advisory and secretariat
                        staffs for all groups. You would thus authorize me to state in any letter of
                        designation: “By authority of the President the Secretary of State
                        designates you …”. A list of typical international activities in both
                        categories is enclosed. If at any <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0310"
                        />time a difference of opinion arose within the Government on any of the
                        matters so delegated to me, I would of course exercise the discretion of
                        referring the question to you for decision.</p>
                    <p>I should appreciate your informing me whether you approve the above
                        delegation of authority with regard to the designation of United States
                        delegations and representatives to international conferences and

                        critical importance. Quantitative restrictions are worst type of barrier to
                        trade and their use can completely nullify tariff concessions granted to us
                        in return for reductions our tariff. It is essential that there be

                        4419, December 6).</p>
                    <p>Chauvel felt this incident required special attention by Foreign Affairs and
                        asked me to give him memorandum on incident and our position thereon. He
                        would then press matter with competent ministers in effort to prevent
                        recurrence. Accordingly, I have transmitted memo to Chauvel on basis <gloss

                        Article 24 against opposition Philip and other officials in other
                        ministries. Guindey said his government had received cable request from
                        Philip Habana for instructions whether French should propose any amendment
                        to Article 24 in view of deadline which Guindey understood to be December 6.
                        Guindey said Philip instructed by cable December 6 to propose no amendments.
                        Philip had also asked whether he should support Belgian proposed amendment
                        which would alter voting powers of fund members (Guindey did not know
                        details Belgian proposal but Reagan gathered inference was to weaken US
                        voting strength). Philip was instructed not to support Belgian proposal.</p>
                    <p>Asked for explanation of French “attack” Guindey surmised French “expose”
                        December 3 was not really attack but probably reiteration of French position
                        (particularly Philip’s) on this article during discussions Geneva. It was
                        pointed out to Guindey that, since French Government had formally accepted
                        Article 24 and parallel position in general agreement, it seemed gratuitous
                        and unnecessary for French delegates Habana to reiterate position taken
                        during discussions Geneva, especially as such repetition might have adverse
                        influence on attitude of other delegations at Habana. Guindey admitted
                        validity this argument and said he would have matter investigated and effort
                        made to bring French delegation under control.</p>

                    <p>The four major issues which have arisen in connection with the employment and
                        economic activity chapter may be summarized as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The desire on the part of several countries to broaden Article 4
                                to include detailed provisions regarding conditions of labor and
                                treatment of migratory labor, the latter being of particular concern
                                to Mexico. The United States is in sympathy with the desire for
                                social legislation and improvement of labor conditions but believes
                                that such provisions are not properly within the scope of the <gloss

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Various proposals have been introduced which would have the effect
                                of releasing a member country from its responsibilities under the
                                commercial policy chapter if the country felt that it was being
                                damaged by employment policies adopted by another Member—by
                                competition from products produced under substandard conditions of
                                labor and pay. The most extreme position is represented by Uruguay
                                and a modified amendment has been put forward by Mexico.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Italy is particularly concerned with restrictions (by means of
                                immigration laws) on migration of peoples from over-populated
                                countries and has introduced a resolution to the effect that Members
                                “recognize that the existence at the same time of the problems of
                                unemployment and lack of manpower requires the gradual repeal of
                                every restriction to international migration not justified by vital
                                requirements of the country concerned …” While it is recognized that
                                for Italy the question of excess population is a very pressing one,
                                the United States does not believe that the solution to the problem
                                lies within the scope of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                                Charter.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Norway has introduced the question of permitting a member country
                                to take price stabilization measures as a means of insulating itself
                                against inflationary movements in another country, on the ground
                                that problems of inflation are just as important as problems of
                                deflation and that they should be equally covered in Chapter II.
                                Norway has also proposed a phrase in Article 3 (obligating a Member
                                to take action to achieve and maintain employment) which would also
                                obligate each Member “to prevent wide fluctuations in the general
                                level of demand or prices.” The implications of the Norwegian
                                proposals are not yet entirely clear. They do, however, open up a
                                whole new question, namely, inflation control. They would appear to
                                be introducing not only a substantially new obligation but also a
                                new escape clause for measures to be taken by countries operating
                                under a controlled economy.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>Basic issues involved in the many amendments which have been submitted for
                        this chapter center around proposals for the Organization to take positive
                        measures to assist Members in their economic development. Of these perhaps
                        the most important is an amendment proposed by Mexico for the establishment
                        of an economic development commission. The proposal was actually made as an
                        amendment to Article 70 in the chapter on organization but the purpose of
                        creating the committee relates to the economic development chapter. The
                        Mexican proposal involves the following ideas: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The committee should be permanent, on a level equal to the Tariff

                            <item>It should help any Member desiring assistance in obtaining it,
                                either from the International Bank, from other Members of <gloss

                    <p>Mexico was supported by Venezuela, Cuba, Costa Rica, Egypt, China, Pakistan
                        and El Salvador. Greece, Turkey, France and Italy stressed the need for
                        reconstruction as well as development.</p>
                    <p>Other countries stressed the difficulties involved with the Mexican proposal

                            <item>The danger that such a body as a governmental committee within
                                    <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> would interfere with the

                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The fear that such a body might lose sight of the primary duty of
                                the under-developed nations themselves to take the major
                                responsibility for their own development.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Delegations taking this view included Australia, U.K., Sweden, Belgium,
                        Canada, Luxemburg and South Africa.</p>
                    <p>Since this question concerned both Committee II and Committee VI on
                        organization, it was decided to have a joint subcommittee to consider this
                        and related amendments. It was suggested that the committee <pb n="811"
                            xml:id="pg_811" facs="0321"/>be instructed among other things to examine
                        the activities of other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies or
                        organizations in the economic development field.</p>
                    <p>Upon the suggestion that the proposal for a committee on economic development
                        should be referred to the subcommittee, the Australian delegate made an
                        effective statement along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>His country was under-developed and he considered Chapter III to be
                                of vital importance to the Charter. Were the Organization not to
                                fulfill its proper functions in the field of economic development,
                                the rest of the Charter would fall. However, his delegation
                                considered that it would not be desirable to give the Organization
                                its “working instructions” in the Charter and thus to phrase an
                                internal organization system which might, in the long run, prove to
                                be unworkable. While in agreement, therefore, with the proposal to
                                refer the Mexican amendment on a committee for economic development
                                to a sub-committee, he wished to make clear that the Australian
                                position was in favor of leaving the internal organization of the

                        <hi rend="italic">Investment:</hi> A number of suggestions have been made
                        regarding Article 12. However, if the United States proposal to eliminate
                        paragraph 2 of Article 12 is accepted, the amendments relating to this
                        paragraph will automatically be dropped. Chile has introduced a new
                        paragraph directed at increasing the flow of private investments to
                        under-developed countries which would require Members to “prevent all
                        speculation in consumer goods of vital importance to other member
                        countries”; to facilitate the establishment of industries in other member
                        countries; and to provide that Members “with a favorable balance of payments
                        and plentiful supplies of capital shall take the necessary steps to
                        facilitate the obtaining of adequate long and short-term credits … by
                        countries which request them …” This and one or two proposals of a related
                        character are considered by the United States out of line with the Charter
                        and not feasible.</p>
                    <p>With respect to preferential arrangements for economic development, a number
                        of amendments have been introduced which would have the effect of loosening
                        up the present provisions of the Charter which currently require prior
                        approval by the Organization before new preferential arrangements can be
                        entered into. The general line of the proposals is to permit new regional
                        preferential arrangements to be entered into on notification to the
                        Organization but without prior approval.</p>

                        support from any delegation. The effect of such an amendment would be to

                            <item>The U.S. is wholeheartedly in accord with the principle of
                                eliminating preferences because they tend to restrict trade and give
                                rise to conflicts between countries.</item>

                            <item>Long consideration and discussion in meetings of the Preparatory
                                Committee had led U.S. to conviction that elimination of all
                                existing preferences overnight would create insuperable political
                                and economic disturbances. The Draft Charter prevents increase in
                                existing preferences and provides for their elimination through
                                negotiation.</item>

                            <item>With regard to new preferences, U.S. is of the opinion that in
                                general they do not form a suitable device for economic development
                                but we recognize that there are special cases where new preferences
                                may be justified. Hence we favor approach of Draft Charter requiring
                                a case-by-case scrutiny by the Organization to see whether the
                                proposed preferences would be likely to prove a net gain to the

                        <hi rend="italic">Committee IV—Restrictive Business Practices</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The principal points at issue which are currently under consideration in
                        sub-committees are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. General obligation of members towards restrictive business practices.</p>
                    <p>The Geneva Draft obligates a member to take appropriate steps to prevent
                        business practices “which restrain competition … whenever such practices
                        have harmful effects on the expansion of production or trade and interfere
                        with the achievement of any of the other objectives set forth in Article 1”.
                        A proposed amendment by Norway would insert a further condition which would
                        in effect require a determination that the commercial enterprises in
                        question “possess effective control of trade between two or more countries
                        in one or more products”. This change was resisted by the U.S. as a serious
                        watering-down of the obligations and of the purposes of the Chapter.</p>
                    <p>2. Exemption of Public Enterprises.</p>
                    <p>Argentina has proposed an amendment to delete all mention of public
                        commercial enterprises from the Chapter on the ground that such an agency as
                        the Argentine Institute for the Promotion of Interchange, being state-owned,
                        might be affected although its function is to aid in the development of
                        Argentina’s national economy, and not to restrict trade, and to include
                        public enterprises would constitute an infringement of sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>The Argentine amendment involves the whole issue of state-trading operations
                        and is the fundamental issue being raised in the chapter. The U.S. takes the
                        position that public commercial enterprises must be subject to the same
                        rules as private enterprise. In support of the Argentine position, Peru
                        declared that the chapter condemns the applications of new business ideas
                        such as are now in force in Sweden, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the
                        USSR, as well as other eastern European countries. Many nations, including
                        those in Latin America, were developing their economies by means of public
                        enterprises, <pb n="814" xml:id="pg_814" facs="0324"/>under which they
                        sought their own markets and controlled their own consumption in order to
                        aid their development.</p>
                    <p>3. Exemption of Services.</p>
                    <p>Argentina has proposed that the whole of Article 50 which sets forth the
                        procedure for dealing with restrictive business practices relating to
                        certain international services, “such as transportation, telecommunications,
                        insurance and banking”, shall be deleted from the Chapter.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Following are the main problems which have arisen in connection with the
                        Commodity Agreements Chapter:</p>
                    <p>1. The respective roles of the <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>India has introduced an amendment to increase the role of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> in the making of inter-governmental
                        commodity agreements by specifically establishing the right of <gloss
                            target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> to call commodity conferences. There has
                        been no substantial support for the Indian proposal. It was pointed out by
                        the delegate from the U.S. that his government had always favored the
                        inclusion of an <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> representative in a
                        commodity commission and that no opposition had been expressed during the
                        Preparatory Committee discussions. However, there had to be some central
                        authority over the structure of the control agencies and it was logical that
                        that authority should rest in the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian representative pointed out that the question of commodity
                        agreements was closely linked to other provisions of the Charter,
                        particularly to those regarding the subsidization of exports, and strongly
                        supported the position that the authority to initiate commodity control
                        agreements could not be allowed to rest outside the <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss>. France, Cuba and the United Kingdom also supported the
                        Geneva Draft on this point.</p>
                    <p>2. Conditions Governing the Use of Commodity Control Agreements (Article
                        59).</p>
                    <p>An amendment was introduced by Venezuela to add to the conditions, under
                        which a commodity control agreement would be permissible, a clause that
                        would permit any control agreement the purpose of which was to fulfill the
                        objectives of Article 54(c), namely, the stabilization of prices in primary
                        commodities. The two conditions in the Geneva Draft are, in brief, that
                        burdensome surplus must exist or be threatened, or that unemployment in
                        connection with a primary commodity has developed or is expected to develop.
                        It was argued by Venezuela that disequilibrium in supply and demand and
                        fluctuations of prices were not always caused by the conditions mentioned in
                        Article 59, and that therefore these cases would not be covered under the
                        present wording. Pakistan and Colombia supported this position.</p>
                    <pb n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0325"/>
                    <p>It was the view of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the
                        Netherlands, and Australia that to insert the suggested provision would
                        vitiate the purpose of the article by eliminating the burdensome surplus
                        requirement and that when the Chapter was considered as a whole the problems
                        of price fluctuations had been adequately covered. It was pointed out by the
                        delegate from France that the Commodity Chapter provided an exception to the
                        provisions of previous chapters, particularly the one on Commercial Policy;
                        it permitted Members in exceptional circumstances to use measures otherwise
                        debarred. There was a distinction between inter-governmental commodity
                        agreements in general and commodity control agreements—the former were for
                        the purpose of expanding production or consumption and need not fulfill very
                        strict conditions since they did not constitute an additional barrier to
                        international trade. But the purpose of control agreements was to limit
                        production or to regulate prices and tended to place obstacles to trade.
                        Therefore, such an agreement should take place only under specific
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>3. Levels of Prices.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of proposals which would spell out criteria for price
                        determination under an agreement, such as the costs of equipment, the prices
                        of many products for consumption, etc., which would suggest higher prices
                        for primary products than might otherwise be indicated by the present
                        wording, “prices fair to consumers and remunerative to efficient
                        producers”.</p>
                    <p>4. Extension of the term “primary commodity” to include manufactured
                        articles.</p>
                    <p>Uruguay has introduced an amendment to have the term “primary commodity”
                        include not only “any product of farm, forest or fishery or any mineral, in
                        its natural form or which has undergone such processing as is customarily
                        required to prepare it for marketing in substantial volume in international
                        trade”, but also “the industrial equipment required for processing” such
                        products (farm machinery, etc.). The amendment was supported by Argentina,
                        Mexico, and Turkey.</p>
                    <p>The United States and the United Kingdom opposed the proposal largely on the
                        ground that it would not achieve its purpose. The delegate from Australia
                        pointed out that the great range of manufactured goods was not capable of
                        being introduced into a Commodity Agreement, although an individual
                        agreement could perhaps refer to certain related technical equipment.</p>

                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Out of 58 delegations, 35 had favored unit voting, of which 3 (<hi

                            >U.K.</hi> had favored a light weighted voting, with support from <hi

                            rend="italic">Sweden</hi>. The U.S. alone had spoken in terms of a heavy

                    <p>No action was taken and the Chairman postponed the matter for further

                    <p>There are various methods of counting amendments so that figures will vary
                        considerably. The U.S. analysis, however, shows 602 amendments introduced.
                        Of these, the Latin American countries introduced more than one-half (341),
                        with Mexico leading all countries with 85, and Argentina second with 73.</p>
                    <p>Countries which had participated in the meetings of the Preparatory Committee
                        submitted a total of 166, of which 53 were accounted for by Chile and Cuba.
                        Of the 602 amendments submitted, 432 would appear to be so generally or
                        fundamentally in opposition to the Geneva Draft of the Charter as to
                        necessitate their rejection.</p>

                    <p>Australians give strongest assurances their position Geneva and Havana not
                        influenced slightest by lack support U.S. regarding question eligibility
                        Australia participate election thirteenth Director Fund. Australian Govt
                        fully appreciates attitude U.S. in relation fourteenth Directorship.</p>

                        late stage Geneva discussions.</p>
                    <p>Australia maintains that while Fund should be fully consulted by <gloss

                        which affect its special responsibilities, it would be wrong in principle
                        for the “final decision” on issues arising under Trade Charter to rest with
                        another organization parallel but not superior in status to <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Since Australian amendment proposes not merely that Fund would have right to
                        be consulted but that special weight would be given its opinions, Australia
                        thinks Fund would have all protection it could reasonably ask for its own
                        interest and status.</p>
                    <p>As member Fund Australia anxious promote its success. Feels more harm than
                        good might be done by attempting expand Fund’s authority at expense other
                        international organizations.</p>
                    <p>Australians recognize Clayton difficulties with Congress but also has
                        Parliament and people which have been induced only with greatest difficulty
                        accept Bretton Woods. Govt feel still active opposition in Australia to
                        Bretton Woods might easily extend to Trade Charter if key clause in Charter
                        were to be administered in last resort by Fund.</p>
                    <p>Australia feels its proposed amendment goes long way towards meeting U.S.</p>
                    <p>Australia sees no need under its amendment for <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> create any additional machinery or organization for

                    <p>Ambassador stated this message came direct from Prime Minister. We regretted
                        Australia not able agree our proposal and reiterated this was crucial issue
                        for U.S. which might make all difference our attitude Charter.</p>

                        own and any agreements reached should not be conditional on any action at

                        of proposal for bargaining purposes at Hab is therefore not desirable.
                        Understanding of these facts however should help to counteract indifference
                        of other American countries to European recovery to which you refer.
                        Detailed outline of <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> as presented to
                        Congress airmailed you today.</p>
                    <p>The proposal may be summarized briefly as follows:</p>
                    <p>Both European recovery and continued prosperity of Western Hemisphere require
                        solution to problem of financing export surplus to Western Europe of other
                        American countries as well as United States. We expect other American
                        countries to contribute to this financing. We recognize, however, that
                        financial contribution which these countries can make is limited.
                        Consequently, we have recommended to Congress expenditure of United States
                        funds to finance exports from other American countries. Such funds would, of
                        course, provide dollars to pay for imports from the United States. In view
                        of large volume of exports called for from other American countries
                        (including Canada) and limited ability of many of other countries to provide
                        financing, dollar expenditures for this purpose should be substantial.
                        Justification presented to Congress, covering the period April 1, 1948
                        through June 30, 1949, will be based on estimate of $2.6 billion for this
                        purpose. [Daniels and Smith.]</p>

                    <p>This meeting was called at the initiative of the United States in order to
                        resolve the differences in viewpoint between Canada and the United States
                        regarding the subsidy provisions of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        Charter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brown summarized the subsidy amendment suggested by the American
                        Delegation at Havana. This amendment would prohibit export subsidies on
                        manufactured goods but would permit them on agricultural products. However,
                        such export subsidies on agricultural products are not to be used to acquire
                        a share of the market in the particular product in excess of the share
                        prevailing in a previous representative period. If any export subsidization
                        should cause or threaten serious prejudice to the interest of other members
                        and consultation fails to result in a limitation of the subsidy so as to
                        avoid such prejudice, the organization may authorize a complaining member to
                        suspend the application to the subsidizing member of such obligations or
                        concessions under the Charter as the organization determines to be
                        appropriate. The foregoing provisions providing for historical shares of the
                        market and for procedures for complaint and possible penalization in the
                        event of serious prejudice to other members, would apply not only to export
                        subsidies but to all types of subsidization, domestic or otherwise,
                        affecting exports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Deutsch thereupon presented Canada’s position, including its objections
                        to the subsidy amendment proposed by the United States. Firstly, he pointed
                        out that whereas the United States was objecting to the present requirement
                        in the Geneva Draft Charter for prior approval for the use of export
                        subsidies, it was insisting on prior approval for the use of quantitative
                        restrictions for economic development and in other instances. Canada shared
                        the United States conviction for the necessity of prior approval with regard
                        to “<gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>”, and for the same reasons that it
                        deemed prior approval desirable in this case, it also considered prior
                        approval to be desirable in connection with export subsidies.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, he argued that the representative period formula suggested in the
                        American amendment was vague, indefinite and <pb n="821" xml:id="pg_821"
                            facs="0331"/>difficult to apply. He believed that the American subsidy
                        proposal in fact gave no substantial protection against the use of export
                        subsidies and their injurious consequences.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, Mr. Deutsch argued that since export subsidies were less expensive
                        and thus easier to apply than domestic subsidies, it was desirable that the
                        Charter provisions on export subsidies should be tighter than those on
                        domestic subsidies. He pointed out that the greater expensiveness resulting
                        from the subsidization of the entire output of a particular commodity, as
                        would be the case under a domestic subsidy, would serve as an effective
                        restraining influence on the employment of such subsidies. Since an export
                        subsidy involves payment only on the proportion which is exported and not on
                        the total output, it is less expensive and hence there is not as effective a
                        restraint to the use of such subsidies as there is in the case of domestic
                        subsidies.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Mr. Wood and Mr. Wheeler pointed out that in general export
                        subsidies in the United States are incidental to this country’s agricultural
                        price support program, and that the United States has not employed export
                        subsidies, with possibly one exception or so, to acquire an undue share of
                        the market. They emphasized the fact that the United States price support
                        program has been ingrained in domestic legislation at least since the early
                        1930’s and that the United States Congress could not accept any Charter
                        which in practice might prohibit the use of export subsidies and impair the
                        price support program. This was a hard, practical fact which could not be
                        overlooked and which is crucial in the United States position regarding
                        subsidies.</p>
                    <p>Issue was taken with Mr. Deutsch’s contentions regarding the reasonableness
                        of the present Charter distinction between domestic and export subsidies. It
                        was argued that countries exporting the predominant proportion of a
                        particular product, such as Canada in the case of wheat, would in effect be
                        employing an export subsidy even though in form the subsidization was not
                        applied directly on exports and would be considered “domestic” in terms of
                        the Charter.</p>
                    <p>It was also argued that the subsidy amendment proposed by the United States
                        should assure adequate protection to Canada as well as other countries
                        against the injurious use of export subsidies. First, the United States
                        formula offered a restraint by restricting export subsidies so that they
                        would not result in shares of the market in excess of those prevailing in a
                        previous representative period. Secondly, the formula afforded an additional
                        restraint in that a price would have to be paid, namely the withdrawal with
                        respect to an offending member of obligations or concessions under the
                        Charter, if subsidies were used so as either to cause or threaten serious
                        prejudice to other members of the organization.</p>
                    <pb n="822" xml:id="pg_822" facs="0332"/>
                    <p>Mr. Deutsch disputed the effectiveness of the safeguards afforded by the
                        American formula and the United States contentions regarding the inequity of
                        the present Charter distinction between domestic and export subsidies. He
                        pointed out that although on a representative period basis the United States
                        might foe accorded a share of the market in a particular product, it might
                        not be able to achieve such a share on the basis of comparative
                            advantage,<note n="1" xml:id="d130fn1">According to this theory a
                            country specializes in those products in which it achieves the greatest
                            relative efficiency in production.</note> a principle which, he noted,
                        presumably underlies the objectives of the Charter. He recognized the
                        political difficulties involved in the United States acceptance of the
                        Geneva provisions on export subsidies. He pointed out, however, that Canada
                        has comparable political problems and that the Charter now contains
                        provisions which it would be very difficult to accept in his country. For
                        example, although the Charter would permit quantitative restrictions on
                        agricultural products, it would not permit them (subject, of course, to
                        balance of payments and other similar exceptions) on manufactured products.
                        He indicated that this distinction is of great concern to a country like
                        Canada which is vitally dependent on markets abroad for its agricultural
                        exports and which at the same time has manufacturing interests to
                        consider.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wood indicated his appreciation of the Canadian position but inquired
                        whether it might not be possible to work out some formula which would
                        adequately safeguard Canadian interests and at the same time permit
                        acceptance of the Charter by the United States Congress. Mr. Deutsch,
                        emphasizing that he was speaking off the cuff and was not making a firm
                        proposal, inquired whether the United States would be agreeable to dropping
                        all the subsidy provisions in the Geneva Draft except Article 25. In effect
                        this suggestion would mean that the Charter provisions on subsidies would be
                        identical with those in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr.
                        Wheeler indicated that such a proposal would be acceptable to the Department
                        of Agriculture. Mr. Brown stated that although we had not given previous
                        consideration to such a suggestion, he felt that the United States would
                        probably prefer to see the Charter retain some provisions on the order of
                        our proposed amendment restricting the use of export subsidies rather than
                        simply relying on the general consultative provisions of Article 25.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brown inquired whether, in view of the fact that the Canadians seemed to
                        be troubled by the distinction made in the United States subsidy amendment
                        between export subsidies on primary products and those on manufactured
                        goods, Canada might foe agreeable to accepting subsidy provisions which
                        would treat manufactured and non-manufactured <pb n="823" xml:id="pg_823"
                            facs="0333"/>products on the same level. In other words, rather than
                        prohibit outright export subsidies on manufactured goods, as the present
                        United States amendment would do, Mr. Brown suggested that the
                        representative period limitation now applicable in the United States
                        amendment only to agricultural products be also applied to manufactured
                        products, so that export subsidies on such products would be permitted if
                        they did not result in a share of the market in excess of that prevailing in
                        a previous representative period. If such subsidies on manufactured products
                        caused or threatened serious prejudice, the procedure in the present United
                        States amendment for withdrawal of obligations or concessions under the
                        Charter would apply. Mr. Deutsch indicated that he would give this proposal
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Deutsch made a further suggestion with a view to ensuring greater
                        safeguards in the application of the representative period formula. He
                        inquired whether the United States would be agreeable to accepting, in the
                        event of disagreement regarding the appropriate representative period on
                        which to base export shares, final determination by the organization. He
                        felt that such a procedure would subject the selection of the representative
                        period to a relatively impartial and objective party rather than to a
                        particular interested country as would be the case under the present United
                        States proposal. The State Department’s representatives indicated that Mr.
                        Deutsch’s proposal seemed reasonable enough and appeared acceptable. Mr.
                        Wheeler concurred for the Department of Agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wood emphasized the necessity for trying to reach a reconciliation of
                        views on this question. Mr. Deutsch stated that he was leaving for Ottawa on
                        Thursday and would consider the various suggestions made at this meeting
                        with his people as soon as he returned to Canada. He thought that he would
                        be able to give us a definitive answer by Saturday. He stated that in the
                        interim he would get in touch with Mr. Wilgress<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2"
                            >Leolyn D. Wilgress, Head, Canadian Delegation at Habana.</note> in
                        Habana regarding the question. We indicated that we would consult with Mr.
                        Wilcox and others regarding the various suggestions made at this
                            meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">In reporting this conversation, the
                            Department in telegram 762 to Habana, December 30, advised the United
                            States Delegation that pending receipt of the Canadian Government’s
                            reaction, “we believe acceptance Organization determination
                            representative period and elimination difference treatment between

                                3, the Department advised the delegation in Habana, that the
                                Canadians had reluctantly accepted the general proposition that
                                subsidies would be subject to <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                                determination as to whether they were representative.

                        issue which Clair [Wilcox] poses is which of three possible alternatives we
                        should follow in connection with the conference. He thinks it unlikely that
                        we will be able to get wide agreement on a Charter which is close enough to
                        the Geneva draft to satisfy us. He outlines three alternatives: (1) to try
                        to get 25 or 30 countries to agree to a strong and satisfactory Charter; (2)
                        to get general agreement on some of the chapters and sections, and adjourn
                        consideration of the balance to a definite later date; (3) to accept a
                        “skeleton” Charter without substantive provisions which merely sets up a
                        consultative body.</p>
                    <p>Clair feels that if the first course is followed, we should be in a position
                        to get Congressional action at the 1948 session, and have at least a
                        fifty-fifty chance that such action would be favorable. He suggests
                        consultation with Senator Vandenberg on this point. He points out that to
                        secure such action would require the maximum push from the Department at the
                        very top, and hopes you will be able to talk to the Secretary and Under
                        Secretary about it.</p>
                    <p>Clair thinks that if the second course were followed, we would not be too
                        badly off, as we could hold the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        countries (except possibly for 3 or 4 countries). Adjournment would mean, of
                        course, that the Charter would not come to Congress until 1949. In this
                        event, he feels it most important that we seek renewal of the Trade
                        Agreements Act at the 1948 session.</p>
                    <p>My own conviction, of course, is that we ought to seek that renewal in any
                        event, probably on a single-year basis, because if we do not, we will appear
                        to other countries to have abandoned our policy of economic cooperation in
                        the trade field and to have returned to the pre-Hull tariff policy, and will
                        let down all our supporters in the United States. Public support is now
                        stronger than it ever has been before, and I am sure that all we need to
                        make that support effective is to give it leadership. If we do not, it will
                        be dissipated.</p>

                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> might look like, and we will have complete

                        <item>There would seem to be only three main ways of achieving some degree
                            of success in the face of threatened failure: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            appeal to “principles”, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) offering of economic
                            benefits not now otherwise in prospect, and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                            threatening various sanctions. It is my feeling that the appeal to
                            “principles” has not been utilized as fully at Habana as it might be.
                            Offering of economic benefits on a large scale is difficult under the
                            circumstances, but offerings to the Latinos in connection with Bogotá,
                            or in connection with the European Recovery Program, would seem to be
                            the most fruitful. Threats have not been fully exploited, although the
                            Wilcox speech of December 23 should have opened the eyes of some of the
                            delegates. Apparently other countries just do not believe that the
                            United States would use its economic power to drive hard and
                            discriminatory bargains, in the absence of an international code. They
                            apparently think we would behave in exemplary fashion, with certain
                            exceptions (mainly agricultural), regardless of the existence of a code.
                            Although such exemplary behavior might be attempted for a short while, I
                            believe most close observers of American economics and politics would
                            agree that it would give way to hardboiled economic warfare.</item>

                    <p>It would seem appropriate for us to employ a balanced combination of all
                        three methods: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) stress “principles” more strongly
                        than we have thus far, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) hold out the possibility

                            Opposition of Canada this issue might prove fatal. Agreement between
                            Washington and Ottawa should prevent defeat. Unlikely we could get US
                            amendment adopted but should be able obtain compromise acceptable to

                            vote against charter provisions. Cannot compromise on principle of prior
                            approval but should be able to obtain majority with minor changes in

                            Central American states, but difficult to obtain concession there. If we
                            went further would alienate British Commonwealth, Brazil. Have promised

                        Govt to which you are accredited might result in more flexible and possibly

                    <p>Bolivia is represented by Ambassador to Cuba. There is no evidence any study
                        of draft Charter prepared by the 18-nation Prep Com which included Cuba,
                        Brazil and Chile. Utterly impossible one official, with other duties, to
                        represent adequately interests his country at international Conf. US
                        recognizes financial difficulties small countries in sending out Delegations
                        to many international conferences. But beyond not having special
                        representation, local Ambassador has appeared at meetings and has made
                        violent speeches generally irrelevant to substance of Charter. When he
                        occasionally speaks to issues it is in support of extreme Chilean or
                        Argentine amendments (see <hi rend="italic">g</hi> above).</p>
                    <p>Question posed is whether Bolivian interests actually served by their support
                        of Argentina whose apparent objective is opposition to <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> project. Might be pointed out for Bolivian
                        consideration that draft Geneva Charter generally supported by widely
                        representative Prep Com. Considering that this Com included appropriate
                        representation underdeveloped countries in situations similar to that of
                        Bolivia it would seem to follow that Geneva Charter must contain substance

                    <p>27. <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 24, January 26. Minister of
                        Industry Farina spoke at length and with apparent frankness regarding Habana
                        Conference problems. At outset he brought up Wilcox speech December 23,
                        declaring it had been widely interpreted by Latinos as threat on part US and
                        hence not well received. In fact Minister attributed many of our subsequent
                        difficulties to that statement and alleged “unfriendly way in which
                        delivered”. I thereupon produced speech and said that while unable comment
                        on circumstances delivery I thought that by pointing out so plainly effects
                        of indiscriminate economic warfare, statement should have and I hoped had
                        cleared air. Minister reiterated speech widely interpreted by Latinos as US
                        threat and hence responsible for galvanizing their opposition. He also was
                        somewhat critical alleged tactical errors our delegation in dealing Latin
                        American delegates declaring in effect we had gone about selling our bill of
                        goods in wrong way. Problem of industrial countries versus “undeveloped
                        countries” debated and Minister admitted that on record our government has
                        certainly shown no lack sympathetic interest problems other American
                        Republics, He also volunteered that Uruguay would be unjustified adopting
                        position “all industrialization is good” but should concentrate on
                        processing products such as wool, leather and linseed available this
                        country. It should be noted that President of Uruguay apparently not in
                        agreement this thesis (please see Embassy despatch 20, December 18).<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d138fn1">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Farina expressed opinion that in spite technical nature Charter and economic
                        matters related thereto, conference really political meeting and should have
                        been so understood by our government, that is, we should have more delegates
                        cognizant inter-American political relations and accustomed dealing Latinos.
                        (He spoke in very friendly terms of Nufer.)</p>
                    <p>Finally and not withstanding foregoing observations Minister said he
                        understood conference now making better progress and expressed confidence
                        agreement would eventually be reached as well as recognition importance not
                        having meeting end in failure. His only concrete suggestion in that
                        connection was possibility of deferring entry into effect of Charter for
                        specified number of years or “until end postwar transition period”.</p>

                        Castro (head unofficial organization Uruguay <pb n="838" xml:id="pg_838"
                            facs="0348"/>businessmen interested expanding trade with US) and myself.
                        Farina asked that his comments be considered personal and off record. For
                        that reason and because nature Minister’s criticism cable sent Department
                        only.</p>
                    <p>Farina impressed me favorably in that he seemed genuinely well-disposed and
                        to be making sincere effort explain reasons for conference difficulties with
                        Latin American delegations. While some of complaints cited seemed rather
                        trivial (for example, he said our pressure tactics seeking to hold sessions
                        on New Year’s day had incensed Latinos) nevertheless if Farina’s views as
                        widely shared as he asserts, his comments may assist Department in
                        evaluating present situation, as well as explaining somewhat hostile tone
                        statements emanating in recent weeks from other American Republics.</p>

                    <p>118. For Brown and Treasury from Wilcox and Bronz. In connection with our
                        110, January 27 we request advice on assuming offensive on Article 23 by
                        proposing new provision forbidding discrimination based on inconvertible
                        currency held for more than say one year.</p>
                    <p>We have heretofore relied upon Section 10 (II) of Anglo-American financial
                            agreement<note n="1" xml:id="d139fn1">
                            <gloss target="#t_TIAS1">TIAS</gloss> No. 1545 or 61 Stat, (part 2)
                            1841.</note> to protect US against trade discrimination based on
                        accumulated sterling balances. If this provision does not stand up, we would
                        be left with Charter Article which is not an adequate safeguard. If Britain
                        keeps sterling inconvertible indefinitely, that fact alone might well
                        constitute the widespread disequilibrium required under Article 23 and it
                        would thereby be possible for holders of accumulated sterling balances, with
                            <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> approval, to give British goods
                        preference indefinitely.</p>

                    <p>French will contend this position may prevent Czechs and Poles from joining

                            Paris, not printed, Ambassador Caffery reported that he had conveyed the
                            Department’s views to Hervé Alphand, Director of the Economic Section of
                            the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The initial French response was
                            deemed unsatisfactory, and the Ambassador reported in telegram 659 from
                            Paris, not printed, that he had met with Foreign Minister Bidault on
                            February 5, to discuss the Department’s position. The French had not
                            come to accept the United States view, but, upon the Ambassador’s
                            urging, agreed to reconsider the matter. Caffery added that “I am not at

                    <p>This memorandum deals only with the French proposals for amending Article 23.
                        These proposals do not constitute our only problem on Article 23, because
                        there are equally important amendments proposed by the UK, Belgium,
                        Czechoslovakia, Norway, Denmark and Italy, all of which seem to have
                        attracted a fair to considerable amount of support from the other European
                        countries, plus amendments by Mexico and Syria-Lebanon which are still
                        pending. The Subcommittee has rejected amendments by Argentina and Uruguay
                        to this Article. Thus, any decision on the French points will not settle the
                        question of this Article. All of the other proposals still pending would
                        make serious breaches in multilateralism in favor of bilateralism.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d143fn1">Article 23 was intended to define the exceptions
                            to the rule of nondiscrimination permissible to <gloss target="#t_ITO1"

                    <p>The two French amendments deal with what have come to be known popularly as
                        “Little Two” and the “<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Clause”. They
                        will be disscused in turn.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">I. “<hi rend="italic">Little Two</hi>”</p>
                    <p>Article 23, paragraph 1(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (ii), known as “Little
                        Two”, provides that discriminatory import restrictions may be used under
                        certain conditions, provided that: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“the Member taking such action does not do so as part of any
                                arrangement by which the gold or convertible currency which the
                                Member currently receives directly or indirectly from its exports to
                                other Members not party to the arrangement is appreciably reduced
                                below the level it could otherwise have been reasonably expected to
                                attain.”</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>The first French attack on this provision consisted of a prepared statement
                        in the Subcommittee (restricted document not issued to the press) arguing
                        that this clause would permit the U.S., because of its financial position,
                        to corner the world’s markets in important commodities either for military
                        strategic reasons or for monopolistic purposes. It could be used for
                        “unjustified profits” and “to acquire a powerful instrument for political
                        domination.” In addition, they said the clause would prevent effective
                        European cooperation as contemplated by the Marshall Plan and would give the
                        U.S. an immoral <pb n="842" xml:id="pg_842" facs="0352"/>monopoly of the
                        opportunity to help its neighbors. Despite repeated explanations both in
                        Subcommittee and in private, pointing out that the provisions could not in
                        any way have that effect, the French have persistently reverted to this
                        theme.</p>
                    <p>In order to avoid political misrepresentation of the provision, such as the
                        French have resorted to, we have redrafted “Little Two” in four different
                        ways and offered the French their choice. These new drafts avoid reference
                        to gold and convertible currencies, thus taking the finger off the United
                        States, but do not change the substance of “Little Two”. The four versions
                        we have offered the French are attached as Exhibit A.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d143fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The French formally submitted an amendment which would change this clause
                        into simply a guarantee that France would provide the U.S. with its pre-war
                        share of French exports. Later the French and British jointly submitted a
                        redraft which is so obscure and qualified as to extract all real meaning
                        from “Little Two”. These two proposals are attached as Exhibit B.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d143fn3">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The practical effect of “Little Two” which we have insisted upon in all of
                        our redrafts is that bilateral agreements must not involve readily saleable
                        commodities in good demand. Through our long discussions at Geneva, the
                        justification offered by the European countries for bilateral trade
                        arrangements was based purely on examples of unsaleable luxuries which
                        cannot be disposed of in the open market because of austerity policies.
                        Whatever justification there may be for limited and temporary permission for
                        discriminatory bilateral agreements covering such commodities, there can be
                        no justification for bilateralism applicable to coal, steel, heavy
                        chemicals, timber, etc., which can be freely sold either on a competitive
                        price basis or in accordance with international allocations for which
                        adequate provision appears in the Charter (Article 43).</p>
                    <p>The French and the British would like to continue making bilateral trade
                        agreements covering the whole field of their trade with the countries
                        involved. By lumping together perfumes and steel in an overall bilateral
                        agreement, it will be difficult for the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        ever to point to any particular discrimination and condemn it. The net
                        result would likely be that bilateralism would continue to constitute the
                        whole basis of European trade, and multilateralism will be only a constantly
                        receding hope. If the exportable surpluses of such commodities as coal,
                        steel, chemicals, and timber, which are expected to appear in a number of
                        European countries within the coming year are taken out of the field of
                        bilateralism, we will have a real step toward the multilateralism which we
                        have always said is the main aim of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        Charter.</p>
                    <pb n="843" xml:id="pg_843" facs="0353"/>
                    <p>The French argue that the Marshall Plan could not be carried out except
                        through comprehensive bilateralism. They make this statement in the face of
                        the report of the <gloss target="#t_CEEC1">CEEC</gloss>, which states that
                        multilateralism is the aim of the <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss>, and
                        that it should supersede bilateralism during the progress of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> itself. If some break is not made in the
                        near future, we may have lost our last real opportunity to get Europe
                        started on the road to multilateralism.</p>

                                >GATT</gloss> Clause</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>You will recall that you agreed with Sir Stafford Cripps in Paris last July
                        that there should be a one-year breathing spell, giving the UK a free hand
                        on discrimination. What Cripps and you had in mind was that within the year
                        we would know whether or not there would be a Marshall Plan.</p>
                    <p>On the day when Articles 21, 23 and 24 were scheduled for final action in
                        Geneva, Baraduc of the French Delegation came to me and said France could
                        not accept these Articles unless it were given a one-year breathing spell on
                        discrimination. Apparently, the French did not know of the agreement you had
                        already made with Cripps, else they would not have bargained for what you
                        already promised Cripps. I agreed to the French conditions and at the French
                        request, embodied the agreement in a written memorandum initialed by Baraduc
                        and myself. This memorandum was vague on the length of the free period for
                        discrimination but said explicitly that the agreement related only to the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and not the Charter. The same
                        afternoon the British and French participated in the meeting at Geneva and
                        joined in approving the text of Article 23 without any provision for a free
                        period of discrimination.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, in negotiating <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, we went
                        further than your agreement with Cripps and my agreement with Baraduc. The
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provision covered almost one and
                        one-half years (against the one-year we had earlier talked about), giving
                        complete freedom for discrimination to January 1, 1949. In addition, the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> went on: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p rend="flushleft">“provided that this period may with the concurrence
                                of the <hi rend="italic">contracting parties</hi> be extended for
                                such further periods as they may specify in respect of any
                                contracting party whose supply of convertible currencies is
                                inadequate to enable it to apply the above-mentioned
                                provisions”.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>We agreed to this clause in contemplation of the fact that our understandings
                        with the British and French explicitly excluded any free period for
                        discrimination in the Charter itself. However, it is true that under the
                        terms of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> a country could refuse to
                        sign the Charter and hold to this <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        provision. <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is binding until <pb
                            n="844" xml:id="pg_844" facs="0354"/>January 1, 1951, after which any
                        country can drop out on six months’ notice.</p>
                    <p>The British have proposed to us, but not in any formal amendment submitted to
                        the Conference, that the date January 1, 1949 be changed to March 1, 1952.
                        This obviously goes far beyond what Cripps asked for in Paris, and will
                        carry the free period on discrimination to approximately the end rather than
                        the beginning of the Marshall Plan, The French have simply asked to write
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provision into the Charter, which
                        would mean that the proviso for the extension of the free discrimination
                        period would permit the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> to authorize
                        unlimited discrimination forever for particular countries, which, by the
                        process of log-rolling, might turn out to be everybody but the U.S.</p>
                    <p>I do not think we should agree to either of these proposals. I do not think
                        it will be any easier for the European countries to make a first partial
                        break away from discrimination in 1950 or 1951 or 1952 than it will be in
                        1949. Quite the contrary. The longer they continue with bilateralism the
                        harder it will be ever to get them away from it. The proviso clause is
                        extremely dangerous under a voting procedure where a majority of the votes
                        will be cast by countries which have been engaged in bilateral trade.</p>
                    <p>If we have to make any concessions at all, I think the most easily defensible
                        one would be an acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        clause with the January 1, 1949 date, but with the proviso clause limited to
                        January 1, 1951, which is the period for which we may be said to have
                        committed ourselves in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. We are
                        under no obligation to either the British or French to do this, and we have
                        an explicit memorandum with the French covering the point. But it would be
                        the easiest concession to justify in Congress because this memorandum is not
                        public.</p>

                        worked out in collaboration with the Australians and the United States.</p>
                    <p>In a recent meeting of the Heads of Delegations, Mr. Beteta took the position
                        that no issues on which agreement had been reached during the past two
                        months were to be regarded as closed, that all agreements could be reopened
                        by the new Coordinating Committee, and, finally, that adoption by this
                        Conference of a Charter that was acceptable to a majority of the countries
                        here would mean that the countries of Latin America could not accept it.
                        Later on he contended <pb n="846" xml:id="pg_846" facs="0356"/>that no
                        Charter should be adopted here unless agreement on it was unanimous. In this
                        he is simply parrotting the position repeatedly taken by Charlone, of
                        Uruguay.</p>
                    <p>This radical alteration in the Mexican position follows the return of Beteta
                        from a long stay in Mexico City.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>You should have a frank talk with Beteta about the present basis of our
                        relations. You should keep in mind the fact that we can withdraw our
                        agreement to every concession that we have so far made to them. You should
                        also keep in mind the fact that negotiations for further modification of the
                        trade agreement in their interest await the termination of the Havana
                        Conference.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Paul</hi>: I am enclosing a copy of a statement
                        signed by sixteen Latin American countries proposing the appointment of a
                        coordinating group for the purpose of seeking “harmonious solutions” of the
                        several problems still confronting the Conference.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d145fn1">This conference document is not printed here.</note>
                        Sr. César Charlone, President of the Uruguayan Delegation, read the
                        statement at the Heads of Delegations meeting on January 31, 1948.</p>
                    <p>We had been informed of the Latinos plans several days before the meeting by
                        Sr. Braga, the head of the Brazilian Delegation, who also furnished us with
                        a confidential advance copy of the statement. The statement is not too
                        objectionable and differs widely from the original version drafted by
                        Charlone himself which was much more provocative. It was toned down at the
                        request of the Brazilian, Colombian, Peruvian and other more moderate Latin
                        American delegates who refused to go along with the Charlone draft.
                        Charlone, incidentally, was the author of the plan. In view of his open
                        opposition to some of the basic principles of the Charter it does not seem
                        improbable that he conceived it in the hope that it would be rejected and
                        that this would afford him an opportunity to convince his Latin American
                        colleagues that the U.S. and other industrialized nations were definitely
                        opposed to the “just aspirations” of the underdeveloped countries in general
                        and of our good neighbors in particular.</p>
                    <p>While we realized that the establishment of the proposed coordinating group
                        was undesirable in view of the danger that its “conciliatory <pb n="847"
                            xml:id="pg_847" facs="0357"/>efforts”, no matter how conducted, might
                        interfere with the work of the Committees and Subcommittees, Gerry
                            Smith<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">H. Gerald Smith, Special Assistant to
                            the Director of the Office of American Republic Affairs had recently
                            arrived in Habana to aid the United States delegation.</note> and I
                        strongly recommended that we not oppose the Latinos on this issue, as we
                        felt that if we did so it would create a difficult and unfavorable
                        atmosphere which Uruguay, Argentina and perhaps others would make every
                        effort to exploit in their favor.</p>
                    <p>It was therefore decided to go along with the Latinos and at the January 31
                        meeting, after Charlone had read the attached statement and the several
                        Committee heads had reported on the progress of the work to date, Mr. Wilcox
                        took the floor and supported the proposal, moving that the General Committee
                        proceed forthwith to set up the proposed group, deciding upon its
                        composition, points of reference, etc., etc. A copy of Mr. Wilcox’s
                        statement is also enclosed.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        Our support came as a complete surprise to most of the Latinos and it was
                        quite obvious that the wind was taken out of the sails of Charlone and some
                        of his friends who, I am informed, had prepared lengthy and impassioned
                        speeches in favor of their proposal.</p>
                    <p>Our gesture has, I believe, had a very favorable effect on those of the Latin
                        American Delegations which, while not always seeing eye to eye with us on
                        the outstanding issues, are trying to harmonize conflicting viewpoints and
                        to bring the Conference to an early and successful conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Gerry Smith just told me that he had intended to write you regarding the
                        above developments so that you may consider this letter as coming from both
                        of us. Incidentally, Gerry is a very welcome addition to the Delegation. His
                        presence in Havana will not only give him a good deal of valuable background
                        for the Bogotá Conference, but should be very helpful to us in our efforts
                        to keep our relations with the Latin American Delegations on as even a keel
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>With kindest regards and best wishes, believe me.</p>

                    <p>105. 1. US Del at <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Conference Habana
                        encountering difficulties with Brazilian Del re subsidy provisions <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter. Brazilians proposing provisions
                        which would prevent a country from using export subsidy if <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> should find that trade of country using
                        export subsidy would not be seriously prejudiced if it were not permitted to
                        use such subsidy.</p>
                    <p>2. This provision not acceptable to US. There is no prospect of US Congress
                        accepting Charter which would subject to <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        approval, as Brazilian proposal in effect does, right US to use export
                        subsidies. Member Brazilian Del advised US Del confidentially he would agree
                        dropping their proposal but states difficulty is in Rio, which is unmoved by
                        view its Del Habana, and suggests we take matter up in Rio.</p>
                    <p>3. Subsidy provisions now being considered Habana more favorable to Brazil
                        than subsidy provisions in Geneva Draft <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        Charter. Under provisions being considered Habana Art 28 Geneva Draft has
                        been broadened so as to limit all types subsidies affecting exports, not
                        merely subsidies directly on exports. Present redraft Art 28, designed in
                        part to meet Brazilian points, would prevent any subsidy from being used to
                        acquire more than equitable share of market. Geneva draft would leave
                        loophole under Art 26, para 2 for US use processing taxes to, in effect,
                        subsidize exports, and such subsidization would not in any way be limited.
                        Redraft proposed Habana therefore definitely more desirable from Brazilian
                        viewpoint because it would limit use of processing-tax subsidies in same way
                        as straight export subsidies.</p>
                    <p>4. If <gloss target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss> perceives no objection, request you
                        discuss this matter informally along foregoing lines with appropriate
                        officials Brazilian govt with view persuading latter to instruct its Del at
                        Habana to drop its provision described in para 1 above. Dept appreciates
                        Brazilian sensitivity re use US cotton export subsidy in past and that
                        raising issue subsidy provisions Charter may only irritate Brazilians
                        without securing any change in their position. Dept leaves <gloss
                            target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss>’s discretion whether raising Habana
                        question is appropriate and likely yield fruitful results. Since question
                        now under discussion at Habana, essential any action taken be prompt as
                        possible. Pls report Dept and repeat reply to Habana.</p>

                    <p>If I interpreted correctly the sense of this morning’s Delegation meeting, it
                        was that in view of the intransigent attitude of the majority of the Latin
                        American Delegations with respect to <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss> and
                        the seeming futility of our trying to convince them of the error of their
                        ways by making concessions to them on other issues, the time is approaching
                        when our Delegation will have to make a definite and unequivocal statement
                        regarding our position, even at the risk of an open break with the
                        Latinos.</p>
                    <p>I sympathize fully with the feelings of the Delegation in this respect and I
                        have the greatest admiration for the infinite tact and patience which all
                        the Delegates have shown during the long weeks of the Conference in trying
                        to induce the Latinos to recede from their position and to adopt a more
                        constructive attitude towards the Charter. I realize, moreover, that the
                        time may come when a showdown may be unavoidable but I would like strongly
                        to recommend that any such action be postponed until we have explored every
                        possibility of reaching some agreement with the Latinos on <gloss
                            target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>s without receding from our position with
                        regard to prior approval.</p>
                    <p>Despite the arguments advanced this morning, I wonder if it would not be
                        possible to establish some mutually acceptable criteria under Article 13
                        which would govern the decisions of the Conference in passing on
                        applications from Member countries to use <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>
                        for development purposes and whether it would not also be possible to
                        establish some time limit within which the Organization would have to hand
                        down its decisions with regard to such applications. I understand that
                        Article 13 is now being discussed by a Subcommittee or Working Party and
                        that Mr. Fowler<note n="1" xml:id="d147fn1">William A. Fowler, a United
                            States Treasury specialist.</note> believes that the procedure with
                        regard to <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>s can be streamlined and made
                        more acceptable (or perhaps it would be better to say less unacceptable) to
                        the Latin Americans. I also personally feel that our position vis-à-vis the
                        Latin American Delegations would be much strengthened if we could amend
                        Chapter 20, paragraph 2, item (e), so as to make it applicable to industrial
                        products as well as agricultural and fisheries products. The Latinos have
                        argued time and again that, while we reserve the right under certain
                        specified conditions to use <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>s without prior
                        approval on agricultural and fisheries products, we refuse to make this
                        extensive to industrial products and that as they are primarily exporters of
                        agricultural <pb n="850" xml:id="pg_850" facs="0360"/>products and importers
                        of industrial products, it places them in a disadvantageous position.</p>
                    <p>If we can establish some acceptable criteria under Article 13 (without
                        sacrificing the principle of prior approval on <gloss target="#t_QR1"
                            >QR</gloss>s) and meet the Latinos views on Article 20, it <hi
                            rend="italic">might</hi> prevent an open break and if in spite of our
                        efforts along these lines, a break should occur, our position would, I feel,
                        be stronger than it is at present. I am frankly much concerned over the
                        possibility of such a break for several reasons, among which (in addition to
                        the rift in hemispheric solidarity and the possible effects thereof on the
                        Bogotá Conference) are the following: <list>

                            <item>In the event we force a showdown it seems at best doubtful that
                                our views on <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss> will prevail and that
                                we will not be voted down. It does not seem impossible that if the
                                Latin American countries, the Arab League, China, Ceylon and others
                                line up against us, that they will be able to muster a majority.
                                Should such a contingency arise, we would be forced into the
                                position of either accepting this decision or of refusing to abide
                                by the majority rule.</item>

                            <item>An open break with the Latinos, on the other hand, would have
                                far-reaching political consequences in the Western Hemisphere. Also,
                                it would inevitably be exploited by the Soviet Union and by the
                                Communist groups and opposition parties in the several Latin
                                American countries, as well as in other parts of the world. They
                                would endeavor by every means at their disposal to convince the
                                peoples of those countries and the world at large that the
                                Conference failed because the “Capitalist” powers in general and the
                                U.S. in particular had tried to force their views upon the small
                                underdeveloped countries in order to keep them in a semi-colonial
                                state and to prevent them from industrializing. I believe,
                                unfortunately, that such a campaign would win a lot of followers
                                among the peoples of Latin America, who, despite all we have done
                                for them during the last fifteen years, still have a lurking
                                suspicion in their minds of the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of

                    <p>My Govt has requested me to call to your attention that there may be

                        the desire of my Govt that no attempt be made to resolve these questions at
                        this time but rather to discuss them with representatives of your Govt at an
                        appropriate time. Accordingly any <pb n="851" xml:id="pg_851" facs="0361"

                    <p>180. For Clayton. French Govt reply to our representations relating to the
                        amendment to Art. 99 of <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter was
                        received this morning by note from French <gloss target="#t_Emb1"
                            >Emb</gloss>.<note n="1" xml:id="d149fn1">Not printed.</note> French
                        Govt. has taken position that it is not possible to accept immediate
                        extension of Chapter 3 of the Charter to Germany but is prepared to agree
                        after a period of trial that Germany might enjoy nondiscriminatory
                        treatment. The note states that French Delegation in Habana has pointed out
                        that only the occupying powers are in a position to determine whether the
                        obligations which they have taken or will take in regard to Germany are
                        consistent with other obligations and that consequently the Conference is
                        not in a position to deal with the questions raised by American amendment
                        because it is unable to decide whether acceptance of this amendment would
                        raise questions incompatible with other international undertakings. For this
                        reason French Delegation proposed to transform US amendment into a
                        conference resolution wherein the hope would be expressed that the occupying
                        powers responsible for the economic policy of Germany would inform the
                            <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> organization as soon as possible of
                        the decisions taken in this respect. The note continues that French Foreign
                        Minister has already pointed out that France is unable to accept any
                        procedure which would involve discussion of the future of Germany by 50
                        nations at Habana less interested in the question than France and in a
                        setting where France’s voice might not be heard. Consequently it is proposed
                        that this subject be discussed at the forthcoming Tripartite Conference on
                        Germany which is scheduled to begin in London on Feb. 19.<note n="2"

                    <p>When this note was received, it was pointed out orally to the French <gloss
                            target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss>. that in fact it constituted a refusal on
                        the part of France to recommend the principle of nondiscrimination against
                        exports from the Western Zones of Germany during the period of occupation.
                        Emphasis was laid on the points which you had stressed in your conversation
                        with Berard<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">Armand Bérard, Minister-Counselor of
                            the French Embassy.</note> and we stated again that the position now <pb
                            n="852" xml:id="pg_852" facs="0362"/>taken by France might have serious
                        consequences with respect to the European Recovery Program as well as
                        prejudicing the possible acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> Charter. Furthermore we explained that postponement of
                        discussions to the London Conference which would only be binding on the
                        three participating countries might make it impossible for any discussions
                        in Habana. French <gloss target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss>. was asked once more
                        to make these points clear to Paris and requested to solicit a further
                        explanation of reasons why France was not prepared to agree to
                        nondiscrimination against exports from Western Germany. Copy of note and

                        to Chauvel on this subject (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 296,
                        January 30). There follows in translation text of Foreign Office letter in
                        reply dated February 10.</p>
                    <p>“You have been good enough to draw my attention to the position taken by our
                        delegation at the conference at Habana with respect to the amendment to
                        Article 99 presented by the American delegation.</p>
                    <p>The proposals of the Department of State have been made the object of careful
                        examination by the services of the Ministry. This examination has resulted
                        in the conclusion that the so-called proposals are acceptable with respect
                        to substance (<hi rend="italic">quant au fond</hi>), but are not acceptable
                        with regard to their method of application.</p>
                    <p>The conference assembled at Habana, indeed, does not have competence to deal
                        with the question raised by your amendment. Only the occupying powers in
                        Germany can judge whether the engagements which they take or are prepared to
                        take with respect to the foreign trade of Germany are or are not in
                        contravention with other engagements of an international character
                        undertaken by them.</p>
                    <p>Besides, it is difficult to understand that questions concerning Germany,
                        which were originally made, up to the end of December, the objective of
                        tripartite examination and which have, in fact, been discussed on a
                        bilateral basis since the beginning of January, should now be considered by
                        50 nations.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we cannot admit that the whole of the charter, and more
                        especially Chapter III concerning economic development, could apply
                        immediately to Germany which, by being placed with respect to its
                        reconstruction on the same footing as the allied countries <pb n="854"
                            xml:id="pg_854" facs="0364"/>devastated by the war, would immediately
                        prejudice the restoration of these countries.</p>
                    <p>I permit myself to draw your attention to the fact that our delegation
                        proposed to transform your amendment into a resolution undertaken by the
                        conference which would express the wish that the powers responsible for
                        German economic policy notify as soon as possible either the organization or
                        the provisional committee of the organization of the decisions which they
                        would have taken with respect to this policy. This would give, in substance,
                        satisfaction to the desire expressed by the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>We would be equally in agreement if it was suggested at Habana that German
                        economic policy should be, to the extent possible, in accordance with the
                        provisions of the charter and if it was proposed to amend the articles of
                        the charter concerning the adherence of new members in such a way that
                        Germany or a part thereof could adhere to the organization, it being
                        understood that this adherence could be made only if the candidacy of
                        Germany or a part of Germany was presented with the consent of the
                        responsible occupying powers.</p>
                    <p>These proposals in their entirety would give to the members of the
                        organization the possibility of committing themselves not to employ, once
                        the organization has been established, discriminatory measures in their
                        trade with the occupied zones. The wish which you express in your letter
                        would thus be satisfied.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me therefore that in the light of the above-mentioned
                        considerations we can only maintain the instructions addressed to our
                        delegation in Habana.</p>
                    <p>Since the Department of State has set forth to our Ambassador in Washington
                        its views on the subject raised by your letter, we are asking M. Bonnet<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">The French Ambassador in Washington.</note> to

                    <p>At the Conference now going on in Habana to develop a Charter for an
                        International Trade Organization, the United States Delegation has been
                        attempting to secure most-favored-nation treatment and the other benefits of
                        the Charter for the occupied areas. This attempt has run into very strong
                        opposition from the United Kingdom, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
                        China. The Czechs have indicated that they could not accept a Charter with
                        the occupied areas in it, and the United Kingdom and France have suggested
                        that the problem of the treatment of the occupied areas should be left to a
                        later date, France indicating that the question might appropriately be taken
                        up at the Tripartite discussions in London. The legal competence of the
                        Habana Conference to consider the problem has also been brought into
                        question.</p>
                    <p>I have spoken with Lord Inverchapel and a representative of the French
                        Embassy here, indicating in strong terms the importance of obtaining
                        most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied areas by bringing them within
                        the Charter and urging that their governments support our position at
                        Habana. Our Embassy in Paris has also taken the matter up with the French
                        Foreign Office. Despite these various representations, there has thus far
                        been no change in the British and French position at Habana, It now appears
                        that about the maximum we can get at this time with regard to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter is a commitment to determine the
                        relation of the occupied areas to the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        after it is set up, probably in 1949 or possibly 1950, and a resolution by
                        the Conference to the effect that trade relations between the occupied areas
                        and the other members of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> should be
                        conducted in accordance with the principles of the Charter and that the
                        determination of the relation of the occupied areas to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> shall be made at the first meeting of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>. We may have to settle for something
                        even less than this.</p>
                    <p>There is another way, however, in which we might accomplish our objective of
                        getting m-f-n treatment for the occupied areas. Toward the end of this month
                        the contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
                            (<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>), recently concluded at Geneva,
                        will convene at Habana to consider problems arising out of the Agreement.
                        This Agreement contains provisions regarding most-favored-nation and general
                        nondiscriminatory treatment similar to those already in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter. If these provisions could be
                        applied to the occupied areas, it would substantially accomplish the purpose
                        intended by the original United States proposal at the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Conference, would <pb n="856"
                            xml:id="pg_856" facs="0366"/>help promote the purposes of the European
                        Recovery Program, and would facilitate the reintegration of Germany into the
                        European and world economy.</p>
                    <p>The attached paper, prepared as a preliminary position paper for the
                        forthcoming <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting, contains a
                        proposal for bringing the occupied areas within <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> and obtaining m-f-n treatment for them. If this proposal
                        or something similar is to be put across at the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> meeting and be meaningful, it is essential that the
                        British and French change their present attitude and support our
                        position.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore requested that you take this matter up, either formally or
                        informally as you see fit, with the British and French at the Tripartite
                        discussions in London in an effort to obtain their support for our view.
                        Since the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting will open shortly
                        after the beginning of the Tripartite discussions and will probably be
                        completed within a week or so, it will be necessary for you to take the
                        question up at the earliest opportunity after the opening of the London
                        discussions if your efforts are to be of any avail for the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting.</p>

                        <p>At the current <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Conference in Habana
                            effort is being made to bring the occupied areas into the Charter so
                            that they would have firm assurance of receiving the benefits of the
                            Charter, particularly m-f-n treatment, when the <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                                >ITO</gloss> came into effect. For this purpose the U.S. Delegation
                            at Habana has proposed an amendment to the Charter, similar to the
                            undertaking suggested in sub-paragraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the
                            first recommendation above, which is designed to bring the occupied
                            areas within the Charter.</p>
                        <p>At Habana, however, strong opposition to the U.S. amendment has
                            developed, particularly from the U.K., France, Czechoslovakia, Poland,
                            and China. The Czechs have indicated that they could not accept a
                            Charter with the occupied areas in it, and the U.K. and <pb n="858"
                                xml:id="pg_858" facs="0368"/>France have suggested that the problem
                            of the treatment of the occupied areas should be left to a later date.
                            The legal competence of the Habana Conference to consider the problem
                            has also been brought into question.</p>
                        <p>The likely outcome of these discussions at Habana is not yet clear, and
                            any conclusions reached now can only be tentative and subject to
                            modification in the light of the results of the Habana deliberations.
                            Mr. Clayton has indicated that if the present opposition to the U.S.
                            amendment for the occupied areas continues, the amendment would be
                            withdrawn and, instead, an effort would be made to obtain at the
                            forthcoming <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting acceptance of
                            a commitment along the lines of recommendation 1 above. Even if the U.S.
                            Delegation is successful in pushing through its amendment at Habana, it
                            would be desirable to obtain a similar commitment at the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting so that the occupied areas
                            could be assured of m-f-n treatment at the present time rather than
                            several years hence when the Charter becomes effective.</p>
                        <p>Sub-paragraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of recommendation 1 suggests
                            that the protocol or commitment should be voluntary and open-end in
                            character. The reason for this suggestion is to afford a procedure
                            whereby such countries as Czechoslovakia and possibly China, which are
                            strongly opposed to any m-f-n commitment for the occupied areas, to stay
                            in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and abstain from such a
                            commitment while other <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries
                            accept such a commitment for themselves. The open-end nature of the
                            proposed commitment would enable the occupied areas to obtain from
                            countries not party to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> a similar
                            commitment for m-f-n and general nondiscriminatory treatment. Though the
                            commitment may have to be worded differently for such non-<gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries, an effort should be made
                            to obtain their consent to applying to the occupied areas as much as
                            possible of the general provisions of Article I and Part II of <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that when a commitment for the extension of the benefits
                            of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to the occupied areas is
                            proposed at Habana, some countries may raise the question of tariff
                            concessions from these areas. At present no effective tariff is being
                            maintained in these areas, and it may be some time due to the prevailing
                            abnormal circumstances before tariff negotiations for these areas could
                            be undertaken. Subject to this qualification, however, the U.S. as an
                            occupying power would not be averse to undertaking such negotiations for
                            its zone at the earliest opportunity.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Win</hi>: I have received your memoranda of
                        telephone conversations, dated January 29, with Percival, of the British
                        Embassy, and Castan, of the French Embassy.<note n="1" xml:id="d153fn1"
                            >Neither printed, but see telegram 132 to Habana, January 30, 1948, <ref
                                target="#pg_838">p. 838</ref>, for a summary.</note> I have not told
                        the Delegations here flatly that it would be absolutely impossible for the
                        Administration to present the Charter to Congress this year. I am sorry that
                        this information had to come to them in a round-about way.</p>
                    <p>I had hoped that the Charter might be presented to Congress in such a way
                        that it would go before a committee that would give it a fair hearing and
                        consider its merits and demerits, advantages and disadvantages, in a calm
                        atmosphere, with the emphasis on its foreign policy aspects and its general
                        significance for international economic cooperation. In short, I had hoped
                        that the Charter would go to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate
                        on its merits.</p>
                    <p>The inevitable consequence of the decision to drop the Charter and push for
                        the renewal of the Trade Agreements Act, it seems to me, will be this:—your
                        discussion of the Trade Agreements renewal will drive you into a discussion
                        of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>; consideration of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> will drive you into a cross-examination
                        on the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter. The Charter will thus be
                        dragged in by the heels, without any opportunity for a favorable or friendly
                        presentation. The Geneva and Havana drafts will have their first
                        Congressional consideration before the most hostile and violently prejudiced
                        forum in either house of Congress, the Committee on Ways and Means. The
                        result will be that the Charter will be politically discredited before any
                        opportunity is provided to give it a fair hearing. The only way I can think
                        of to avoid this is formally to present the Charter to the Senate as soon as
                        the Havana Conference closes. Can you think of any other way?</p>

                        re occupied areas. Determined resistance has centered around UK which sought
                        primarily to block any action whatever at Havana re occupied areas and,
                        failing this, to confine action to weak recommendation for study by govts.

                        lead pending London discussion. Slavic states have used obstructive tactics.

                    <p>199. For Lovett from Clayton reourtel 196. At informal meeting today with UK,
                        France, Czech, Scandinavians, Belgium, Holland, Australia, New Zealand,
                        South Africa, Canada, US presented proposal for resolution Havana Conference
                        recommending acceptance by all governments concerned of draft agreement on
                            <gloss target="#t_mfn1">MFN</gloss> treatment foreign trade occupied
                        areas. Agreement would bind signatory governments whether as occupying
                        authorities or as governments of states trading with occupied areas to apply
                            <gloss target="#t_mfn1">MFN</gloss> treatment to such trade.</p>
                    <p>Reaction extremely negative. UK offered counter proposal for resolution of
                        delegates willing sign at Havana recommending to governments concerned same
                        agreement but in weakened form for study with a view to its being brought
                        into effect “at an early date”.</p>
                    <p>Czech stated it would be politically impossible accord <gloss
                            target="#t_mfn1">MFN</gloss> treatment German goods in any manner which
                        would become known to Czech population. Australia made similar statement
                        regarding Jap <pb n="861" xml:id="pg_861" facs="0371"/>goods. No support for
                        US proposal Scandinavian and low country delegates remaining silent.</p>
                    <p>As result reception our proposal I withdrew US amendment to article 99 of
                        charter and US proposal for separate agreement. Amendment to article 68
                        enabling <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> to deal with issue agreed.</p>
                    <p>Reaction our proposal probably indicative of strong attitude on part
                        considerable number countries against goods occupied areas and possibility
                        of unofficial boycott. Result fortifies me in belief expressed in <gloss
                            target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 196 that only prompt and effective
                        way attack problem vis-à-vis western European countries will be through
                        insertion provision in relief legislation. [Clayton.]</p>

                    <p>226. For Clayton from Lovett. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved

                        themselves. You may advise <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> countries
                        that we would expect clause such as you suggest ur 196 Feb 15 in bilatetal

                        <p>A situation has arisen at Habana which causes my Government great
                            concern. The United States Delegation has proposed an amendment to the
                            draft Charter for an International Trade Organization which would
                            provide that members, in their administration of the Western zones of
                            Germany and of Japan, should be subject to the obligations and entitled
                            to the benefits of the Charter. One of the most important of these
                            benefits is that of most-favored-nation treatment in tariffs and other
                            trade regulations. The United Kingdom Delegation has opposed this
                            amendment on the ground that this is not the appropriate time to discuss
                            this question.</p>
                        <p>My Government believes (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that it is of the
                            utmost importance that Germany be integrated into the economy of Western
                            Europe as rapidly and effectively as possible; (<hi rend="italic"
                            >b</hi>) that it would be contrary to the interests of all of the
                            occupying powers if any member of the International Trade Organization
                            should be free to discriminate against the trade of these occupied
                            zones; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that it will be most difficult for
                            the Congress and people of the United States to understand why the
                            Government of the United Kingdom would be unwilling at this time to
                            undertake a commitment to extend most-favored-nation treatment and the
                            other benefits of the Charter to these occupied areas, particularly in
                            view of the fact that the United States is contemplating an extensive
                            program of aid to Western Europe designed to assist it in a program of
                            self-help.</p>
                        <p>On January 23, officers of the Department spoke with a representative of
                            the British Embassy asking him to impress upon his Government the
                            importance which my Government attached to its amendment. We have
                            received a reply that the United Kingdom Government is unable to concur
                            in the amendment, but no reasons for this position were given except
                            that it was considered to be premature.<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4">In

                        <p>I would like to reiterate again the fact that my Government considers it
                            absolutely essential that there be agreement at Habana on some form of
                            undertaking that the members of the International Trade Organization
                            will give most-favored-nation treatment to the products of the Western
                            zones of Germany and Japan in return for most-favored-nation treatment
                            of their products by the authorities occupying those zones. My
                            Government would prefer to see this recognition take the form of
                            acceptance of the amendment to Article 99 of the draft Charter which it
                            has proposed, but would, of course, be willing to consider alternative
                            suggestions along this line.</p>
                        <p>This question is being debated today at Habana, and a prompt decision is
                            imperative. I hope you will emphasize this to your Government. I hardly
                            need mention how unfortunate it would be if the public should gain the
                            impression that our two Governments were at odds on so important a
                            question of economic policy with respect to the zones in Germany which
                            we respectively administer.</p>

                    <p>Preliminary examination of the communication which they had received this
                        morning from HMG’s delegation indicated that while on the one hand further
                        concessions were contemplated for the South American countries, India,
                        Australia and New Zealand in the establishment of quotas and restrictions to
                        trade in order to foster economic development, on the other hand, HMG was
                        being asked to relinquish some of the concessions of a discriminatory
                        character to which we had tentatively agreed at Geneva.<note n="1"

                        Compromises with undeveloped countries and strategy in negotiation have
                        worked out in full consultation with UK, Commonwealth, and European
                        delegations under Clayton’s direction February 13 through 19. British
                        delegation has not dissented from decisions made in this group but has
                        subsequently sought delays in negotiations.</p>
                    <p>US delegation defended Geneva draft Article 23 exceptions to rule of
                        non-discrimination during first months of conference. British delegation
                        sought amendments providing greater freedom for discrimination than Geneva
                        draft and supported numerous European amendments having same effect. Final

                            >ITO</gloss> approval. Further concession would destroy long run hope
                        for multilateral trade and render charter indefensible in US. Draft
                        subsequently accepted by French, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
                        Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and
                        favorably received by other delegations. Would be impossible obtain as wide
                        support at Havana for any other draft that could be accepted in US.</p>

                        today with Alphand Saltzman and Martin outlined alternative courses of
                        action now being considered by us with respect to most-favored-nation
                        treatment for occupied areas. In view shortness of time proceeded
                        immediately to describe (1) provision for most-favored-nation treatment in
                        bilateral agreements under <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss>, (2) protocol
                        which would commit occupying powers on one hand and other signatories to the
                        protocol to apply provisions of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to
                        occupied areas on reciprocal basis, and (3) protocol on same open-end basis
                        merely committing signatories to apply most-favored-nation treatment to
                        their trade with the occupied areas if they receive similar treatment from
                        the occupied areas. Three exceptions for occupying powers listed in
                        Clayton–Douglas memorandum were suggested as well as possible need for
                        security exception similar to Article 94 for other signatories.</p>
                    <p>(2) Importance US attaches to recognition of principles involved was
                        stressed.</p>
                    <p>(3) In answer to question indicated inability to say that if protocol adopted
                        would not proceed with provision in bilateral agreements.</p>
                    <p>(4) Alphand expressed general French agreement with US objective as regards
                        opening channels for German exports. Only real question was to what kind of
                        Germany most-favored-nation treatment was to be granted. When usual French
                        security fears had been allayed, there would be no problem, but until

                        suggested that in view this problem commitment clearly limited to occupation
                        period would be materially less objectionable than one applicable to
                        post-occupation period.</p>

                        “for the time being.” Reasons apparently political. This would rule out, he

                                    <item>On (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), the difficulty is that the
                                        provisions concerned are obscure and ambiguous and, above
                                        all, that they may involve acceptance of an obligation which
                                        we may not be able to fulfill with consequential dangers of
                                        misunderstandings, accusations of bad faith, political and
                                        other implications, etc. Given sufficient time, these
                                        obscurities and difficulties could, no doubt, be removed,
                                        particularly if the discussion could take place in an
                                        atmosphere totally different from that ruling in Havana
                                        (preferably in Washington where the practical implications
                                        of the Section Nine complications can be more readily
                                            assessed).<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">Section 9 of the
                                            Anglo-American Financial Agreement of December 1945,
                                            entitled “Import Arrangements”, provided that “If either
                                            the Government of the United States or the Government of
                                            the United Kingdom imposes or maintains quantitative
                                            import restrictions, such restrictions shall be
                                            administered on a basis which does not discriminate

                                            effect in 1946–1948 of freeing U.S. trade from British
                                            discriminatory restrictions but at the same time of
                                            making more difficult Britain’s export and foreign

                                worked out. The main difficulties are its possible ambiguity and its
                                grudging acknowledgment of the possibility of discriminatory
                                imports. The draft provides no clear-cut way out of the Section Nine
                                problem since its provisions are not capable of being substituted
                                for the existing Section Nine provisions. One main difficulty is
                                that the non-discrimination provisions are [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >as</hi>] now drafted appear to cover satisfactorily all
                                countries except the United Kingdom. This is because in effect they
                                permit the continuation and modification of discriminatory
                                arrangements in force on 15th February, 1948, when we alone were
                                bound by the non-discrimination provisions of Section Nine. Apart
                                from other objections to further attempts to settle this complex
                                issue in the atmosphere of Havana, it is unthinkable that the
                                conference could be prolonged to give time for a satisfactory
                                settlement of very special and difficult problem, complicated as it
                                is by the existence of the Section Nine difficulty.</p>

                            <p>The general principle of prior approval for use of quantitative
                                restrictions has been maintained in form, but only subject to
                                serious loophole that quantitative restrictions which meet certain
                                objective (but, in reality, largely subjective) criteria qualify
                                automatically for <pb n="871" xml:id="pg_871" facs="0381"/>such
                                prior approval thus removing in those cases even the relative
                                safeguard of subsequent disapproval by the organization. It is
                                symptomatic of the subjective nature of these criteria that in
                                certain cases measures which are merely “designed” for particular
                                purposes (as distinct from being “necessary” for those purposes)
                                must be automatically approved by the organization without any
                                provision for subsequent complaint.</p>
                            <p>The detailed provisions are extremely complicated but there is no
                                doubt that they involve a very substantial breach in the provision
                                of the charter to which we attach major importance i.e. that
                                protective quotas should not be applied without the prior approval
                                of the organization on their individual merits.</p>

                            <p>Here again the principle of prior approval for any new preferences
                                has been maintained in form but in practice new preferences which
                                are claimed to be necessary for developmental purposes qualify for
                                approval on a number of loose “automatic” criteria provided that
                                they are between territories which are geographically contiguous or
                                form part of one “economic region”. In other words regional
                                preferences may be instituted without close control or even
                                subsequent check, whilst new preferences with e.g. the Commonwealth
                                would require approval by two-thirds of the members of the
                                organization. On merits, arrangements of this kind might be
                                extremely damaging to our export interests (e.g. in South
                                American—cotton preferences in neighbouring countries to be enjoyed
                                by Brazil) and politically any such arrangements which put our own
                                preferential system at a distinct disadvantage are obviously most
                                vulnerable to severe criticism, however unlikely the contingencies
                                envisaged might be in practice.”</p>

                        interpretations can be clarified and should be no insurmountable
                        obstacle.</p>
                    <p>As to protective quantitative restrictions for development purposes, it is
                        Cripps’ view that the language drafted at Havana in effect releases all of
                        the less well developed countries from the provisions of the charter, for it
                        enables them by unilateral action to impose such restrictions as they may
                        themselves deem necessary as “designed” to achieve certain purposes, without
                        in advance receiving the approval of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        organization, or indeed afterwards obtaining its sanction.</p>
                    <p>As to new preferences, it is Cripps’ view that the language presently being
                        drafted at Havana discriminates against the UK and Commonwealth on the sole
                        grounds that the members of the Commonwealth and the Crown colonies are not
                        contiguous. This he suggests can be <pb n="872" xml:id="pg_872" facs="0382"
                        />cured by extending to the UK, Commonwealth and the colonial colonies the
                        same rights to establish new preferences which are contemplated under the
                        present draft of the charter. (I would point out, however, as I did to
                        Cripps, that if this were done, it would have the effect of voiding, at
                        least in part, the agreement previously made with the British in regard to
                        Empire preferences.)</p>
                    <p>Cripps says that in its present form it would be politically impossible to
                        present the charter to parliament. I suggest that it might be desirable to
                        invite HMG to send a strong man to Washington to reconcile the divergent
                        views, and subsequently, if time permits, to proceed to Havana to present
                        the British view to the conference, after having settled the difficulties in
                        Washington. If this is not possible, or for some reason is considered
                        inadvisable, and if difficulties are not resolved prior to March 10 when I
                        understand the Havana conference now plans to adjourn, then Cripps suggests
                        that the Havana conference be adjourned without taking final action of [<hi
                            rend="italic">on</hi>] the charter, and be reconvened in two or three
                        months time for the purpose of settling the problems which Cripps
                        raises.</p>
                    <p>The only other course which Cripps informs me his government can take is to
                        refuse to sign the charter. This he is very reluctant to do, because of the
                        significance of multilateral trade to the UK, and indeed to the whole world,
                        but he informs me that there would be no other course for him to take if the
                        alternatives suggested above are not acceptable.</p>
                    <p>I am not repeating this to Havana, since I understand Clayton is now in
                        Washington.</p>

                        meetings with all of the British and European countries here in an effort to
                        bring the Conference to a conclusion. Two weeks ago all of these people
                        (except Eric Colban<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Erik Colban, Head of the
                            Norwegian Delegation.</note>) were buried in gloom. Wilgress saw no hope
                        at all. Coombs was saying that <pb n="873" xml:id="pg_873" facs="0383"/>we
                        should adjourn the Conference and put the whole project on ice for a year or
                        more. I called a meeting and talked to these people like a football coach
                        talks with his team before the last game of the season and then, at a series
                        of subsequent meetings, developed a party line for the solution of all
                        outstanding issues. At this stage, fortunately, Will Clayton joined me for a
                        week, and by working tirelessly day and night we brought the most serious
                        problems to a point where it appeared certain that the Conference was going
                        to succeed. We receded from our impossible position on occupied areas, we
                        got a draft on relations with non-Members which was acceptable to the Czechs
                        and the Scandinavians, we got a solution on non-discrimination which was
                        acceptable to all of the Europeans and to the British Delegation here (if
                        not to their Government in London), and we got the Latins and the other
                        undeveloped countries into an apparent mood of compromise in a series of
                        meetings in which we presented them with a new draft of Article 13. It thus
                        appeared that every serious obstacle to the conclusion of our work was
                        removed.</p>
                    <p>These last two weeks have involved incessant toil, and have been exhausting
                        in the extreme. We had to work out all these positions, first in the U.S.
                        Delegation, second with the British and European countries, and third, in
                        negotiations with the undeveloped countries. In addition to that, we have
                        had a protracted and annoying struggle with the French on the subject of
                        appeals to the International Court of Justice under Chapter VIII, and a
                        delicate and interminable negotiation with the Arabs, the Czechs, the
                        Indians, and the South Africans over the question of political boycotts. For
                        three months we have kept this one out of the newspapers. If it ever hit the
                        headlines the repercussions might be extremely serious. Holloway is still
                        waiting for word from Smuts, and we may still have troubles here.<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>In the week since Clayton left, working continuously with the British and
                        European countries, I have brought all of the remaining issues with the
                        undeveloped countries together into a single package. The contents of the
                        package are (1) our new draft of Article 13, (2) our final position on
                        Article 15, (3) three alternative approaches to the problems presented by
                        the Tariff Committee and the Economic Development Committee, (4) the final
                        settlement of the question of the Executive Board, and (5) removal of
                        outstanding amendments and reservations relating to all of these points. At
                        a meeting of the Coordinating Committee (nine undeveloped countries, three
                        devastated countries, and Wilcox) yesterday morning I presented and
                        explained all of these documents and indicated quite clearly that they <pb
                            n="874" xml:id="pg_874" facs="0384"/>represented our final position and
                        had to be taken in their entirety. The Committee meets again this afternoon
                        to get the reaction of the undeveloped countries. It is our belief that we
                        have satisfied China, India, the Arab countries, and the Central Americans,
                        and that we can get a majority any time we force the question to a vote. We
                        should be very much surprised if the other Latinos would turn us down
                        flatly. It is perhaps too much to hope that they will accept the package as
                        is. What is more probable is an effort to go on chiseling away at point
                        after point, and we all feel certain that now, after three months of
                        persuasion and compromise, the time has come when we must say No and
                        continue to say No. At the earliest possible moment I hope to carry our
                        package to a meeting of all Heads of Delegations and force a final
                        showdown.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Clayton left at the end of last week I had some hope that we should
                        be able to complete Committee work by the end of February and get out of
                        Havana by the end of the first week in March. Two days ago, however, the
                        Secretariat put out a paper which established two weeks as the time required
                        between the completion of Committee work and the signature of the Final Act.
                        This made March 14 the target date for the conclusion of the Conference. Now
                        everybody is convinced that the Committee work will not be completed by the
                        end of this month and the prospect, therefore, is that this business may
                        drag on to the 20th or the 25th.</p>

                        He asks whether UK delegation should move to adjourn conference or refuse to

                    <p>Believe it unnecessary to yield to British pressure on any point. All other

                        Asiatics. If UK does not come along will be isolated in conference.

                    <p>249. For Clayton from Wilcox. Will have complete agreement on all outstanding
                        issues within next 3 or 4 days. On basis present understandings final act
                        will be signed by some fifty countries excepting Swiss, probably Argentina,
                        possibly one or two other Latins. UK now making desperate last minute
                        attempt to extract additional concessions or prevent successful conclusion
                        of negotiations. Comments on points raised London’s 726 February 25

                    <p>Draft Article 23 on non-discrimination which has been agreed unanimously in
                        working party and has now been formally circulated here for action by
                        sub-committee was negotiated by Clayton with British and French February 18
                        and 19. Subsequently considerable number of drafting changes were agreed
                        upon principally to provide clarifications requested by British delegation.
                        London’s statement that main difficulty involves 15 February 1948 basis for
                        transitional discrimination is incomprehensible here. London evidently
                        seriously misconstrues text. Present text permits British for transition
                        period all of discrimination permissible under London draft Charter, plus
                        all of discrimination permissible under Geneva draft Charter, plus any
                        additional discriminations existing on 15 February 1948, plus adaptations
                        thereof. This has been made entirely clear in draft worked out with full
                        collaboration and approval by British delegation. Having reached complete
                        agreement on article with all Europeans and Commonwealths and with no
                        dissent from any other delegation which has seen text, it is inconceivable
                        that we should ask fifty countries assembled here to await a new bilateral
                        negotiation between US and UK on Section 9. For ten weeks here we stood
                        firmly for Geneva <pb n="876" xml:id="pg_876" facs="0386"/>draft against
                        combined attacks by many Europeans including British. Finally we brought
                        forward new draft on basis of which Clayton quickly negotiated agreement
                        with British, Europeans, and Commonwealths. Could not undo this solution now
                        without returning conference to impasse in which it languished for
                        months.</p>

                    <p>Cripps’ objection here is to compromise drafted by delegates of US, UK,
                        France, Austria cleared with all countries of Commonwealth and Western
                        Europe, negotiated by Clayton with Latin Americans, and accepted by all
                        other undeveloped countries. Is true that draft is inconsistent in principle
                        with Washington proposals. But not inconsistent with compromise Charter
                        texts adopted in London and Geneva with active participation and agreement
                        UK delegates.</p>
                    <p>Statements that present draft involves “substantial breach” or “serious
                        loophole”; that it “releases all of the less well developed countries from
                        provisions of Charter”; that it enables them to impose restrictions
                        unilaterally without receiving advance approval; that it gives <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> no subsequent control, are all untrue.</p>
                    <p>Fact is all products covered by trade agreements remain under tight control.
                        Provisions in question, therefore, relate only to minor part of trade not
                        covered in agreements. Here prior approval required in all cases. But given
                        automatically in two limited cases: (1) Industries first established during
                        war, and (2) industries whose markets have been taken away by new or
                        increased restrictions imposed abroad. But even here <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> can fix any time limit it chooses on use of <gloss
                            target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss> and any renewal must be sought under tighter
                        provisions satisfying numerous and difficult criteria.</p>
                    <p>Present draft of Article 13 is the one crucial compromise which will enable
                        us to obtain almost complete agreement between developed and undeveloped
                        countries here. This may be reason Cripps has singled it out for attack.
                        Draft is acceptable to all other industrial countries.</p>

                    <p>London’s 2(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), 3(1), and 4(<hi rend="italic"
                        >c</hi>).</p>
                    <p>Present draft of Article 15 is inconsistent with original Washington
                        proposals. So were earlier drafts of same article which UK delegates
                        accepted in London and Geneva. Present text drafted in full collaboration
                        with UK delegate is designed to secure adherence of Arab states and Central
                        American Republics whose trade, among themselves, has no great economic
                        significance; is accepted for this purpose by all other industrial
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Statements that criteria are “loose”; that release is purely “automatic”;
                        that arrangements are not subject to “close control”, are all <pb n="877"
                            xml:id="pg_877" facs="0387"/>untrue. Opinion here is that present draft
                        is much tighter than London–Geneva drafts since we would certainly have been
                        defeated on requirement in brackets for two-thirds vote.</p>
                    <p>Under draft, <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> must judge whether
                        arrangement “necessary” to establish “sound and adequate” markets for new
                        industries for each participant in new preferential arrangement. Can order
                        applicants to negotiate with any member who would be injured by arrangement.
                        Holds participants to <gloss target="#t_mfn1">MFN</gloss> rates bound in
                        trade agreements unless released by other parties to agreements. Binds
                        preferential margin. Forbids departure from details of proposed
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>UK is not really objecting to above provisions. But is complaining that
                        definition drawn to meet cases of Arabs and Central Americans will not let
                        UK set up new preferences with colonies by majority vote in <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>, but would require two-thirds vote. Holmes
                        presented this case yesterday at meeting US delegation office with all
                        Commonwealth and Europe. Australia and New Zealand flatly rejected UK
                        position. Canada and South Africa remained silent. Europeans just
                        smiled.</p>
                    <p>Argument that article would be unjust to UK completely untenable. Charter
                        permits British Commonwealth to retain preferential system vitally affecting
                        major part of world trade without prior <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        approval. Forbids Arabs and Central Americans to establish preferences with
                        insignificant effects on world trade without prior <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> approval.</p>
                    <p>In connection with (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                        above, it should be noted that all Latin Americans and other undeveloped
                        countries complain that Charter has been heavily slanted towards interests
                        of UK, against interests of undeveloped areas, since it leaves former free
                        to use <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss> and preferences and requires latter
                        to get <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> permission to use them. In
                        connection with (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) above, it should be noted also
                        that Western Europeans, particularly Belgians and Dutch, complain that U.S.
                        invariably sacrifices their interests whenever UK insists. In going along
                        with UK on discrimination issue, we nearly lost Belgian and Dutch support
                        for whole Charter. We could not now yield to British pressure without
                        alienating most countries in world.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Cripps suggests adjournment Habana Conference for 2 or 3 months either to
                        enable London to inform itself on developments fully known to UK delegation
                        here or to enable London to attempt to extract from Washington some
                        concessions beyond those sought by UK delegation here.…</p>
                    <p>When I suggested adjournment as one possible course of action 2 months ago,
                        Washington instructed me to press negotiations until satisfactory Charter
                        approved by majority of countries here. Adjournment <pb n="878"
                            xml:id="pg_878" facs="0388"/>might have been possible then. It is
                        impossible now. Fifty countries are ready to sign the final act of this
                        conference within the next few days.</p>
                    <p>If conference is not adjourned, Cripps threatens UK will not “sign the
                        Charter”. Of course nobody will “sign the Charter” at Habana. Delegates will
                        merely sign final act of conference authenticating text. Governments will
                        not be bound until parliaments ratify. Cripps probably means UK would not
                        sign final act. Cannot believe he would … carry out this threat.</p>
                    <p>UK Government has been publicly committed as full partner of US in this
                        project from Atlantic Charter in 1941 and Lend-Lease Article VII in 1942,
                        through A–A loan agreement and jointly sponsored proposals in 1945, London
                        Conference 1946, Geneva Conference 1947, and in 16-Nation report on <gloss
                            target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> last fall. Agreement now within reach here
                        essential to support Bretton Woods agreements and widely heralded as
                        necessary aftermath of <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss>. In scope,
                        variety, detail, importance, will surpass anything in previous history of
                        international economic relations. Conference will be universally acclaimed
                        as first important one to be brought to highly successful conclusion since
                        San Francisco and Bretton Woods. It is incredible that UK, with no support
                        from anyone, would assume the responsibility of attempting to scuttle it at
                        the eleventh hour.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment, the present Government of the UK, while giving lip service to
                        the principles of multilateral trade, really believes that Britain can never
                        face free competition and must seek sheltered markets through preferential
                        arrangements, discriminatory bilateral contracts, and barter deals. For that
                        reason, it has never wanted the Charter to be adopted or the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> to be set up. The UK delegates have not
                        given the US delegation whole-hearted or effective support at London,
                        Geneva, or Havana. The UK has apparently assumed that agreement, among so
                        many countries, on so many vital issues, could not be obtained. Now that it
                        is in hand they are seeking to destroy it. Fortunately they are too
                        late.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that Cripps threatened to walk out on the Geneva negotiations
                        last summer unless we would give British complete freedom to discriminate
                        for a year. We capitulated. Subsequently he refused flatly to carry out the
                        commitment of his government to negotiate in good faith for the elimination
                        of preferences. We capitulated again. Now he is employing the same tactics.
                        But the situation is radically different. Everything is out in the open. He
                        cannot get his way in secret. He is completely isolated—from the rest of the
                        Commonwealth, from the countries of Europe, from all the undeveloped
                        countries of the world. We do not have to give him anything. The UK will not
                        move to adjourn the conference. It will sign the final act.</p>
                    <pb n="879" xml:id="pg_879" facs="0389"/>
                    <p>At this late hour it is undesirable and indeed impossible to transfer these
                        negotiations to London or Washington. It must be remembered that this
                        conference has been going on for more than three months and 56 other
                        delegations are involved. If Cripps or Harold Wilson would fly to Havana,
                        Clayton might meet him here. But he could scarcely get here in time to
                        influence the final agreement in any way.</p>
                    <p>It would appear that only thing we can do under circumstances is explicitly
                        to refute each of the British arguments under paragraph (<hi rend="italic"
                            >a</hi>) above, flatly to reject the proposal that conference be
                        adjourned, and emphatically to demonstrate it is impossible for Cripps to
                        carry out his threat not to sign final act. This should be done soonest. The
                        Havana streamroller cannot be stopped.</p>

                        the British Empire should be able to be treated as a region and we

                    <p>Embassy feels British insistence revision Article 23 involves two political
                        risks for US: (1) Risk of trying simplify text at present stage of

                        Congress in accepting simple categorical statement of exceptions to
                        non-discrimination rule as against more involved statement, particularly
                        with trade agreement program coming up.</p>

                            cannot be considered. It would permit unlimited introduction and
                            expansion of discrimination during transition period. We do not feel we
                            could even submit such a provision to Congress let alone defend it. New
                            Article 23 consistently with 1945 Anglo American proposals, parallels
                            Fund transition period arrangement closely. It expands latitude for
                            discrimination by two additional alternative texts in paragraph 1(<hi

                            three bases can be used interchangeably in practice without need to
                            define boundaries of each in advance. Without question, Havana text
                            offers wider range of transitional discrimination than Washington
                            proposals, London text, or Geneva text. Astonished at statement “Havana
                            discussions indicate <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> will interpret
                            narrowly”. Whole question of narrowness of Fund interpretations raised
                            here was political attempt by French to extract some endorsement of
                            their defiance of Fund on franc devaluation matter. How British can now
                            adopt French position after spearheading Fund’s action on franc question
                            is incomprehensible. Matter has no relevance to question of Article 23.
                            On question section nine, we cannot see how new text of 23 would make
                            any proposed section nine negotiations more difficult than either Geneva
                            or London texts of same article.</item>

                                >c</hi>) of Article 23: “provided that if a member was limited on
                            the 15th February 1948 in such deviation by reason of any agreement with
                            another country, such member shall, for the purposes of this paragraph,
                            be entitled to do anything which, [but] for such limitation, could have
                            done on that date”. This was drafted by Cripps personally in early hours
                            of morning. He indicated that if this additional concession to protect
                            British position were made he would accept balance Article 23 in present
                            draft, since he recognizes US political difficulties especially if
                            Article 23 were to be redrafted at this stage of conference.</item>

                    <p>760. For Douglas from Clayton (For delivery before 9 a.m.) Dept and <gloss
                            target="#t_UsDel1">USDel</gloss> consider proviso suggested by Cripps
                            (<gloss target="#t_urtel1">urtel</gloss> 860 Mar 4) wholly
                        unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>If limiting agreement referred to in proviso is interpreted to apply only to
                        Anglo-U.S. financial agreement, the proviso would give British wider freedom
                        to discriminate than any other country since other countries would be
                        confined to continuance or adaptation of restrictions in force on Feb 15,
                        1948, but British would not be limited in any way. Para B would be nullified
                        so far as they are concerned. Our agreement to any such provision would be
                        regarded as a complete sellout by other countries at Habana, particularly
                        Belgians, Dutch and Latin Americans. Any discrimination against British
                        under present draft is more apparent than real, as under Article 14 of Fund
                        Agreement they could do practically anything they could legitimately desire.
                        Moreover, in any case where conditions on a base date are made the test,
                        there is bound to be a difference in the treatment of different
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>If limiting agreement referred to in proviso is interpreted to apply to any
                        agreements providing for most-favored-nation treatment, such as U.S. trade
                        agreements and commercial treaties, the exoneration would be so widespread
                        as practically to render Art 23 meaningless.</p>
                    <p>The proviso could be used as a lever by British to nullify Section 9 of the
                        Anglo-U.S. financial agreement. This is a matter which should be handled in
                        separate U.S.–UK negotiations, and collateral attack on the agreement
                        through Charter is unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>Resolution this question urgent as atmosphere Habana cordial and all points

                        representations re seriousness of situation. Apparently Wilson had rough
                        time with Cabinet committee and must have some improvement with which to
                        face full Cabinet on Monday. Sorest point is Article 15 and preferences
                        which British agree is not US fault and US assistance much appreciated but
                        this is in effect knife-edge on which Cabinet acceptance of charter is
                        balanced. Wilson feels that if he has to overcome added difficulty of
                        confusion over Article 23 it may be too much. What he needs is clear
                        acceptable text Article 23 and time through Monday if he is going to put it

                                >USDel</gloss> draft based on Embassy’s March 5 agreement with
                            President <gloss target="#t_BOT1">BOT</gloss> follows: Under proposal,
                            country can elect either Habana or Geneva rules for its transition
                            period. Under either option length of a country’s transition period
                            would be determined by <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Period in
                            controversy relates only to possible time between March 1952 and end of
                            a country’s transition period. During this interval, scope of
                            permissible discrimination under Habana option would be determined by
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, CEM [<hi rend="italic"
                            >sic</hi>] and scope under Geneva option would be determined by <gloss
                                target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>. British delegation calls this “dual
                            control” by <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>, and claims British Government will not
                            accept it. Asks instead removal of all control over scope of
                            discrimination from Geneva option. This would give country electing
                            Geneva option far greater latitude for discrimination than countries
                            electing Habana option and would be completely unacceptable to
                            continental countries and indefensible in US. Is important that two
                            options be evenly balanced.</item>

                        <item>Only reasonable point in British criticism was following: <gloss

                            from March 1952 to end of transition period under Habana option involved

                            purpose in this period under Geneva option involved prior approval.

                            approval and accept post-examination completely paralleling procedure

                            this proposal as final extreme concession to British position solely to

                            UK purpose may be to use supposed desire of US to complete conference

                            Section 9 of loan agreement. UK points out loan agreement referred to
                            future multilateral agreement and contends text accepted here would
                            supersede provisions Section 9.</item>

                    <p>Re section 9 during film negotiations<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">In order to
                            conserve dollars the British Government, on August 6, 1947, imposed a
                            300% <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty on imported films. The
                            valuation method resulted in a 75% tax on net earnings which would have
                            otherwise been remitted abroad. American film makers were most
                            concerned. On March 11, 1948, representatives: of the United States
                            motion picture industry negotiated an agreement with the British
                            Government which provided that the former rates of duty were to be
                            restored; that $17 million of earnings per year for U.S. film showings
                            would be remitted for two years; and that sterling uses of revenues in
                            excess of remitted amounts would be permitted. The four year agreement
                            was to be reviewed after 2 years, at which time conditions were to be
                            set for the remaining two years.</note> I mentioned it in that
                        connection and Wilson who had just come from Cabinet meeting on Charter said
                        “don’t talk to me of section 9” from which infer that Cabinet gave him rough
                        time on that question. Nevertheless Wilson and <gloss target="#t_BOT1"
                            >BOT</gloss> have not mentioned it since Cripps’ proposal was turned

                    <p>Mr. Percival came in to discuss Article 23 of the Charter dealing with
                        discrimination for balance of payments reasons and in this connection
                        presented a letter from the British Ambassador<note n="1" xml:id="d182fn1"
                            >Lord Inverchapel.</note> addressed to the Secretary of State.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The letter was concerned with two points: (1) the presumed dual control by
                        both the Fund and the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> over
                        discrimination under the Geneva rules to be incorporated into the new
                        Article 23 in contrast to only single control by the Fund under the Habana
                        draft of these provisions, and (2) a request for postponement for several
                        days of any decision by the Habana Conference on these provisions so as to
                        afford the British Cabinet time to consider the problem. On the latter point
                        Mr. Brown, on the basis of information received from Mr. Wilcox at Habana,
                        assured Mr. Percival that a decision could be postponed until next Tuesday,
                        thus meeting the British request. Mr. Percival expressed his appreciation
                        for the postponement. Mr. Brown emphasized the urgency of settling the
                        problem as soon as possible and coming to a decision on next Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the question of dual control, it was pointed out to Mr.
                        Percival that in the case of both the Geneva and Habana rules incorporated
                        in the new Article 23 the International Monetary Fund would be responsible
                        for determining the end of the transition period and thus both sets of rules
                        were on an equal level in this respect. During the transition period the
                        Fund would be responsible for determining the permissible degree of
                        discrimination under the Habana rules, whereas the <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> would be responsible for determining the latitude of
                        discrimination under the Geneva rules. Under both sets of rules only one
                        body would be responsible for determining the degree of discrimination and
                        hence they were on an equal level in this respect also. <pb n="893"

                        interpretation of the Habana and Geneva texts on discrimination for balance
                        of payments reasons and indicated that he would pass this interpretation on
                        to his Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Percival suggested, however, that the British considered dual control to
                        exist under the Geneva rules in the sense that both the Fund and the
                        Organization were given powers which affected a Member’s ability to
                        discriminate, the Fund by being able to terminate the transition period and
                        the Organization by determining the degree of discrimination within the
                        transition period. This contrasted with the Habana rules under which only
                        one body, the Fund, had any responsibility regarding the determination of
                        both the scope and the duration of discrimination. It was pointed out in
                        reply, however, that our Delegation at Habana considered only single control
                        to exist even under the Geneva rules in the sense that only one body, the
                        Fund, determined the duration of the transition period and only one body,
                        the Organization, determined the permissible degree of discrimination within
                        the transition period.</p>
                    <p>It was strongly emphasized to Mr. Percival that the negotiations regarding
                        these provisions should be conducted in Habana and not in either Washington
                        or London. It was pointed out that the respective delegations of the United
                        Kingdom and the United States and the various experts on these provisions
                        were available in Habana, that the U.S. Delegation has full authority and
                        the complete support of the Department, and that to shift the negotiations
                        away from Habana would cause only confusion and delay. Mr. Percival agreed
                        that the proper place for the conduct of these negotiations was Habana and
                        not Washington or London.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brown stressed the fact that the U.S. had already gone a long ways to
                        meet the British by our willingness to agree to the elimination of the prior
                        approval requirement from the Geneva Draft of Article 23 and the insertion
                        of an interpretative note on new preferences in accord with British desires.
                        Mr. Percival indicated he was personally convinced our position was
                            correct.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">In telegram 338 to Habana, March
                            12, not printed, the Department informed the Delegation about this
                            conversation with Mr. Percival, quoted portions of the British
                            memorandum, and noted that: “Inverchapel phoned Douglas in absence
                            Marshall and Lovett requesting his support British position.”

                    </p>
                    <p>Later that evening Mr. Percival called Mr. Weiss regarding further questions
                        which had arisen in his mind on the problem of dual control under the Geneva
                        Draft of Article 23. Mr. Percival stated that although he agreed with our
                        interpretation to the effect that there was <pb n="894" xml:id="pg_894"
                            facs="0404"/>no dual control of the degree of discrimination in the
                        transition period, he nevertheless felt, after reading the record of the
                        negotiations at Habana and other information available to him, that
                        confusion on this point still existed both in London and in Habana. He
                        quoted a statement made by Mr. Bronz at the Habana Conference which
                        suggested that there was dual control over the degree of discrimination
                        under the Geneva provisions. He pointed out that it would be of great
                        assistance in reaching agreement if he could point out definitively to his
                        government that there was no dual control. He therefore urged most strongly
                        that the Department either cable or telephone Mr. Wilcox to determine
                        conclusively whether such dual control existed or not. Mr. Percival
                        indicated that he would then transmit this information to his
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Weiss replied that (1) Mr. Wilcox had already been telephoned on this
                        point earlier in the day and very clearly indicated that there was no dual
                        control over the scope of discrimination under the Geneva provisions; (2) if
                        any confusion still remains as to whether dual control exists or not, the
                        proper place to clear the matter up is between our respective delegations at
                        Habana. To attempt to obtain interpretations of these provisions from Habana
                        and then to transmit such interpretation to Mr. Percival who would then
                        presumably pass them on to London would be an extremely awkward procedure
                        and might serve only to compound the existing confusion. In view of the
                        foregoing, Mr. Weiss indicated that he believed it undesirable for
                        Washington to intervene further in the negotiations at Habana and suggested
                        that the problem be taken up directly by our respective delegations at
                        Habana.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Percival continued to press further that the Department contact Mr.
                        Wilcox in order to obtain an answer as to the question of dual control and
                        urged that Mr. Weiss consult with other persons in the Department as to the
                        advisability of doing this. Mr. Weiss agreed to talk with other people in
                        the Department and to call Mr. Percival back.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Weiss thereupon telephoned Mr. Brown and presented the problem to him.
                        Mr. Brown stated most strongly his belief that further discussion on this
                        provision should be conducted at Habana and not in Washington and that to
                        attempt to do otherwise would only confuse the situation further. Mr. Weiss
                        telephoned Mr. Percival and informed him of Mr. Brown’s views.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d182fn4">On March 15, Ambassador Douglas, then in Washington,

                    <p>On March 24, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment came to an
                        end with the signing of the Final Act which incorporated the Havana Charter
                        for an International Trade Organization. The Charter was to enter into force
                        after a majority of the signatory nations approved. If such conditions had
                        not obtained within a year, the Charter was to take effect when certain
                        specified conditions had been met. For text see United Nations document

                    <p>The Charter for an International Trade Organization is essential to complete

                            xml:id="pg_900" facs="0410"/>The problems of employment, trade barriers,
                        cartels, commodity agreements, and international trade policy generally must
                        be dealt with concretely and on a firm foundation. If this is not done,
                        material progress in other fields of economic cooperation under the United
                        Nations will become increasingly difficult. Five years of careful
                        preparation and international negotiation demonstrate that the Charter
                        concluded at Havana is the best and most practicable agreement for the
                        purpose that can be devised at this stage of our international relations.
                        Viewed against the record of the inter-war years, the accomplishment of the
                        Havana Conference is truly remarkable.</p>

                    <p>Meeting concurrently in Habana February 28–March 24, 1948, was the First
                        Session of the Contracting Parties (<gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>’s) to
                        the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>). The Session was convened by the Secretary-General of the
                        United Nations in accordance with Article XXV of the General Agreement which
                        provided that “Representatives of the Contracting Parties shall meet from
                        time to time for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this
                        Agreement which involve joint action and, generally, with a view to
                        facilitating the operation and furthering the objectives of this Agreement.”
                        The following Contracting Parties participated in the First Session:
                        Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cuba, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the
                        United Kingdom, and the United States. In addition 14 countries attended as
                        Participating Observers, having signed the Geneva Final Act but not yet put
                        the Agreement into effect under the Protocol of Provisional Application
                        (Brazil, Burma, Ceylon, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, India, Lebanon, New
                        Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Southern Rhodesia, Syria, and the Union of South
                        Africa).</p>
                    <p>The United States sent a delegation of five “representatives” to the First
                        Session of the Contracting Parties, headed by John W. Evans of the
                        Department of Commerce. The other four, functioning in an advisory capacity
                        were: Honoré M. Catudal, John M. Leddy and Vernon L. Phelps of the
                        Department of State, and Edgar B. Brossard of the United States Tariff
                        Commission. Both Leddy and Phelps functioned on occasion as acting head of
                        the Delegation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Eric Wyndham White (a British national), Executive Secretary of the
                        Habana Conference, opened the first meeting on February 28. Mr. L. D.
                        Wilgress of Canada was elected Chairman of the Contracting Parties and Mr.
                        A. B. Speekenbrink of the Netherlands was elected Vice-Chairman. The
                        Contracting Parties met on 13 occasions subsequent to February 28, the final
                        meeting taking place on March 20. All <pb n="901" xml:id="pg_901"
                            facs="0411"/>of the meetings were in effect plenary in character. Four
                        protocols and a “Declaration” were signed on March 24 at a joint meeting
                        with the Habana Conference. (The Final Act of the Habana Conference and
                        Related Documents were also signed at this joint meeting.) A summary of the
                        accomplishments of this First Session of the Contracting Parties as based on
                        a United States Delegation paper, is printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>. A
                        fuller recital of the protocols of the First Session is printed in
                        Department of State Press Release Number 261 of March 31, 1948. Two
                        “Reports” by the Head of the United States Representatives to the First
                        Session, one official, the other confidential (Lot 57D284, Box 108, neither
                        printed), together constitute a valuable reference file on the work of the
                        First Session of the Contracting Parties. The Official Report provides a
                        good over-view and the Confidential Report has quite detailed information on
                        the organization, procedures and accomplishments of the conference.</p>
                    <p>One of the basic actions effected by the Contracting Parties at the First
                        Session was the supersession of certain provisions of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> by the provisions of the new Habana
                        Charter. In respect of one of two principal supersessions, the replacement
                        of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XIV of the 1947 Geneva
                        Conference (the Agreement) by the new Article 23 of the Habana Conference
                        (the Charter), the United States was able to give its support although the
                        general policy of the United States regarding supersession was to hold such
                        changes “to a minimum pending expression of opinion by the American public
                        and the Congress on the merits of the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        Charter, as perfected at Habana” (Official Report, Lot 57D284, Box 108), in
                        a word, to limit supersession to items of an emergency nature.</p>
                    <p>In this context the United States did not oppose a major effort mounted
                        especially by the United Kingdom and France to re-cast Article XIV of <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> (“Exceptions to the Rule of
                        Non-Discrimination”) along the lines of Article 23 of the Charter which had
                        just been definitively drafted at Habana (in conformance with United States
                        thinking; see documentation pages 802 ff.) The documentation that follows
                        the Summary of the Conference, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>, sets forth the
                        United States position on this question at the First Session of the
                        Contracting Parties and reprints <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> the new
                        Article XIV of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, with Annex J appended
                        thereto, in light of the importance of this article and its annex in
                        subsequent <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> history in terms of
                        permitted exceptions to the rule of non-discrimination for balance of
                        payments reasons.</p>
                    <p>The official files of the United States Representatives at the First Session
                        of the Contracting Parties is in Lot 57D284, Box 108. It is a very slim
                        file, as is also the file of official <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        documentation contained therein. Both files are reflective of the newness
                        and inexperience <pb n="902" xml:id="pg_902" facs="0412"/>of the Contracting
                        Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as they assembled and
                        held the brief First Session at Habana.</p>

                    <p>I have examined Attachment A–VIII to Document TAC B–4/48 dealing with
                        supercession of the provisions of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> by
                        the Havana Charter provisions. One of the reasons given for not favoring
                        supercession until the effective date of the Charter is that the Havana
                        Charter non-discriminatory provisions seem likely to be weaker than the
                        corresponding <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provisions. I suggest
                        that the opposite is closer to the truth.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> contains Article XIV which corresponds
                        with Article 23 of the Charter dealing with discrimination. Insofar as it
                        corresponds with the Geneva text of Article 23, the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> provision is stronger for the transitional period than the
                        corresponding provisions of the Havana Article 23. However, Article XIV of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> contains paragraph 6 which is not
                        included in the Geneva Charter. This provision allows Members an absolutely
                        free hand in the field of discrimination until January 1, 1949, with a
                        proviso that this period may be extended by majority vote of the contracting
                        parties “for such further periods as they may specify in respect of any
                        contracting party whose supply of convertible currencies is inadequate to
                        enable it to apply” the Geneva rules of non-discrimination for the
                        transitional period.</p>
                    <p>In view of the violent position taken by so many European countries against
                        the Geneva transitional rules, I feel we must anticipate that if the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XIV extends beyond January 1,
                        1949, we will get an irresistible pressure to extend the absolutely free
                        period until the Charter comes into force.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the net result of leaving the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        provision in effect is to have completely unrestricted discrimination up to
                        the time that the Charter enters into force. If we substitute the new Havana
                        text of Article 23 at this time, we will have various powers in the
                        contracting parties and in the Monetary Fund to limit discrimination at
                        least to some extent. Furthermore, we would have a pretty good rule to
                        prevent any expansion of discrimination beyond what existed on February 15,
                        1948.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing I would recommend immediate supercession of Article
                        XIV by Article 23 of the Havana Charter.</p>
                    <p>By this memo I am not intending to express any view on the more general
                        question of supercession but simply want to point out how <pb n="905"
                            xml:id="pg_905" facs="0415"/>things stand on this one Article in which I
                        am particularly interested. The changes in Article 21 and 24 of the Charter
                        (Articles XIII and XV of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) made at
                        Havana are immaterial in this connection and it would not appear to make any
                        difference to us whether or not those Articles are superceded.</p>

                            Tariffs and Trade, effective April 21. We are convinced that under new

                            barriers and elimination discrimination in international trade. At time
                            it was negotiated, we hoped Czecho would become bridge for increased
                            trade and better understanding between West and East. At that time, we

                            were of genuine significance and value and under U.S. legislation and
                            methods of conducting trade would justify corresponding obligations
                            assumed by U.S. This situation totally changed by violent assumption
                            power in Czecho by party whose open attitude is rejection cooperation in

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: This letter is intended to
                        amplify and confirm the remarks I made in our previous discussions over the
                        telephone regarding your letter of February 24, 1948<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d191fn1">Not printed.</note> with reference to the problem of
                        obtaining most-favored-nation treatment for the trade of the occupied
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>The Department is completely in accord with your view as to the desirability
                        of obtaining most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied areas. This
                        feeling on our part stems not only from an appreciation of the financial and
                        other responsibilities which our government has in the occupied areas but
                        also from the fact that the principle of most-favored-nation treatment has
                        been and continues to be a cardinal element in our foreign economic
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons we have made every reasonable effort to obtain
                        most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied areas through a commitment in
                        relation to either the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter or the
                        General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. To this end representations were
                        made by our Delegation at Habana, by the Department in Washington, by our
                        Embassy at Paris, and by our Delegation at the Tripartite discussions
                        recently concluded in London. Agreement was obtained on inclusion in the
                            <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter of a provision which
                        specifies that the Conference, which is to be the principal body of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>, shall determine the conditions upon
                        which the rights and obligations of the Charter shall be extended to the
                        occupied areas. As you have noted, this provision keeps the door open for
                        bringing the occupied areas into the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> and
                        is thus desirable, but we agree that it is not enough. Hence, in the
                        discussions on this question in Habana and elsewhere we have put the various
                        countries concerned on notice that the United States will expect a provision
                        according reciprocal most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied areas to
                        be included in the aid agreements under the recovery programs for Europe and
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The Department intends, in line with the suggestion in your letter, to seek
                        to incorporate a commitment regarding most-favored-nation treatment in each
                        of the bilateral agreements under the European Recovery Program and the
                        Chinese aid program. It is expected that the commitment will be general in
                        character, applying on a reciprocal basis to the commerce of the parties to
                        the respective agreements but subject to the exceptions of the sort
                        permitted under the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter, such as
                        measures permitted for security or balance of payments reasons. <pb n="913"
                            xml:id="pg_913" facs="0423"/>It will be made clear that this commitment
                        will apply to the occupied areas of western Germany, Japan and southern
                        Korea for which the United States is responsible.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I should like to make
                        several comments. First, although the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        Charter does not contain a specific obligation requiring the extension of
                        most-favored-nation treatment to the occupied areas, it also does not
                        contain any prohibition against the extension of such treatment by any
                        Member if the latter should so desire. Hence, the “discrimination” against
                        the occupied areas under the Charter to which you refer is one of omission,
                        not commission. Secondly, without in any way minimizing the importance of
                        obtaining most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied areas, I should
                        like to stress the fact that the Charter in its present form contains a
                        great number of far-reaching commitments of vital significance for the
                        establishment of a mutually advantageous system of international economic
                        relations and the achievement of the objectives of our foreign economic
                        policy. These commitments cover the field not only of commercial policy but
                        also of restrictive business practices, intergovernmental commodity
                        agreements, employment and economic development. It would seem that the
                        achievement of these extensive commitments is so important and the
                        fulfillment of the objectives of the Charter so significant to the welfare
                        of the United States that it would be a great pity to sacrifice or
                        jeopardize them in any way because of the failure to obtain in the Charter a
                        provision for most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied areas.</p>
                    <p>I am confident that through the agreements under the European and Chinese aid
                        programs we shall obtain the most-favored-nation treatment for the occupied
                        areas that you and I both agree is highly desirable. It is my sincere hope
                        that the Department can count on your strong support for the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter and the program it represents.<note

                            enumerated the advantages that would accrue from extending

                        recommendation of Mr. Clayton, that the Department would reverse its
                        previous stand, and that we would put the General Agreement on Tariffs and

                        Czechoslovakia on April 20 or 21.</p>

                            <item>The strong opposition of five out of seven of the <gloss

                            the Berlin question where the United States position was based on the
                            necessity of living up to international agreements; “our failure to do

                        preparing a draft. Hollis is to prepare the draft in such a way that it

                        and certain minor rectifications of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> or
                        of our previous proclamations, so that the Czech question becomes merely one
                        part of a general proclamation.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that proclaiming with respect to Czechoslovakia on April
                        21 will involve some violation on our part, since we are actually obligated
                        to give effect to the concessions on that day and at least ten days or two
                        weeks’ notice will be required. However, such a violation seems very
                        unimportant.</p>

                        and are reluctant even attend meeting to discuss matter. We are satisfied

                    <p>Alternatives therefore are proclaim rates for Czecho or take unilateral

                        might be invoked to justify latter action but that this would by strained
                        interpretation and court would probably hold we had breached entire
                        agreement. British and Dutch flatly state they do not think Protocol allows
                        partial withdrawal and that if we withdraw from Czecho we break agreement as
                        regards all parties.</p>
                    <p>If we fail proclaim concessions of principal interest to Czecho, it would be

                        Czecho, e.g. flat glass, negotiated with Belgium, of which Czecho is

                        President that, Czecho was adopting policies tending defeat purposes Act and
                        therefore that most-favored-nation treatment should be withheld. We should
                        also bear in mind that the United States signed the International Wheat

                        maximum prices and certain other importing countries including Poland and
                        Czechoslovakia to buy specified quantities of wheat at not less than certain

                        runs for 5 years. The only escape clause is one that can be used in event of
                        eventual hostilities. It would be very inconsistent to denounce the Geneva
                        Agreement vis-à-vis Czechoslovakia and leave the Wheat Agreement in effect

                        no alternative but to proclaim Czech rates. They feel such action will

                    <p>Failure to carry out our agreement vis-à-vis Czechoslovakia would not only
                        seriously weaken our standing with other countries but would seriously
                        weaken our position in insisting Soviets live up to their commitments, e.g.
                        in Berlin. Our whole ability to stay in Berlin depends on Soviet observance
                        these commitments. If we don’t live up to our multilateral Agreements we can
                        hardly expect them to miss this chance to use it against us in this period
                        of tension.</p>
                    <p>Recommend therefore we proclaim rates for Czecho with clear statement

                        <item>During negotiation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year at
                            Geneva question arose as to whether occupied areas of western Germany,
                            Japan and southern Korea should be brought within terms of <gloss

                            referred for further consideration to <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                                >ITO</gloss> Conference which was to open at Habana. Final note to
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> was adopted at Geneva
                            indicating that applicability of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            to trade of occupied areas had not been dealt with and was reserved for

                        <item>At Habana U.S. Delegation made determined efforts to bring occupied
                            areas within terms of <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter but
                            these efforts failed, principally because of opposition of UK, France,
                            Czechoslovakia, Poland and China. This opposition seemed to be based in
                            part on political considerations and in part on economic ones, including
                            fear of German and Japanese economic penetration and of possibility of
                            heavy influx of imports from these areas in future. Legal status of
                            occupied areas and competence of Habana Conference to consider problem
                            of their relation to Charter were also brought into question. As result
                            of this opposition, all that U.S. Delegation was able to get at Habana
                            was provision in Charter whereby <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                            would, on application by competent authorities, determine conditions on
                            which rights and obligations of Charter would apply to occupied

                            efforts also failed but US did put UK and France as well as other
                            countries concerned on notice that in connection with European and
                            Chinese bilateral aid agreements we would insist on commitment providing
                            m-f-n treatment to commerce of occupied areas on reciprocal

                            Economic Cooperation U.S. suggested that agreement include m-f-n
                            provisions applicable to commerce of parties to agreement. Such
                            provisions, had they been included, would have applied to British and
                            American Zones of Germany since they were parties to agreement, but
                            would not have covered Japan or Korea since neither they nor US (which
                            might have acted on their behalf if it were signatory) were parties to
                            agreement, Participating countries would not accept m-f-n commitment in

                            support of economies of occupied areas represents economic burden on US.
                            If these areas are to become self-sustaining and economic burden on US
                            reduced, it is essential that their exports be developed and that,
                            therefore, unwarranted discrimination against such exports be eliminated
                            so far as possible.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>In this connection economies of Jap and southern Korea are no
                            different from those of occupied areas in Europe for which US is
                            responsible. This country is giving direct financial and other economic
                            support to Jap and southern Korea. Discrimination against exports of
                            these areas makes it more difficult for economies of these areas to
                            stand on their own feet and increases financial and other assistance
                            which this country must supply. Moreover, since this assistance in part
                            is incorporated directly and indirectly in the manufacture of exports
                            from Japan and southern Korea, discrimination against these exports
                            represents, in a sense, discrimination against US. From this viewpoint
                            our interest in occupied areas is similar to our interest in our own
                            dependencies.</item>

                            colonies. Since British likely to be in balance-of-payments difficulties
                            for next several years, commitment in exchange of notes would still
                            leave British Govt relatively free during this period to discriminate

                            free to purchase from whatever sources they wish, and if they do not
                            want to buy from Japan, there is nothing in exchange of notes requiring

                        <item>Commitments in exchange of notes remain in force only until Jan 1,
                            1951, and are terminable on that date or at any time thereafter upon six
                            months notice. During next 21/2 years when commitment is in force,
                            British would still retain, as indicated para C–3 above, wide latitude
                            with respect to their trade policy because of likelihood continuing
                            balance-of-payment difficulties. Also, during this period it does not
                            seem likely that any great flood of exports will come forth from Japan
                            to swamp British markets. General shortages, not surpluses, are likely
                            to be problem during next several years. If Jap exports should become
                            serious threat to British after this period, then they would be in
                            position to terminate exchange of notes if they wished. Also, if British
                            argue they need to protect their cotton textile industry against Jap
                            competition, it may be pointed out that Jap cotton textiles intended for
                            export will be largely low-grade type and therefore to considerable
                            degree non-competitive with bulk British cotton textiles.</item>

                        events related to the Second Session of the Contracting Parties to the
                        General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which was held at Geneva, Switzerland
                        August 16–September 14, 1948. The Chairman of the United States Delegation
                        was Leroy D. Stinebower, Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of
                        State for Economic Affairs; and the Vice Chairman was John M. Leddy,
                        Adviser, Division of Commercial Policy, Department of State. The advisory
                        staff of the Delegation consisted of Carl D. Corse, Acting Associate Chief,
                        Division of Commercial Policy; Walter Hollis, Office of the Legal Adviser,
                        Department of State; and William L. Marbury, Department of the Army. The
                        United States Delegation files for this Second Session of the Contracting
                        Parties are in Lot 57D278, Boxes 108 and 109. As regards the working files
                        of the Delegation itself, this file seems to be incomplete except for
                        position papers; there is, however, a complete collection of the General
                        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade documentation of the Session, which is much
                        more elaborate than that of the First Session of the Contracting Parties.
                        The Delegation file is located wholly in Box 108, except for an important
                        file entitled “Most-Favored-Nation Treatment for Germany” (which
                        chronologically spans a greater period than that of the Second Session)
                        which is in Box 109.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important achievements of the Second Session from the United
                        States point of view was the agreement that was negotiated to extend
                        most-favored-nation treatment to western Germany; and the documentation
                        printed here is largely concerned with this matter. However, the first
                        document, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>, deals with an organizational matter
                        related to the incipient international trade organization that affected the
                        Contracting Parties not only at Geneva but for some years subsequently—the
                        establishment at Geneva at this time of the Interim Commission for the
                        International Trade Organization (<gloss target="#t_ICITO1"

                                    negotiations with US and possibly other contracting parties.
                                    Upon accession by any new country to <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                        >GATT</gloss> any existing trade agreement between US and

                                    and other countries. It should be explained that <gloss
                                        target="#t_TA1">TA</gloss> Act will again be before Congress
                                    for renewal in period preceding June 30, 1949 and that
                                    consequently US Govt feels any tariff negotiations it might
                                    undertake under present Act must be concluded prior
                                    consideration by Congress legislation for its extension beyond
                                    June 30, 1949. Should be emphasized this is merely preliminary
                                    inquiry and should not be construed as proposal enter into
                                    tariff negotiations; that until response each Gov to which
                                    inquiry addressed is obtained, and the matter considered at
                                    Second Session of Contracting Parties, US cannot of course make
                                    any definite commitments. Moreover, under procedures required by
                                    Trade Agreements Act, we would have to issue formal public
                                    notice intention negotiate with other country including list
                                    products under consideration for granting concessions by US.
                                    Such notice would probably have to be issued by middle Oct at

                    <p>Mr. Garside was invited to come to the Department for a discussion concerning
                        the position of the U.S. on the various items on the agenda for the second
                        session of the Contracting Parties of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> (see also <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> No.
                        169, July 29, to Canberra<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Not
                        printed.</note>).</p>
                    <p>After a few general comments on what happened at Habana, Mr. Corse began the
                        discussion by saying that because of the very short session that has been
                        planned (ten days), we felt it would be desirable to explain the position
                        the U.S. expected to take on the various items that will be brought up at
                        Geneva.</p>
                    <p>In explaining point 4<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">This is a reference to
                            provisional agenda item 4 noted in telegram 93 to Ottawa <hi
                                rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> he said that the general provisions
                        of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> corresponded to the language of
                        the Geneva and not the Habana Charter, but the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> provided for supersession of those <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provisions with the corresponding
                        provisions of the Habana Charter when it comes into force. At Habana
                        proposals had been made to incorporate into the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> immediately the corresponding Charter provisions. The U.S.
                        opposed complete replacement of all the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> provisions prior to the coming into force of the Charter,
                        but agreed to replacing Articles XIV and XXIV with the Habana language,
                        which had been done.</p>
                    <p>He stated that the U.S. position had not changed since Habana, that we are
                        still opposed to complete supercession in advance of the coming into force
                        of the Charter—point 4(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)—but that we would be
                        prepared to consider the replacement of specific Articles—4(<hi
                            rend="italic">b</hi>). Mr. Phelps stated that early in June our Embassy
                        at Canberra had discussed this point with Australian officials, who stated
                        that Australia might favor 4(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>). Mr. Phelps expressed
                        the hope that Australia would change her position and support that of the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <pb n="929" xml:id="pg_929" facs="0439"/>
                    <p>Point 5 of the agenda is for the purpose of clarifying after the Charter
                        comes into force the relations of Contracting Parties to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> who are not members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> with those who are members. Mr. Corse
                        stated that no agreement was reached on this point at Habana and that at the
                        Geneva meeting the U.S. will support the proposal that <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries which are not members of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> will be governed by the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in their relations with <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> countries pending their becoming members of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>. Mr. Phelps mentioned the fact that
                        the Department had been informed by our Embassy at Canberra that Australia
                        is in agreement with the U.S. position on this point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Corse said that point 6 presents difficulties for the U.S. because of the
                        U.S. domestic situation, i.e., allegations of some Congressmen that the U.S.
                        Executive Branch under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is creating a
                        “little <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>” prior to the consideration of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter by Congress. Therefore it is
                        difficult for us even to agree to setting up a separate <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Secretariat to function between meetings
                        because this might be construed as an “international organization”. At
                        Habana the problem was met temporarily by an agreement among the Contracting
                        Parties that all communications between the first and second sessions be
                        addressed to the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, (Mr.
                        Wilgress of Canada) in care of Mr. Wyndham White, Executive Secretary,
                            <gloss target="#t_ICITO1">ICITO</gloss>. He said that the U.S. position
                        on this item is still under consideration.</p>
                    <p>Point 7 is merely an affirmative report on which of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries signed the Protocol of
                        Provisional Application, the status of the other protocols pertaining to the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Garside asked if at the Geneva meeting the U.S. would be able to state
                        which provisions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> are and which
                        are not inconsistent with existing U.S. legislation. Mr. Corse informed him
                        that we would not be able to do so, although our studies to date have
                        indicated only a relatively few cases where they are inconsistent.</p>
                    <p>With respect to point 8, it was stated that the U.S. would like to see Chile
                        become a member of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Mr. Phelps
                        also stated that we had informed the Chileans that we would like to see them
                        come to Geneva prepared to sign the Protocol of Provisional Application, and
                        that if that is not possible the U.S. would be willing to extend the period
                        not to exceed two months beyond the closing date of the second session. This
                        latter point, however, has not been communicated to the Chileans. Mr. Corse
                        added that by this procedure it would be possible for Chile to get about
                        four of the full six months’ delay which it had requested.</p>
                    <p>In regard to points 9 and 10 Mr. Corse said that the Executive Secretary, Mr.
                        Wyndham White, had sent inquiries to the countries which had participated in
                        the Habana Conference, excepting the Republic of <pb n="930" xml:id="pg_930"
                            facs="0440"/>Indonesia, asking them if they were interested in joining
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, including in conjunction
                        therewith tariff negotiations. Subsequently we requested our missions in
                        these countries to ascertain the reaction of these countries to Wyndham
                        White’s inquiry, and whether they would be interested in entering into
                        purely exploratory discussions with the U.S. to see if a basis exists for
                        tariff negotiations with this country. Mr. Phelps explained that although we
                        are interested in extending the membership of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>, U.S. participation in an early program of tariff
                        negotiations under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> raises certain
                        problems, in the light of the one year extension of the Trade Agreements
                        Act. He said that if any negotiations are held by the U.S. under the present
                        one year authority, it would be necessary to make the required public
                        announcement not later than the middle of October and preferably in
                        September. Mr. Phelps also mentioned that the Republic of Indonesia had not
                        been approached because the Netherlands-Indies was presently included in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> as a part of the Kingdom of the
                        Netherlands.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Corse said that with respect to points 11 and 12, i.e. renegotiations
                        with Pakistan and Cuba, the U.S. has no position as yet. In any case we
                        could not participate in any such negotiations at Geneva in view of our
                        required domestic procedures of public announcements, hearings, etc. He also
                        explained point 13 by saying that the Netherlands is having some difficulty
                        with Cuba over consular fees.</p>
                    <p>Point 14 deals with a proposed clarification of the language of certain items
                        in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> tariff schedules, none of
                        which, it is believed, would be of direct interest to Australia.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that the U.S. has been interested in point 15 for some
                        time, and that we tried to get a commitment concerning M-F-N treatment for
                        the occupied areas, at both Geneva and Habana. It was explained that as long
                        as Germany, Japan and Korea are under military occupation and the U.S. is
                        pouring money into these areas, the U.S. feels strongly that their exports
                        should get M-F-N treatment. Mr. Corse further explained that after
                        occupation is ended these countries will be on their own feet, but until
                        that time the U.S. will continue to press for M-F-N treatment for them. He
                        agreed that this problem had been partially resolved in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> agreements.</p>
                    <p>Point 16 was also placed on the agenda at the request of the U.S. Mr. Corse
                        said that organic legislation for U.S. trust territories has been submitted
                        to Congress which permits exports from these trust territories to enter the
                        U.S. free of duty and with certain preferences. Since this (i.e.,
                        institution of new preferences) is not permitted by the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> the U.S. proposes to seek a waiver to
                        permit such action under Article XXV of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. On the other hand, under this proposed legislation
                        imports into these territories from all countries including the U.S. would
                        bear the same rate of duty. It was pointed out that <pb n="931"
                            xml:id="pg_931" facs="0441"/>our position is analogous to the Australian
                        position with respect to Papua and New Guinea.</p>
                    <p>Under point 17 the U.S. envisages a relatively informal arrangement between
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries and the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Mr. Phelps said that possibly an exchange
                        of letters between the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> chairman and
                        the Fund would serve the purpose, and in this exchange it could be spelled
                        out that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would be prepared to
                        consult and make the findings as envisaged under Article XV of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. It was also explained that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> requires that special exchange agreements
                        be negotiated between those <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries
                        which are members of the Fund and those which are not yet members. Mr.
                        Phelps said that the U.S. would propose that a drafting committee be set up
                        at the second session of the Contracting Parties to deal with this matter,
                        which could report to the third session of the Contracting Parties.</p>
                    <p>It was stated that we have no definite views as to the date for the third
                        session of the Contracting Parties, point 18. Mr. Corse explained that the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provides for a meeting in January,
                        if the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter has not entered into
                        force, but that it might be desirable to postpone this meeting until a later
                        date. Mr. Phelps mentioned that if a round of tariff negotiations should be
                        scheduled for early next year such postponement would be desirable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Corse closed the meeting by saying that we would welcome any comments
                        which the Australians would have to offer, either on the agenda or on any
                        points raised in today’s conversation. Mr. Garside replied that since a copy
                        of the agenda had already been sent to his Government he would report to it
                        by reference to the agenda.</p>
                    <p>A copy of the agenda which served as a basis for the conversation is
                            attached.<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4">Not printed.</note>

                            had not yet approached British specifically on this question. In view

                            Ambassador and Bliss concur, is to make every effort obtain British
                            support for third alternative position, namely drafting of agreement on

                        participation in drafting similar agreement on Japan but has strongly urged
                        Foreign Office to instruct delegation at Geneva to begin informal

                            >GATT</gloss> countries would want others to accede. Question of whether
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries will let them do so is
                        clearly relevant in a <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting. Suggest
                        that draft <gloss target="#t_mfn1">MFN</gloss> agreement be put forward in
                        present form permitting accession by non-<gloss target="#t_GATT1"

                        this point is significant stumbling block in getting agreement, we would be

                    <p>Another major initiative undertaken by the United States at the Second
                        Session of the Contracting Parties looked towards the implementation of
                        Article XV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which called for
                        cooperation between the Contracting Parties and the International Monetary
                        Fund with regard to the interrelated questions of exchange rates and
                        quantitative restrictions. On August 24 the Contracting Parties accepted a
                        United States proposal dated August 18 (introduced by the United States
                        delegate, John M. Leddy) which formulated the drafts for an exchange of
                        letters between the Contracting Parties and the Fund which established
                        cooperative arrangements between the two with regard to Article XV. The
                        decision of the Contracting Parties had the approval of the International
                        Monetary Fund observer at the Second Session, Ahmed Zaki Saad. The texts of
                        the letters subsequently exchanged are printed <hi rend="italic"

                        1948.</p>
                    <p>“The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has now been put into
                        provisional application by all but one of the countries participating in the
                        negotiation thereof, provides in paragraph 1 of Article XV as follows:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">

                                pursue a coordinated policy with regard to exchange questions within
                                the jurisdiction of the Fund and questions of quantitative
                                restrictions and other trade measures within the jurisdiction of the

                    </p>
                    <p>Throughout the Agreement various provisions call for consultation or

                        the contracting parties to the General Agreement acting jointly, and the
                        International Monetary Fund on matters of common concern. In particular,
                        paragraph 2 of Article XV calls for a wide range of consultation, and
                        paragraph 3 of Article XV provides: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>‘The <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> shall seek

                    </p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been
                        given only provisional rather than definitive application, it is the view of
                        the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> that an elaborate
                        agreement to implement paragraph 3 quoted above is not necessary at this
                        time. However, questions may arise in the interim which would require the
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> to seek the co-operation
                        of the Fund.</p>
                    <p>Under such circumstances it is proposed by the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Contracting Parties</hi> that the Fund agree to co-operate with the <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> in carrying out the provisions
                        of the General Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof and, in
                        particular, to consult, at the request of <pb n="938" xml:id="pg_938"
                            facs="0448"/>the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi>, on
                        matters as contemplated by the General Agreement. If such cases arise, the
                        Chairman of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> will notify
                        the Managing Director of the Fund of each particular instance in which the
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> desire consultation and
                        will furnish the Fund with all information available which may assist the
                        Fund in considering the question. Since various provisions of the General
                        Agreement call for consultation between the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting
                            Parties</hi> and the Fund, it might be necessary in particular cases to
                        await a meeting of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> before
                        formal consultation could be undertaken. However, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Contracting Parties</hi> have authorised their Chairman to initiate
                        requests, either at the direction of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting
                            Parties</hi> or on the Chairman’s own initiative if the contracting
                        parties are not in session, for the Fund to consult with the <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> in accordance with the
                        provisions of the General Agreement. This arrangement should make it
                        possible for the Fund to undertake with a minimum of delay such studies as
                        may be necessary and should afford the Fund opportunity to become familiar
                        with the subject matter involved in advance of consultation with the <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> in particular cases.</p>
                    <p>The Fund may from time to time wish to request consultation with the <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> on matters of common interest,
                        and, in such cases, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> will
                        be prepared to consult upon such requests.</p>
                    <p>Any request for consultation by either the Fund or the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Contracting Parties</hi> shall be accompanied by available information
                        which would contribute to the effectiveness of the consultation. In such
                        cases, due regard shall be paid to the need to safeguard confidential
                        information and to any special obligations of the Fund and the <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Contracting Parties</hi> in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The particular procedures in implementation of these arrangements can be
                        worked out case by case until sufficient experience has been acquired on the
                        basis of which more formal procedures can be developed if necessary.</p>
                    <p>If the foregoing arrangements are acceptable to the Fund, a reply to that
                        effect would be appreciated.”</p>

                        Tariffs and Trade, which opened in Geneva on August 16, completed its work
                        on September 14. It has laid plans designed to increase further the value of
                        the Agreement to the countries already parties, including the United States,
                        and to enable more countries to become parties.</p>
                    <p>Under the General Agreement itself, negotiated in 1947 by the United States
                        and twenty-two other countries, each country agrees to certain general rules
                        for the conduct of its international trade and grants to all the others a
                        schedule of specific concessions in its tariff treatment of imports,
                        including reductions in tariffs, bindings of moderate rates or of free
                        treatment, reductions or eliminations of preferences, and the like. These
                        concessions cover about one-half of total world trade.</p>

                    <p>The major accomplishment of the meeting just ended is adoption of procedures
                        for bringing additional countries into the Agreement as rapidly as possible
                        through tariff negotiations with them. On inquiry by the contracting parties
                        it was found that several countries not yet parties are definitely
                        interested in early accession. A timetable was accordingly adopted for
                        negotiations with them. Requests for concessions are to be exchanged between
                        the present parties and the new countries and also among the new countries
                        by January 15, 1949. Definitive negotiations are scheduled to open at Geneva
                        on April 11, 1949. The new countries which will negotiate are: Denmark,
                        Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Finland, Greece, Haiti, Italy, Nicaragua,
                        Peru, Sweden, and Uruguay.</p>
                    <p>So far as the United States is concerned, negotiations will be conducted
                        under the usual trade-agreement procedure as recently amended by the Trade
                        Agreements Extension Act of 1948. The customary notice of intention to
                        negotiate, accompanied by announcement of products to be considered for
                        possible concession by this country, will be made as soon as the necessary
                        preparatory work is completed by the interdepartmental trade-agreements
                        organization.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Except in certain special cases there will be no reopening of negotiations
                        among the countries which are already parties to the Agreement. However,
                        Brazil was granted temporary permission to establish rates on three items
                        which are higher than otherwise permitted under the General Agreement, in
                        consideration of the fact that the Brazilian Congress has applied rates on a
                        number of other items which are lower than the maximum permitted by the
                        Agreement. Within 60 days the interested countries are to negotiate a
                        definitive adjustment of the concessions involved. Ceylon and Pakistan were
                        also authorized to renegotiate certain concessions which each had granted to
                        other countries. Cuba was granted permission to renegotiate with the United
                        States the rates of duty on six items which Cuba is finding it difficult to
                        apply as originally negotiated, the understanding being that the United
                        States is to receive full compensation for any modifications agreed to.
                        These adjustments are to be worked out bilaterally subject to final action
                        at the time of the negotiations next spring. Any other negotiations among
                        countries already parties to the Agreement are likely to be in the nature of
                        completion of work which it was not possible to finish at the 1947
                        conference, none of it involving the United States.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important achievements of the conference was agreement by a
                        substantial number of countries to extend to western Germany
                        most-favored-nation treatment with respect to merchandise trade on a
                        reciprocal basis. This undertaking is incorporated in a separate document,
                        not a part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and was opened for
                        signature on September 14. So far nine countries have signed, and it is
                        expected that most of the remaining countries represented at the meeting
                        will sign in the near future.</p>

                    <p>Some changes were also made in the Agreement which it was felt by the
                        contracting parties were an improvement over the original text. These
                        changes were based largely on work done at the Havana Trade Conference
                        subsequent to the conclusion of the General Agreement.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Chile was accorded an extension of time, to February 17, 1949,
                        in which to become a contracting party to the Agreement even though, after
                        negotiating concessions at Geneva, Chile did not put the Agreement
                        provisionally into effect by June 30, 1948, the time originally set.</p>
                    <p>Arrangements were made under which the United States will be free to accord
                        preferences to imports from the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
                        Though technically this constitutes establishment of a new preference, it
                        will permit the working out of a trading arrangement which will promote the
                        advancement of the peoples of the trust territory consistent with the United
                        States’ obligations under this country’s Trusteeship Agreement with the
                        Security Council of the United Nations.</p>

                    <p>During the session just ended, the United States submitted to the contracting
                        parties under Article XXIII of the General Agreement a problem arising out
                        of an import licensing system applied by Cuba with respect to a wide range
                        of products, including raw cotton and cotton, rayon and wool fabrics and
                        wearing apparel. Cuba’s action had the effect of preventing the importation
                        of these products from the United States and other countries, thus
                        nullifying in considerable part the benefits granted by Cuba in the General
                        Agreement. The contracting parties recommended that Cuba promptly take steps
                        to relieve the immediate difficulties and to consult with repersentatives of
                        the United States Government at Havana with a view to finding a mutually
                        satisfactory solution of the problems that have arisen in connection with
                        the Cuban import controls under Cuban Resolution <pb n="942" xml:id="pg_942"
                            facs="0452"/>530. On September 14 the Cuban Government issued a
                        resolution removing the restrictions on the importation of all products
                        except piece-goods remnants and waste other than industrial. The
                        restrictions on the importation of these products will be discussed between
                        the Cuban Government and the United States Embassy at Havana.</p>

                    <p>As you will readily see, the foregoing establishes a very tight timetable. In
                        order for us to transmit our definitive request lists by January 15, it will
                        be necessary to hold the public hearings in December. This means that we
                        shall have to issue the usual public notice very early in November, probably
                        on November 5 if the President approves. Allowing a month for the submission
                        of briefs, this would make it possible to set December 6 as the closing date
                        for filing briefs, and December 13 as the date for opening the public
                        hearings.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, in order that the Country Committees and the Trade Agreements
                        Committee may be able to prepare the list of items to accompany the public
                        notice, it will be greatly appreciated if the data outlined above can be
                        submitted to the Committee in the very near future, and if possible not
                        later than September 30. In accordance with the suggestion made by members
                        of your staff in informal discussion of this matter, it may be necessary, in
                        order to complete the work by September 30, to exclude detailed data on the
                        duty-free items if total imports in 1939 or 1947 did not exceed $10,000.</p>

                        more than half of total world trade. The forthcoming tariff negotiations
                        will extend significantly the area and the volume of world trade covered by
                        this comprehensive code of fair conduct for international trade, and will

                        as 23 countries (the Contracting Parties) with 11 or 12 additional countries
                        (the participation of Colombia is not yet certain) involves negotiating
                        problems of great complexity. It should also be pointed out that the
                        difficulty of tariff negotiations does not vary proportionately with the
                        size of a country. In fact, the negotiations with some of the smaller
                        countries at the forthcoming meeting may involve more complex problems and
                        more difficult negotiating problems than did the negotiations with the more
                        important original Contracting Parties. As in the case of the original
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations, however, the
                        multilateral negotiating procedure will result in a substantial net saving
                        compared to the cost of carrying out the negotiations separately with each
                        country.</p>
                    <p>It is contemplated that U.S. participation in the Third Session of the
                        Contracting Parties (as distinct from the tariff negotiating meeting) can be
                        handled by members of the delegation to the tariff negotiations and no
                        separation of the delegations for the two meetings is therefore
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that the U.S. Delegation to the tariff negotiating meeting
                        and the third session of the Contracting Parties will require a total
                        membership of approximately 100, in two general categories: <list>

                        delegation.]</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that the Third Session will last from April 11 to June 30
                        although the negotiations may possibly go into July (fiscal 1950).</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Pete</hi>: You requested in your letter of
                        November 8 information concerning Congressional action on the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter.<note n="1" xml:id="d216fn1">In his
                            letter of November 8, 1948, not printed, Mr. Peterson noted that Swedish
                            ratification was dependent on American plans, because the Swedes felt
                            that “since <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> is fundamentally an
                            American project, carried forward with great vigor by stimulation from
                            the American side, small countries like Sweden … would be slow in
                            ratifying the Charter until they knew what the United States was going
                            to do regarding ratification.” (560.AL/11–848)</note> The Department is
                        now developing its legislative program and the <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss> Charter is the economic item having highest priority. There
                        seems to be little doubt but that the Charter will be presented fairly early
                        during the forthcoming session. It is significant to note that the
                        Democratic party platform stated specifically, “We strongly indorse our
                        country’s adherence to the International Trade Organization.”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d216fn2">On Election Day, November 2, 1948, the Democratic Party
                            candidate for the presidency, President Harry S. Truman, was elected;
                            and a Democratic Party majority was elected to the two Houses of
                            Congress.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We are now, as you might expect, to some extent entangled in the political
                        process, for a decision on how and when the Charter should be submitted
                        depends in part on the organization of the Congress. We hope to take full
                        advantage of the White House-Congressional leadership contacts, and we will
                        wish to be guided by these political judgments, particularly with respect to
                        the timing of presentation.</p>
                    <p>For your own information, it now appears that we shall send the Charter up in
                        the form of a joint resolution, although a decision has not been made as to
                        whether it should be handled by the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations
                        Committees or the Ways and Means and Finance Committees. There are questions
                        of this character, the answers to which depend substantially upon political
                        judgments which we hope will emerge from the White House and Congressional
                        leaders. You may certainly reaffirm to the Swedes that we propose to make
                        every effort to obtain Congressional approval as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you will be able to use this somewhat inconclusive information
                        with good effect insofar as Swedish plans for ratification of the Charter
                        are concerned.</p>

                            requested an extension of the Reciprocal Trade Act which for the
                            previous 14 years had “been an essential element of United States
                            foreign policy.” Secretary Marshall testifying before a House of
                            Representatives Ways and Means subcommittee on May 6, 1948, stated that
                            the act was “the cornerstone and keystone of our foreign economic
                            policy.” For texts, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                                Agreements Act</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Department is opposed to the proposed bill for a one-year extension
                            of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act through June 30, 1949, sponsored
                            by Representative Gearhart and recently approved by the Ways and Means
                            Committee of the House of Representatives. We believe that the proposed
                            bill’s requirements make impossible the negotiation of a trade agreement
                            within the time allowed and that, although the bill appears to permit
                            the program to continue, it actually sets up such conditions as to make
                            it unworkable.</p>
                        <p>The bill provides that after the preparation of the usual published list
                            of import products to be considered for the possible granting of
                            concessions in the agreement, and before entering into such agreement,
                            the Tariff Commission shall report to the President with regard to such
                            products: 1) the extent to which duties and other import restrictions
                                <pb n="949" xml:id="pg_949" facs="0459"/>may be modified; or 2) the
                            extent to which additional import restrictions may be imposed; or 3) the
                            maximum periods (if any) for which obligations may be undertaken to
                            continue existing customs or excise treatment, without causing or
                            threatening serious injury to domestic producers or impairing the
                            national defense. The bill also provides that the President shall submit
                            to Congress for its veto any agreement which would involve any tariff
                            action exceeding that recommended in the Tariff Commission report.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Department’s Position</hi>—The Department finds the
                            proposed bill objectionable in the following respects: One-year
                            extension provides insufficient time to organize effectively and carry
                            through necessary negotiations, especially since the requirement that no
                            agreement may be entered into until the Tariff Commission has reported
                            to the President may cause considerable delay. The bill places upon the
                            Tariff Commission, in effect though not in terms, the sole
                            responsibility for determining how far a tariff rate may be cut. This
                            would concentrate upon the Commission the full weight of pressures of
                            special interests. The Department feels an unnecessary burden is placed
                            on the Commission in the requirement that it determine for each product
                            considered the maximum tariff concession which could be made without
                            injury, regardless of whether as a matter of policy and balance in the
                            negotiation the President would wish to offer that much of a cut. Also
                            objectionable is the requirement that the Tariff Commission should not
                            participate in the recommendations to the President nor in the
                            negotiation of any agreement. Thus, the President is deprived of the
                            services of competent officials. The Department feels also that the
                            President would be put in an improper position in the event he found it
                            in the public interest to exceed the limits set by the Tariff
                            Commission. He would have to submit to the Congress the decision of a
                            disagreement between himself and an administrative agency which, though
                            created by Congress, is nevertheless operated by his own appointees.</p>

                        <p>Since the first, of the year we have moved forward in our program for the
                            modernization and extension of our commercial treaty structure by
                            initiating negotiations for treaties of friendship, commerce and
                            navigation with Australia, France and Ireland. In addition, draft
                            treaties have recently been presented to India, Iran, the Netherlands
                            New Zealand, Pakistan and the Union of South Africa. We have forwarded
                            to Embassy Brussels a draft treaty to be discussed with Belgium and are
                            planning presentation of proposals to the Colombians who have indicated
                            that they wish to conclude a treaty with us. We are also considering
                            presentation of proposals to Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>The treaties with Italy and China, negotiation of which was concluded
                            some time ago, are awaiting exchange of ratifications. (See page 16,
                            January 19, 1948 issue of <hi rend="italic">Current Economic

                            The Lebanese government continues to withhold signature of the treaty,
                            negotiation of which was concluded last year.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations with the Philippines, which have reached an advanced stage,
                            are being delayed by the serious problems which have arisen in the form
                            of concessions requested by the Philippines. The Czech negotiations,
                            which had been initiated in 1947, were dropped following the Communist
                            coup. Although we presented draft treaties during 1946 and 1947 to
                            Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Egypt and the UK, negotiations have not yet been
                            undertaken with these countries.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The US is proceeding with its program of negotiating treaties with other
                            countries to avoid double taxation and to promote administrative <pb

                            and collection of taxes. There are in effect at the present time six tax
                            conventions with four different countries—treaties dealing with income
                            taxes with Sweden, France, Canada, and the UK, and those covering death
                            taxes with Canada and UK. Treaties for the avoidance of double taxation
                            of income have been signed with Netherlands and Denmark, and approved,
                            with reservations, by the US Senate. They are now awaiting action by the
                            parliaments of the respective countries,<note n="1" xml:id="d221fn1">On
                                November 12, 1948, the Danish Parliament approved the double
                                taxation convention with the United States.</note> A treaty with
                            France, revising the income tax treaty of 1939, which will remain in
                            effect, and covering estate taxes in addition, has also been approved by
                            the US Senate, but similar action has not yet been taken by France. We
                            have arrived at various stages in the development of conventions with
                            South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium, Luxembourg, Mexico and Australia.
                            Negotiations with Italy, Greece, Norway, and Eire have been agreed upon
                            and are expected to start during late 1948 and 1949.</p>
                        <p>A convention for the avoidance of the double taxation of incomes by the
                            US and Union of South Africa was signed in December 1946, while one on
                            the double taxation of estates was signed by the two countries in April
                            1947. Both of these treaties, as well as a treaty with New Zealand, are
                            now pending before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                        <p>A draft income tax convention with Belgium, which was preliminarily
                            formulated in 1946, has now been finally agreed upon, and is expected to
                            be signed shortly. Final agreement is being sought on a similar
                            convention with Luxembourg and this agreement and the signing of the
                            convention, as well, are anticipated for the, near future. It is hoped
                            that both conventions will be signed in time for submittal early in the
                            first session of the eighty-first Congress.</p>
                        <p>Tax treaty negotiations with Mexico were carried through an advanced
                            drafting stage by mid-1947, since which time no further progress has
                            been made. Negotiations are again planned for early 1949 with the hope
                            that a convention can be concluded.</p>
                        <p>Discussions looking toward the negotiation of a tax treaty or treaties
                            between Australia and the US have been conducted by informal
                            correspondence between high tax officials of the two countries over a
                            considerable period of time. However, when the possibility of
                            negotiating such treaties was considered in the Australian cabinet the
                            latter, without quite closing the door, indicated that there was little
                            need or basis for a treaty on income taxes, but some possibility in
                            relation to estate taxes. The US reply to an Australian note outlining
                            this position urged that, while we could not state exactly what form the
                            conventions would <pb n="952" xml:id="pg_952" facs="0462"/>take nor what
                            items they might cover, a technical mission be authorized to discuss
                            both income and estate tax conventions.</p>
                        <p>A US mission has just departed for Rome and Athens to start negotiations
                            leading to the conclusion of tax conventions with Italy and Greece.
                            Discussions with Eire and Norway are expected to take place during the
                            early part of 1949.</p>
                        <p>Much consideration was given to tax conventions in preparing the agenda
                            for the Ninth International Conference of American States held at Bogotá
                            last spring. Circumstances prevented full discussion of this topic in
                            the conference, but an article in the Economic Agreement of Bogotá
                            provides that the member states shall negotiate conventions for the
                            avoidance of double taxation. The Economic Agreement has not yet been
                            ratified and put into effect, and discussions with individual countries
                            have not yet ripened into the negotiation stage, except in the case of
                            Mexico, cited above.</p>
                        <p>Income and estate tax conventions were being negotiated with the
                            Philippines in 1947, but no final agreement was reached at that time.
                            Negotiations have been suspended and it is not known whether they will
                            be resumed.</p>

                            <p>The foreign credit and investment policy of the Government of the
                                United States is an integral part of its foreign policy. Within the
                                framework of this foreign policy, it is designed to facilitate the
                                expansion of production and trade, to raise standards of living, and
                                to foster economic and social progress and development, thereby
                                promoting security, fundamental freedoms and peaceful conditions
                                through the world. This country’s desire to see a world trading
                                system established on a multi-lateral and nondiscriminatory basis
                                cannot easily be achieved without the flow of capital in adequate
                                amounts to foreign countries for economically desirable purposes.
                                United States foreign investment policy is supported by measures to
                                minimize barriers to international trade and to eliminate
                                discriminatory restrictions; thereon.<note n="4" xml:id="d222fn4">An

                            <p>It is the policy of this Government to maintain high and stable
                                levels of domestic economic activity through a comprehensive program
                                that takes into account both domestic and international
                                considerations. Thus, the Government regards it as desirable to
                                include foreign investment as one among several elements of economic
                                activity that should be timed with a view to mitigating economic
                                fluctuations, but only in so far as such timing is consistent with
                                other major domestic and international objectives.</p>
                            <p>In addition to its foreign loans and credits, the Government may make
                                grants under special programs where it seems desirable to assist
                                foreign countries without requiring repayment. This Statement,
                                however, does not deal with the subject of grants.<note n="5"

                                During the post-war period a large share of United States foreign
                                lending is, necessarily, to aid foreign countries in dealing with
                                the difficulties of the reconstruction period.<note n="6"

                            <p>This Government is concerned to see that adequate economic
                                justification exists for the particular purposes to be served by its
                                loans and credits and that the undertakings involved are adapted to
                                local conditions and can survive without permanent protection or
                                subsidy and without the exploitation of labor.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government regards it as desirable that foreign
                                investment be provided as far as possible by private capital or,
                                where private funds are not available on reasonable terms, by the
                                International <pb n="955" xml:id="pg_955" facs="0465"/>Bank for
                                Reconstruction and Development. During the next few years it is
                                likely that a substantial part of United States lending and
                                investment abroad will take the form of government credits notably
                                through the agency of the Export-Import Bank.<note n="7"

                                    activities.</note> It is the policy of the United States not to
                                compete with private lending or investing when private funds are
                                available on reasonable terms. The United States seeks maximum
                                private participation in its new and outstanding foreign loans. It
                                may also issue guaranties in connection with private foreign credits
                                and investments.</p>
                            <p>The United States regards the International Monetary Fund as the
                                appropriate agency to provide short-term financial aid where needed
                                to assist in maintaining exchange stability. In special cases, the
                                United States may, in harmony with the International Monetary Fund,
                                supplement the Fund through the United States Stabilization

                            <p>While it is not the policy of this Government to refuse credits to
                                countries simply on the ground that they are conducting state
                                enterprises or are pursuing nationalization programs, or on the
                                ground that the enterprises to be assisted are in greater or lesser
                                degree controlled by the foreign government, the treatment accorded
                                United States property owners by countries engaged in
                                nationalization programs is of concern to the United States-and is
                                taken into consideration when those countries seek loans from the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>The external debt record of the borrower is also taken into
                                consideration as an important factor in the determination of whether
                                a loan shall be extended. Appropriate allowance is made in cases
                                where a borrowing country has defaulted due to difficulties outside
                                its control and has taken such steps as it can toward a reasonable
                                settlement of the default.</p>
                            <p>The loans of the United States Government are not ordinarily
                                available to finance the acquisition either by government or private
                                enterprise of existing properties in foreign countries. In many
                                instances new enterprises will to some extent increase the
                                competition confronting existing firms, including United States
                                firms, whether the enterprises are financed by private or
                                governmental agencies. Careful consideration is given to these
                                competitive aspects. Where projects are economically justified,
                                however, it is not the policy of this Government to refuse credits
                                on the ground that competition confronting established enterprises
                                will be increased thereby.</p>
                            <p>It is also the general policy of the Government that its credits
                                should not strengthen or extend business arrangements or practices

                    <p>Civilian supplies included the value of incentive materials provided Germany
                        and Japan; civilian supplies furnished by the United States Army to occupied
                        areas (including Italy) to alleviate disease and unrest; and the issue of
                        supplies by the United States Navy in the Pacific Islands.</p>
                    <p>“Lend-lease” included only such aid as was furnished on a grant basis. Among
                        the programs included in the other grants category were aid in cultural and
                        economic programs for the American Republics; and financial aid provided to
                        China, Greece, Turkey, and to the Philippines. In general, grants were made
                        to rehabilitate national economies to the level of self-sufficiency for
                        minimum needs, whereas relief funds were expended to sustain life and to
                        prevent economic and physical retrogression.</p>

                        secret communication of December 11 (Reference <gloss target="#t_NOE1"
                            >NOE</gloss>) requesting the comment of the Department of the Interior
                        on a recommendation embodied in an enclosed memorandum as well as on the
                        problems related to the formulation of a new United States policy with
                        respect to Antarctica.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Under cover of identical
                            letters to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Interior (dated
                            December 11, 1947) and to the Secretaries of the Air Force and Commerce
                            (dated December 16, 1947), the Secretary of State transmitted copies of
                            a memorandum on proposed United States Antarctic policy. For text, see
                                <ref target="frus1947v01#pg_1055">

                    </p>
                    <p>This Department favors the proposal for the establishment of a common control
                        over Antarctica by the countries which in the past have been most actively
                        interested in Antarctica, such common control to take the form of a special
                        trusteeship arrangement. This position, of course assumes that under the
                        terms of the special trusteeship arrangement adequate provision will be made
                        for the conservation of mineral and biological resources and that the United
                        States will be assured of its fair and proportionate share of both the known
                        and the potential resources of Antarctica and its neighboring waters.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of a general United States policy with respect to Antarctica,
                        this Department is primarily concerned with the natural resources. In this
                        respect it is felt that the United States should assert its claims as
                        effectively as possible. Detailed comments on matters having to do with
                        minerals and mapping in the Antarctic will be submitted to you at a later
                        date.</p>

                    <p>The British Ambassador, Lord Inverchapel, came in to see me at 2:30 this
                        afternoon at his request.</p>
                    <p>Lord Inverchapel said that he had been instructed by his Government to
                        discuss with me the Antarctic situation. Lie said that the British
                        Government was concerned at the activities of the Chilean and Argentine
                        Governments in that area. In particular, he said the British Government was
                        concerned over the President of Chile having gone to one of the disputed
                        islands in the last few days and raised the Chilean flag.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d225fn2">In mid-February 1948, Chilean President Gabriel
                            Gonzalez Videla visited the South Shetland Islands and the Palmer
                            Peninsula of Antarctica and formally established bases there.</note> The
                        Ambassador also mentioned a press report to the effect that an Argentine
                        fleet was to be sent to the disputed area.<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">It
                            was subsequently announced that a task force of the Argentine fleet was
                            on maneuvers in Antarctic waters.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In all these circumstances the Ambassador said the British Government had
                        decided to send a British cruiser to the Falkland Islands and the Falkland
                        Islands dependencies.<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">On February 16 the British

                            Antarctic areas and the determination of the United Kingdom to resist
                            alleged “acts of trespass” against the Falkland Island Dependencies. For

                        discuss the whole matter informally with me and pointed out that the British
                        Government on security grounds attaches a considerable importance to this
                        matter. He showed me a map at this point and said that the British
                        Government feels that on strategic grounds it would not be desirable that
                        countries like Argentina and Chile, in the light of their record in World
                        War 2, control islands which could dominate the open water passage south of
                        Cape Horn.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the British Government had proposed to the Argentine
                        and Chilean Governments that the territorial claims <pb n="964"

                        referred to the Permanent Court of Justice for adjudication but that those

                    <p>Lord Inverchapel said that he had been instructed by his Government to ask me
                        the following questions: <list>

                            <item>Has the United States Government asserted claims to territory in
                                the Antarctic and if not, does it intend to do so? I asked Mr.
                                Hickerson if he could answer this question and he replied that the
                                United States has not itself asserted claims to territory in the
                                Antarctic nor has it recognized the claims of any other countries in
                                that area. Mr. Hickerson added that the United States Government
                                would like to see some satisfactory international solution of this
                                matter but failing this, the United States Government will probably
                                feel compelled to assert territorial claims in the Antarctic.</item>

                                    countries were prepared to support a resolution at the
                                    forthcoming Bogotá Conference declaring all colonial possessions

                                    security of the Hemisphere. Lord Inverchapel expressed the hope
                                    that the United States Government would be able to persuade the
                                    deletion of such a resolution from the agenda of the Conference
                                    or would otherwise find some way to neutralize efforts to

                                satisfactorily by intergovernmental negotiations between the
                                interested governments and that a Conference, if called, should be a
                                culmination of such negotiations, its function being to formalize an
                                agreement already reached.</item>

                            <item>The Ambassador inquired whether in view of the strategic
                                importance of this area the United States would be agreeable to an
                                exchange of views with the United Kingdom Government. I stated that
                                    <pb n="965" xml:id="pg_965" facs="0475"/>our officers had been
                                studying the Antarctic problem for some time and that we hoped in
                                the near future to be in a position to discuss it in greater detail
                                with the British Government. We have noted the British objection to
                                a trusteeship arrangement directly under the United Nations and we
                                are thinking also of possible alternatives. We recognized the
                                importance of exchanging views with the British on the basic
                                approach to this problem but we will have to be very circumspect and
                                avoid possible criticism from other Governments in view of the
                                claims of Argentina, Chile, Australia and New Zealand in this area.
                                In these circumstances I said that I thought that the Ambassador
                                would probably agree that it might well be desirable to open
                                discussions with the other countries concerned at the time detailed
                                discussions are taken up with the British.</item>

                                idea for one or two of the officers of his Embassy to talk these
                                matters over quietly with officers of the Department of State. I
                                told him that I would consider this matter and let him know later
                                but that it would probably be arrangeable.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>I told Lord Inverchapel that speaking off the record, I had been somewhat
                        puzzled at the action of the British Government in sending a cruiser to the
                        area and that I had been wondering just what the cruiser would do when it
                        got there. In view of spectacular action, of Chilean President and dramatic
                        departure of so-called Argentine fleet, I wondered if the British cruiser
                        decision did not put them in an undignified position. I stressed the fact
                        that in saying this I was speaking entirely as an individual and not as
                        Secretary of State.</p>

                            appearing to advance the claims on any one party in a territorial
                            dispute, would prejudice the opportunity for its equitable and peaceful
                            solution in accordance with international law. For an account of the

                        Minister Bramuglia told us yesterday Argentina would have to bring up at

                        Falkland Islands. We explained Department’s position and Bramuglia said it
                        was what he expected Bramuglia said Argentine claim Falkland Islands
                        perfectly valid; British have no reason other than pride for wanting
                        islands; costing British money and British unable defend them. Bramuglia
                        said he and Perón<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">Juan Domingo Perón, President
                            of Argentina.</note> convinced war with Russia probably near future
                        inevitable and Argentine possession Falkland Islands indispensable since
                        Argentina would join with the United States on first day of war and
                        Falklands would be only base on which Russia could direct operations against
                        Argentina, one of food supplying centers world. He said Argentina considers
                        Falkland question entirely separate Antarctic region; Argentina is prepared
                        argue Antarctic question but matter real importance is Falkland Islands. He
                        assumed relations England-Argentina would not reach state violence but
                        emphasized Argentine determination. Bramuglia dwelt considerable length on
                        his hope United States would give Argentina some support. Remarked England

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I have your letter of
                        March 8, 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d228fn1">Not printed.</note> concerning
                        the problems connected with the situation in Antarctica. I have noted the
                        points raised in your letter.</p>
                    <p>There are two aspects of the situation which in our opinion ought to take
                        precedence at present. First, while we recognize that the United Kingdom and
                        the United States share important interests in Antarctica, we feel that we
                        should approach the other interested countries in the very near future in
                        order to give due weight to their interests in the discussion and working
                        out of a jointly satisfactory solution. Second, we feel that it will be
                        advantageous to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the countries of
                        the Western Hemisphere to have initiated discussions looking toward a
                        settlement prior to the opening of the Bogotá Conference at the end of this
                        month.</p>
                    <p>I feel sure that you will agree as to the importance of both of these aspects
                        of the problem, and I hope that your Government will find it possible to
                        agree to survey with us the possibilities of working out a jointly
                        satisfactory agreement for some form of international administration. In
                        suggesting this, I do not overlook the existence of real problems which
                        would have to be worked out.</p>
                    <p>Although I am unable now to comply with your request for a rough outline of
                        our proposals in writing, we would welcome an opportunity for an officer or
                        officers of your Embassy to meet again at their early convenience with the
                        appropriate officers of the Department of State to obtain further background
                        on our thinking.</p>

                    <p>As background, the Chilean Ambassador had requested an appointment with the
                        Secretary of State on March 9 to discuss the Chilean position concerning
                        Antarctica. The appointment was made but the Chilean Ambassador was not able
                        to keep the engagement because he was ill for about ten days. When he again
                        sought an appointment, a few days before the Bogotá Conference, the
                        Secretary of State asked Mr. Armour to go to the Chilean Embassy to see the
                        Chilean Ambassador to satisfy the need for a discussion on the subject and
                        to show courtesy to the Chilean Ambassador since it was impossible for the
                        Secretary of State to see him because of the pressure of business. (After
                        Mr. Armour’s interview, a telegram<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">Telegram 104,
                            March 27, to Santiago, not printed (800.014 Antarctic/3–2748).</note>
                        explaining the circumstances was despatched to the Embassy at Santiago in
                        order that the Chilean Government might know that the Department of State
                        has full respect for the Chilean Ambassador.)</p>
                    <p>The Chilean Ambassador said that his Government felt the “armed threat”
                        carried out by the British in sending the Cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                            >Nigeria</hi> to the Antarctic islands was sufficient basis for
                        appealing for inter-American collaboration under the Rio Treaty. He said
                        that the Chilean Government had come to an agreement on March 7, 1948 with
                        the Argentine Government that the two Governments would maintain a “united
                        frontier” [“<hi rend="italic">united front</hi>”?] on matters pertaining to
                        the disputed claims in the Antarctic area,<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">The
                            reference here is presumably to the Argentine-Chilean agreement of March
                            4, 1948; the text of that agreement is printed in Carlyle, <hi
                                rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs</hi>, p.
                            815.</note> and he said that the Chilean Delegation at the Bogotá
                        Conference would request a declaration by the Conference that the Rio Treaty
                        is applicable in instances such as the “armed threat” he had mentioned.</p>
                    <p>In the course of further conversation with the Chilean Ambassador, it
                        appeared to be the consensus that the question of whether reciprocal
                        assistance could be appropriately requested concerning “armed threats” or
                        “gestures of force” to support the claims of one party in a disputed area
                        was not clearly answered in the Rio Treaty. While it is true that the
                        Delegation of the United States had made a “statement” at the Rio Conference
                        recording its position “… the Treaty of Rio <pb n="971" xml:id="pg_971"
                            facs="0481"/>de Janeiro has no effect upon the sovereignty, national or
                        international status of any of the territories included in the region
                        defined in Article 4 of the Treaty”, there seems to be a gap in the existing
                        Treaty structure so far as concerned the question set forth in the preceding
                        sentence. The Chilean Ambassador appeared to agree tacitly that it would be
                        difficult to interpret the Rio Treaty so that it would apply in such
                        cases.</p>
                    <p>It was intimated to the Chilean Ambassador that the British Government might
                        be disposed to offer to discuss with the Chilean and Argentine Governments
                        the whole question of disputed claims in the Antarctic islands, and it was
                        pointed out that if such a discussion were to appear imminent there would be
                        no reason for bringing up the question of applicability of the Rio Treaty at
                        the Bogotá Conference. The Chilean Ambassador said that he would appreciate
                        receiving information when the Department of State may have anything more
                        concrete to indicate the possibility of the British disposition to enter
                        into such discussions.</p>

                            State transmitted a rough working draft of a possible condominium
                            agreement for Antarctica. The concluding paragraph of the Secretary of
                            State’s letter read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is desirable that the Department of State be in a position to
                                    discuss with the other Governments concerned (Britain, Norway,
                                    France, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Chile) the
                                    establishment of either a condominum or a trusteeship
                                    arrangement, whichever may upon full exchange of views prove
                                    preferable. It is expected that the problem of Antarctica will
                                    be raised in a difficult and possibly embarrassing manner in the
                                    Bogotá Conference at the end of March. The handling of the
                                    situation in Bogotá would be materially easier if prior to the
                                    conference we open discussion of the matter with the other
                                    Governments. I should therefore appreciate it if I could receive
                                    an indication, that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have no objection
                                    to our attempting to settle the problem on the basis of either a
                                    trusteeship or condominium, whichever may be decided to offer
                                    the more practical solution.” (800.014 Antarctic/1–2348)</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the matter from a military point of
                        view and are of the opinion that the Antarctic is of little apparent
                        strategic value to the United States now. They add, however, that its future
                        strategic value (including natural resources) to the <pb n="972"
                            xml:id="pg_972" facs="0482"/>United States or to our most probable
                        enemies cannot be accurately predicted at this time in view of the dearth of
                        information concerning this region and in view of possible long-term
                        scientific developments. The present limited knowledge of the area indicates
                        that the chief value of the Antarctic is in scientific and meteorological
                        fields, both of which have very great military import now and might become
                        critical in the future.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, and from a military standpoint, two factors appear
                        to be of paramount importance in determining United States policy with
                        respect to the Antarctic.</p>
                    <p>First, because of the proximity to the Antarctic of Argentina, Chile,
                        Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, all potential allies of the United
                        States in event of war, this region might be of considerable strategic value
                        to our enemy should a major conflict occur. Specifically, enemy control in
                        the area adjacent to South America could have very serious consequences if
                        use of the Panama Canal were denied the United States, leaving the passage
                        around Cape Horn as the shortest sea route between the east and west coasts
                        of the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, it is imperative that sovereignty or
                        active participation in control of the Antarctic, under trusteeship
                        arrangement or otherwise, should be denied groups of nations which include
                        our most probable enemies, and United States policy with respect to the
                        disposition of this problem should be pointed toward this objective. Second,
                        it is important that in the determination of our Antarctic policy, we should
                        make certain that our possible future Arctic interests are in no wise
                        weakened by any precedents established with respect to the Antarctic.
                        Although no land has been discovered nearer to the North Pole than northern
                        Greenland by any polar expedition nor by numerous recent Air Force polar
                        flights, the possibility remains that there may be undiscovered land in the
                        Arctic area. Such land, even if relatively minor in size, could well be of
                        great strategic importance.</p>
                    <p>For the above reasons, in the interests of national security, United States
                        claims or potential claims in the Antarctic should be relinquished only if
                        and when this course should be justified by future determination that the
                        Antarctic area has no strategic value to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Your several letters suggest various possible alternatives for disposing of
                        the Antarctic question—(1) the establishment of a special trusteeship; (2)
                        the conclusion of a condominium agreement of the interested states; or (3)
                        the presentation of United States claims, followed by the submission of the
                        entire problem for judicial settlement. Each of these alternatives has been
                        considered from the standpoint of the considerations described in the
                        preceding paragraphs.</p>
                    <pb n="973" xml:id="pg_973" facs="0483"/>
                    <p>In our opinion it would appear impracticable, or in any event difficult, to
                        guarantee against the active participation of our most probable enemies in
                        the control of the Antarctic if trusteeship arrangements should be carried
                        through to completion. For this reason we do not favor this alternative.</p>
                    <p>The advisability or inadvisability of a condominium appears less clear. The
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the view that while a condominium, as such,
                        would not finally resolve the matter of individual claims to the areas of
                        the Antarctic, its practical effect might be to protect the over-all
                        interests of the United States in that region provided that (<hi
                            rend="italic">a</hi>) the condominium agreement would not in any way be
                        regarded as a precedent for any United States Arctic policy that might
                        prejudice our possible future Arctic interests, and (<hi rend="italic"
                            >b</hi>) no nation included among our most probable enemies would be a
                        party to such a condominium. Our misgivings as to this course arise from our
                        doubts as to whether, for the reason hereinafter stated, this second
                        safeguard can in fact be provided.</p>
                    <p>It is our understanding that a condominium involves a pooling of otherwise
                        conflicting claims to sovereignty, thus establishing among the claimants a
                        tacit recognition of the validity of each others’ claims without recourse to
                        a judicial determination. If this understanding is correct, and if the
                        Soviet Union should assert claims to Peter I Island and Alexander I Land, it
                        might be difficult to maintain that such claims, no matter how invalid we
                        might consider them, were not a justification, equal to that represented by
                        the claims of other nations, for Soviet participation in the condominium. If
                        this contingency could be guarded against, there would be no objection to a
                        condominium agreement along the lines of the draft which you have submitted,
                        provided, however, that the wording of Article VI is retained and the
                        wording in alternate Article VI is deleted.<note n="4" xml:id="d232fn4"
                            >Article VI of the rough working draft of an Antarctic condominium
                            agreement, transmitted under cover of the Secretary of State’s letter of
                            March 16, read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The parties hereto may, with the approval of the Commission [the

                                    from time to time may be necessary for the defense of the area
                                    and for the maintenance of international peace and
                                    security.”</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>Alternate Article VI read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The parties hereto agree that no military establishments or
                                        fortifications shall be established within the area, and
                                        that it shall be maintained as a demilitarized area.”</p>
                                </quote>
                            </p>
                        </note> It would not be in the military interest for Antarctica to be
                        maintained as a demilitarized area. If the foregoing contingency cannot be
                        guarded against, then the proposed condominium would appear to have no
                        advantages, from a military standpoint, over the trusteeship solution.</p>

                    <p>In view of the difficulties which we perceive in the two foregoing
                        alternatives, it is our view that the preferable course at the present time
                        from a military standpoint, would be to press United States claims to areas
                        of Antarctica and to propose submission of the entire problem of Antarctica
                        to judicial determination. This assumes, of course, that the State
                        Department considers it essential to reach some solution to the problem of
                        Antarctica at this time. If this assumption is not correct, we would suggest
                        additional study of this matter by our several agencies and its submission
                        to <gloss target="#t_SANACC1">SANACC</gloss> for joint consideration.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Archie</hi>: As your letter of March 24, 1948 to
                        Lew Douglas<note n="1" xml:id="d233fn1">Not printed.</note> arrived on the
                        eve of his departure, he turned it over to me for reply. I believe that the
                        talk on Antarctica which our people had with officers of your Embassy late
                        in the afternoon of March 24 served to clarify the points raised in your
                        letter. The following may, however, be useful.</p>
                    <p>As a result of our conversations with officers of your Embassy last
                            week,<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">See telegram 1059, March 25, to
                            London, <ref target="#pg_969">p. 969</ref>.</note> we have decided to
                        postone any approach to the other interested countries until we have had
                        opportunity to study the question further. It was agreed, on your side, that
                        no action would foe taken for the present to issue invitations to a
                        four-country round table concerning the area of the British Antarctic claim.
                        I may note, in further clarification of our position, that our approach to
                        the other countries did not contemplate a conference, but only exploratory
                        diplomatic conversations.</p>
                    <p>The Department shares your view that no occasion should be given to the
                        Soviet Union to participate in an Antarctic settlement or administration,
                        and would not propose or accept any arrangement to the contrary. We feel,
                        however, that the eminent, very extensive, and long-continued activities of
                        official and private American parties in Antarctica places the United States
                        in a wholly different status from any which could be successfully claimed by
                        the Soviet Union on the basis of Russian activities of 127 years ago.</p>
                    <p>We shall hope in the near future to foe in touch with your Embassy again on
                        this subject.</p>

                    <p>2. Mr. Thompson (<gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>) argued that since the
                        British had expressed a desire to negotiate with Argentina and Chile with a
                        view to settling their dispute with these countries regarding the Falkland
                        Island Dependencies, our Government should take no further steps toward a
                        general discussion pending the outcome of these negotiations. <gloss
                            target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> pointed out that in view of the rancors
                        developed during the past navigation season between the British on the one
                        hand, and the Chileans and Argentines on the other, rancors which would in
                        all probability be revived and perhaps accentuated in the coming navigation
                        season and which would embarrass this Government, more positive action by
                        the United States is needed. <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> supported
                        this view.</p>
                    <p>3. Discussion resulted in agreement that this Government propose to London
                        that an international regime, affiliated with the United Nations, but not a
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship, be established for the
                        Antarctic continent, disposition of the disputed islands (South Shetland,
                        South Orkney and South Sandwich groups, and South Georgia) to be attempted
                        by the British in negotiation with Chile and Argentina. Mr. Morrison (<gloss
                            target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>), in consultation with Mr. Boggs and <gloss
                            target="#t_UNA1">UNA</gloss>, was instructed to draw up a draft
                        agreement for an international regime for submission to London. Mr. Thompson
                        urged that in view of the difficulties which had attended discussions with
                        Mr. Hadow of the British Embassy here, an officer be sent to London to carry
                        on preliminary negotiations.</p>
                    <p>4. It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> be informed of
                        the nature of the proposals which the Department proposes to make to the
                        London Foreign Office and that <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> be
                        requested to advise the Department whether these proposals give proper
                        protection to U.S. security interests.</p>

                    <p>A draft paper dated May 25, 1948, and entitled “Recommendations Concerning
                        United States Policy Regarding Antarctica and Actions for Its
                        Implementation”, together with a draft text of a trusteeship agreement for
                        Antarctica and a draft letter from the Secretary of <pb n="977"
                            xml:id="pg_977" facs="0487"/>State to the Secretary of Defense, were
                        circulated in the Department of State under cover of a memorandum of May 27
                        by George H. Butler of the Policy Planning Staff. Butler’s memorandum
                        explained that the draft paper, agreement and letter had been prepared by a
                        working group composed of representatives of the Office of European Affairs,
                        the Office of American Republic Affairs, the Division of Dependent Area
                        Affairs, the Office of the Legal Adviser, and the Policy Planning Staff. The
                        working group had taken into consideration the views expressed at the Policy
                        Planning Staff meeting of April 21 (see <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>) and
                        also the views of two American Antarctic explorers, Commander Finn Ronne and
                        Dr. Paul Siple (800.014 Antarctic/5–2748). A memorandum by the Policy
                        Planning Staff, dated June 2, observed that a number of changes had been
                        made in the various draft papers as a result of a meeting on May 30 between
                        the Policy Planning Staff and representatives of various Department offices
                        and divisions (800.014 Antarctic/6–248). A further meeting was held on June
                        2 at which time additional revisions were recommended (Policy Planning Staff
                        files, Lot 64 D 563). For the final version of the paper and draft

                            Secretary of Defense Forrestal under cover of a brief letter. In his
                            letter Secretary Marshall observed that unless there was an objection to
                            the paper on military grounds, the Department of State proposed to
                            proceed at once with its implementation. Should there be an objection by
                            the Military Establishment, the Secretary of State was prepared to
                            submit the paper to the National Security Council for study and decision

                    <p>1. Nationals of several states have made discoveries, conducted explorations,
                        established temporary and semipermanent bases, and made territorial claims
                        for their respective countries in the Antarctic region. U.S. nationals
                        acting privately or on behalf of the U.S. Government have played a leading
                        role in these activities.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States Government has refrained from asserting any official
                        territorial claim in the antarctic region. However, it has refused to
                        recognize the claims of other countries and has reserved its own rights.</p>
                    <p>3. Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Norway and France
                        all have made official claims of sovereignty over specific islands in the
                        Antarctic region and over segments of the Antarctic Continent. Certain of
                        these claims are in dispute. The Argentine claim overlaps almost entirely
                        the British Falkland Islands Dependencies claim. The Chilean claim conflicts
                        with Both British and Argentine claims to the Palmer Peninsula and Shetland
                        Islands. The conflicting claims have produced tension in the relations
                        between Great Britain on the one hand and Argentina and Chile on the other,
                        which have led to the dispatch of armed vessels to the territories in
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>4. No nation has laid official claim to the large sector of Antarctica lying
                        between 90° West Longitude and 150° West Longitude. However, the
                        discoveries, explorations and claims of Byrd and Ellsworth in this area
                        would justify a U.S. official claim to all of it, a claim unlikely to be
                        contested by other governments.</p>
                    <p>5. In addition to the sector between 90° West Longitude and 150° West
                        Longitude, the U.S. Government would have good grounds for claiming other
                        areas discovered, explored and claimed for the United States by U.S.
                        nationals but which are claimed by the governments of other powers in spite
                        of the fact that in some cases these areas have not been seen by the
                        nationals of the claiming power.</p>
                    <p>6. Control of territory in the Antarctic region is not considered essential
                        to the security of the United States. <list>

                                strategic concern to the United States is the Drake Passage between
                                Tierra del Fuego on the north and the South Shetland group of
                                islands on the south. In the event of the closing of the Panama
                                Canal, this passage would become an important sea route and hostile
                                naval or air units based on either side of it could interfere with
                                the passage of U.S. naval or commercial shipping.…</item>

                    <p>7. Since the Antarctic Continent is almost entirely covered by a thick ice
                        sheet and since the sub-Antarctic islands have no significant resources, the
                        economic value of the Antarctic region lies chiefly in its marine life,
                        primarily whales. Whaling operations are now for the most part based on
                        factory ships and hence do not require land bases in the Antarctic. The land
                        areas of the Antarctic region are therefore not at present of economic
                        interest to the U.S. nor are they likely to be in the future.</p>
                    <p>8. Antarctic waters provide the United States Navy with opportunity for
                        gaining experience in ice operations and for testing equipment under severe
                        conditions without attracting the kind of attention which would be likely to
                        attend similar operations in the Arctic, However, no land bases in
                        Antarctica are needed for such operations.</p>
                    <p>9. The interest of U.S. private and Government-sponsored expeditions has been
                        primarily scientific—to extend knowledge of the Antarctic and its
                        phenomena.</p>
                    <p>10. The dispute between Great Britain on the one side and Argentina and Chile
                        on the other over conflicting claims in the Antarctic, while almost entirely
                        a matter of prestige, is a source of embarrassment to the United States
                        because of our close relation to Great Britain and our commitments in the
                        Western Hemisphere, This embarrassment is susceptible of exploitation by the
                        USSR to the further disadvantage of the United States. Our national interest
                        therefore requires that a settlement of this dispute be reached which will
                        be acceptable to the three countries involved.</p>
                    <p>11. An international administration for the Antarctic Continent and
                        sub-Antarctic islands would best promote the further scientific exploration
                        and investigation of Antarctic phenomena. Such an administration would also
                        facilitate the correlation of meteorological observations which are of
                        practical significance in making long range weather forecasts for Australia,
                        New Zealand, South Africa, and southern South America. Extended observations
                        may also confirm the belief that meteorological conditions in the Antarctic
                        region affect weather even further to the north.</p>
                    <p>12. An international administration would also provide a solution to the
                        dispute between Great Britain, Argentina and Chile. A surrender of
                        sovereignty claims by all three disputants which did not give an advantage
                        to any one of them would cause no loss of prestige.</p>
                    <p>13. Although U.S. economic interests in the Antarctic region are negligible,
                        the possible strategic significance of the Drake Passage, the large
                        expenditure of U.S. private and public funds in Antarctic exploration, and
                        American popular interest in the region require that the U.S. have a voice
                        in any international administration that may be established.</p>
                    <pb n="980" xml:id="pg_980" facs="0490"/>
                    <p>14. So long as the U.S. has made no official claims to Antarctic territory,
                        it would have to base a claim for participation in an international
                        administration exclusively on the discoveries and explorations of its
                        nationals. While no other country has contributed as much to the discovery
                        and exploration of Antarctica, as has the United States, international law
                        regarding sovereignty over uninhabited areas is so vague that other
                        countries as yet having no official territorial claims, but whose citizens
                        have also made discoveries and conducted explorations, could likewise claim
                        participation in an international administration.</p>
                    <p>15. The USSR probably would not make claims on the grounds of discoveries
                        made by the Imperial Russian Expedition of 1819–1820 under von
                        Bellingshausen. A territorial claim by the Russians on the basis of prior
                        discovery would leave them open to similar claims by other countries to
                        islands in the Arctic which the Russians consider Soviet territory. And
                        participation in an international control over Antarctica would leave them
                        open to demands for a similar regime in the Arctic which would be entirely
                        contrary to their long maintained sector principle of sovereignty in that
                        area. However, there is nothing to prevent the Russians from sending an
                        expedition to the unclaimed sector of the Antarctic continent between 90°
                        and 150° West Longitude, establishing a permanent base there, conducting
                        explorations and laying official claim to territory on the basis of these
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>16. Making official United States claim, on the basis of discovery and
                        exploration by American citizens, to the unclaimed sector is thus
                        desirable-on two grounds: (1) to forestall any Soviet attempt to become a
                        territorial claimant by activities in this sector, and (2) prevent the USSR
                        and other non-claimant powers from claiming a right to participate in
                        discussions for an international regime on the ground that the U.S. is not a
                        claimant power.</p>
                    <p>17. Such action on our part would also serve to safeguard our position and
                        rights should the proposal for internationalization prove unacceptable to
                        the other countries concerned. It is with that possibility in mind that we
                        should claim all areas in Antarctica to which we have the best right by
                        virtue of discovery and exploration on the part of our nationals, even
                        though some of the areas thus claimed are also claimed by other powers.</p>
                    <p>18. The continuation of the present situation with annual recurrences of
                        tension would perhaps best suit the USSR. The friction and contention
                        attendant upon an effort to partition Antarctica among the various claimants
                        by the long and uncertain process of court settlement would likewise serve
                        their purposes well. An international arrangement not connected with the
                        United Nations would give them factual grounds for a charge (which would be
                        heard sympathetically by some <pb n="981" xml:id="pg_981" facs="0491"
                        />nations outside the Soviet orbit) that the United States and the other
                        nations concerned were by-passing and weakening the United Nations. It is
                        important to our general international position that we maintain our full
                        support of the United Nations and that any onus of weakening and disrupting
                        the United Nations remain exclusively upon the USSR. Although the Soviet
                        Union and its satellites could enter an objection to any agreement for
                        internationalizing Antarctica which is submitted to the United Nations for
                        approval and could subject the administration set up under it to annual
                        criticism, such action on the part of the Soviet Union or its satellites
                        would be generally recognized for what it was, a mere attempt to cause
                        friction.</p>
                    <p>19. While the trusteeship system of the United Nations was established
                        primarily “for the development of peoples, not penguins”, there is nothing
                        in the Charter excluding the application of a trusteeship to uninhabited
                        areas. In fact the establishment of a trusteeship over Antarctica would
                        appear to be justified by the first of the four basic objectives of the
                        system as stated under Article 76, viz., “to further international peace and
                        security”. While it seems unlikely that war could break out over disputed
                        claims in Antarctica, it cannot be denied that wars in the past have grown
                        out of disputes of even more trivial nature.</p>
                    <p>20. In view of the number of claimant powers and the strong position taken by
                        some of them, a trusteeship would have to be of a joint nature under the
                        authority of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Trusteeship Council.
                        While a joint trusteeship would present serious administrative problems in
                        areas with permanent indigenous populations or significant exploitable
                        economic resources, the absence of these in Antarctica should simplify
                        matters. The fact that primary interest in the region, aside from national
                        prestige, is scientific, suggests that the administration of the trusteeship
                        should have to do primarily with coordinating scientific investigations, the
                        maintenance and operation of permanent scientific stations, certifying
                        expeditions and the like. Since scientists in general subscribe to the
                        doctrine that “science knows no boundaries”, and since the bulk of the
                        “population” in Antarctica at any one time would be composed of members of
                        scientific expeditions or stations, national frictions should be reduced to
                        a minimum.</p>
                    <p>21. Since a principal scientific interest in the Antarctic region is
                        meteorological observation for the purpose of making long range weather
                        forecasts for the Southern Hemisphere, and since meteorological stations on
                        certain uninhabited islands not included in the Antarctic region as here
                        defined would improve the accuracy of such forecasts, the proposed
                        international administration should be empowered to accept these islands
                        from the owning states if the latter wish to assign them.</p>
                    <pb n="982" xml:id="pg_982" facs="0492"/>
                    <p>22. It may be desirable at some future time to admit to participation in the
                        international administration of Antarctica other nations which may have a
                        legitimate interest in that area and which may be able to make a significant
                        contribution to scientific developments in that area. Thus, although the
                        Union of South Africa has carried on no explorations in Antarctica and has
                        made no claims to territory in that region, its ports have served as bases
                        for operations in Antarctic waters and it claims certain islands in
                        sub-Antarctic waters which it might be desirable to include in the area
                        under international administration in order to better coordinate
                        meteorological observations and improve long range weather forecasts for the
                        Southern Hemisphere. Because of its geographical position in the Southern
                        Hemisphere, the Union is likely to have an interest in such forecasts.
                        However, any provision for subsequent admission to the international regime
                        of states not participating in the original convention should be so worded
                        as to exclude the possibility of admitting the Soviet Union or any of the
                        states in its orbit.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">recommendations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>1. It is recommended that the United States support in principle the
                        establishment of an international status for Antarctica, in the form of a
                        United Nations trusteeship or in other suitable form, the terms of which
                        should be agreed on by the United States, Great Britain, Australia, New
                        Zealand, Argentina, Chile, France, and Norway before submission to the
                        United Nations General Assembly for approval. A trusteeship would be
                        administered by the above powers. A draft for a trusteeship agreement, to be
                        submitted to the other seven powers as a basis for discussion, is attached
                        hereto.</p>
                    <p>2. The United States should at an appropriate time make official claim to
                        areas in Antarctica to which it has the best rights by virtue of discovery
                        and exploration on the part of its nationals. This action is necessary in
                        order to place the United States on an equal footing with the other seven
                        powers, all of which have made official claims to Antarctic territory. A
                        geographic definition of the areas to be claimed by the United States will
                        be provided by Mr. Boggs, R/GE.</p>
                    <p>The announcement of United States claims should not be made until after
                        agreement to negotiate an international settlement has been obtained from
                        the other seven powers and it should be explained to these powers, prior to
                        the announcement of our claims, that they are being made in order to place
                        the United States on an equal juridical footing with them and that they
                        would be suspended on the coming into effect of a satisfactory international
                        statute.</p>
                    <p>3. It is recommended that the proposed international area include the
                        Antarctic Continent and all islands south of 60° South Latitude except, at
                        least initially, the South Shetland and South Orkney groups <pb n="983"
                            xml:id="pg_983" facs="0493"/>regarding which the British believe they
                        may be able to work out a settlement with Argentina and Chile. (The British,
                        and possibly also Argentina and Chile, might be-informed during the
                        preliminary negotiations looking toward the setting up of an international
                        area that in the event of their failure to reach a satisfactory settlement
                        regarding the South Shetlands and the South Orkneys, we would favor their
                        inclusion in the international area.)</p>
                    <p>4. Our proposal for establishing an international area should be presented to
                        the British, Australian, New Zealand, Norwegian, French, Argentine and
                        Chilean Governments. In view of discussions already held with the British,
                        it is recommended that the British representative here be informed of our
                        proposals before they are submitted to the representatives of the other
                        powers. It is also recommended that, in compliance with our commitment to
                        the Chilean Government, a competent representative of the Department be sent
                        to Santiago to present our proposals and discuss them in detail with the
                        appropriate Chilean authorities. The same repesentative of the Department
                        might well proceed also to Buenos Aires for a similar purpose.</p>
                    <p>5. Upon the attainment of substantial agreement through diplomatic
                        conversations, a conference should be convoked to put the agreement in final
                        form and to formalize it. (The locus of the conference may be left for
                        decision on the basis of developments as negotiations proceed.)</p>
                    <p>6. Every effort should be made to secure substantial agreement in diplomatic
                        negotiations, if not the signing of a convention, before the beginning of
                        the next navigation season in Antarctic waters.</p>
                    <p>7. The convention should be ratified as promptly as possible by the
                        governments of the several countries and submitted to the General Assembly
                        of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>8. It is recommended that responsibility for handling this matter on the
                        operational level be assigned to ——— (to be named by the Under Secretary)
                        who will be assisted, in the capacity of Executive Secretary, by Mr. Caspar
                        Green of <gloss target="#t_NOE1">NOE</gloss>. Mr. ——— should be at liberty
                        to draw on the interested offices of the Department for assistance and
                        advice, but he should have the power, at his own discretion, to make
                        decisions which arise currently in the process of consultations and
                        negotiations, subject to the final authority of the Secretary in matters of
                        particular importance.</p>
                    <p>It will be understood that the recommendations set forth above represent only
                        an initial indication of the direction in which the Department should
                        endeavor to make progress. They will naturally be subject to modification in
                        the light of the views of other nations. However, no decision should be
                        taken which would represent a fundamental departure from this pattern,
                        unless the matter has been re-examined as a long-term policy question.</p>

                <p>The following considerations, in briefest outline, have led us to the conclusion
                    that the establishment of an international status for the Antarctic area is the
                    most practicable and preferable method of solving <pb n="988" xml:id="pg_988"
                        facs="0498"/>the problem of conflicting and potentially conflicting claims
                    in that area.</p>
                <p>In view of the engagement in the area of the prestige of various nations; in view
                    of the very difficult problems which would be posed, should a division among the
                    various national sovereignties be sought through the International Court; in
                    view of the fact that the foreseeable values of Antarctica are scientific rather
                    than strategic or economic; and because an international regime would be well
                    calculated to promote the exploitation of these scientific values:
                    internationalization appears to present the best possibility of removing the
                    area from the field of present or potential future contention, at the same, time
                    preserving to the most interested nations control over the strategic use and
                    possible economic value of the area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Strategic Significance</hi>. Strategic interest in the area
                    centers on the Drake Passage between Tierra del Fuego on the north and the South
                    Shetland Islands on the south. In the event of the closing of the Panama Canal,
                    this Passage would become an important sea route and hostile naval or air units
                    based on either side of it could interfere with passage of naval or commercial
                    shipping. Chile and Argentina are the recognized sovereigns over Tierra del
                    Fuego and islands adjacent thereto. Whatever the attitude of Argentina and Chile
                    under war conditions, it is hardly likely that they would voluntarily give up
                    control of their territories to the north of the Drake Passage. Exclusive
                    control of the Drake Passage by Argentina and/or Chile would be prevented if
                    Great Britain, Argentina and Chile share control of the South Shetland Islands
                    or, preferably, if those islands were made part of an international area
                    administered jointly by the several interested powers, including the United
                    States and Great Britain. It will be noted that under the proposal, no
                    additional nations could be included without the consent of all the original
                    signatories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Need for a Settlement</hi>. The conflict of interests, the
                    friction and disagreement generated by the conflict of claims, and the unsettled
                    status of Antarctica perturbs otherwise amicable relations and is susceptible of
                    exploitation by the USSR to the disadvantage of the interested nations.</p>

                    for the Antarctic continent and sub-Antarctic islands would promote the further

                    would facilitate the correlation of meteorological observations of practical
                    significance in long range weather forecast, particularly for countries of the
                    Southern Hemisphere.</p>

                    similarly to other interested countries in ten days or two weeks. Following
                    points made in conversation: Our approach will be to present proposal as basis
                    for discussion and negotiation. Brit attitude as expressed previously has been
                    taken into account. Our proposal calculated to prevent Sov intervention in
                    process of settlement or interference with resulting status. South Shetland and
                    South Orkney Island groups omitted from draft for proposed trust area on
                    understanding Brit prefer attempting work out settlement with Arg and Chile. We
                    hope amicable tripartite negotiations will be underway before next navigation
                    season. On principle we would prefer inclusion of these Islands in trust area
                    and we reserve our position for review in light Chilean and Arg positions on
                    this question. Implication draft proposal that US will become claimant power was
                    confirmed. Explanation made that once negotiations started US expects to
                    announce claims for purpose of leaving no part of area unclaimed, putting US on
                    equal legal basis with other negotiating countries, and safeguarding US national
                    interest.</p>
                <p>Hope was expressed that Brit will accept proposal as basis for discussion and
                    that they will appreciate our obligation to approach other interested

                    enclose a copy of their comments.</p>
                <p>My earlier letter<note n="3" xml:id="d240fn3">Secretary Forrestal’s letter of

                    was addressed to the question of whether, from a military standpoint, it was
                    preferable to seek a solution to the problem of Antarctica through (1) the
                    establishment of a trusteeship, (2) the conclusion of a condominium agreement,
                    or (3) juridical settlement. I there expressed the view that the assertion of
                    American claims, followed by the submission of the entire question to an
                    international tribunal, appeared to be the course which was best adapted to
                    accommodate military requirements. This conclusion was founded on our doubts as
                    to whether it would be possible, in establishing either condominium or
                    trusteeship, to meet the following two conditions which are considered of
                    military importance: (1) That participation in the control of all or any areas
                    in Antarctica should be denied to our most probable enemies, and (2) that the
                    arrangement should in no wise constitute a precedent which might prejudice
                    future interests of the United States in the Arctic. In reaching these
                    conclusions, we naturally did not take into account pertinent factors of a
                    purely political character which fall wholly within the province of the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>Assuming that the foregoing conditions can in fact be met, we would have no
                    objections from a military standpoint to the course of action which you propose.
                    Whether this can be done is a question which the State Department is better
                    qualified to answer than the National Military Establishment. Consequently, if
                    you conclude that there is every reasonable prospect that these conditions can
                    be fulfilled, then we are agreeable to your proceeding at once with the
                    implementation of your proposals. On the other hand, if you have doubts in this
                    regard, then I would prefer, as you suggest, to have the question submitted to
                    the National Security Council. Under such circumstances, the Council would, in
                    my opinion, be the appropriate agency in which to weigh the various military and
                    political considerations involved.</p>

                        impracticable for the United States Government to maintain these two

                    <p>In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would reaffirm their view that
                        settlement of the Antarctica problem should not be regarded as a <pb n="992"

                <p>The British Government’s response to the proposals advanced by the Department of
                    State in its <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of June 25 and the draft
                    agreement attached thereto (page 987) was set forth in a British Embassy <hi
                        rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of July 3 to the Department of State, not
                    printed. The British accepted in principle the United States initiative, but
                    they indicated they would prefer an eight-power condominium because a United
                    Nations trusteeship, as proposed by the United States, would give the Soviet
                    Union an opportunity to interfere in Antarctic affairs. The British also
                    objected to a United Nations trusteeship because it would involve and possibly
                    distort those chapters of the U.N. Charter intended, to apply to inhabited and
                    backward territories (800.014 Antarctic/7–348). In the light of the British
                    comments and criticisms, the Department of State revised its draft agreement to
                    provide for a condominium. For the text of the later draft, as circulated to
                    various interested governments, see the enclosure to the Department’s <hi

                    should tell Argentine and Chilean Governments informally that if they would
                    agree submit Antarctic claims to International Court, British Government would
                    not press its claims to certain of disputed areas. He said South Shetlands and

                    contemplated trying to hold, yielding elsewhere. Matter had reached Cabinet

                <p>He referred to Foreign Office’s telegram of July 2 to British Embassy Washington
                    instructing it inform Department urgently that (1) Foreign Office welcomed
                    Department’s proposals in general but considered Antarctica should not be placed
                    under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> because of opportunities for

                    latitude under Eight-Power control but that reservations would have to be made
                    re all of South Shetland Islands except Elephant and Clarence Island groups. He
                    mentioned that there had been insufficient time obtain Cabinet approval Foreign
                    Office’s telegram of July 2.</p>
                <p>He said he had heard nothing from British Embassy on this subject since July 2

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have received your letter of
                    July 1, 1948, regarding the proposed course of action relating to
                    Antarctica.</p>
                <p>The Department of State believes that there is every reasonable prospect that the
                    proposed course of action will deny to our most probable enemies participation
                    in the control of all or any areas in Antarctica, and that such control will be
                    exercised by friendly powers. These points will be borne in mind by the
                    Department’s Officers who are dealing with the problem.</p>
                <p>This Department also will inform all governments with which the problem has been
                    or will be discussed that the proposed course of action in Antarctica does not
                    in any way constitute a precedent which would affect, directly or indirectly,
                    the interests of the United States in the Arctic Polar Region.</p>
                <p>In view of these circumstances, the Department of State does not believe that
                    action by the National Security Council is necessary. However, <pb n="994"
                        xml:id="pg_994" facs="0504"/>I am transmitting copies of your letter of July

                <p>In April 1948, the Chilean Government asked the United States to send a
                    representative to Santiago to discuss the Antarctic question with Chilean
                    Foreign Ministry officials. The Department of State subsequently agreed to the
                    request subject to the understanding that the American Antarctic expert would
                    also go to Buenos Aires for conversations with Argentine officials. Caspar D.
                    Green of the Division of Northern European Affairs was selected to carry out the
                    mission to Santiago and Buenos Aires. Green took with him copies of the Draft
                    Agreement on Antarctica (page 984) and an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                    for presentation to the Chilean and Argentine Foreign Ministries. The <hi
                        rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> was the same one given to the Australian
                    Embassy and five other missions in Washington on August 9 (see <ref
                        target="#pg_996">page 996</ref>). Green also had with him an outline of oral
                    comments he might make.</p>
                <p>Green arrived in Santiago at the beginning of July, but because of a Chilean
                    cabinet crisis, conversations with Foreign Ministry officials were delayed until
                    July 12. Serving as the principal Chilean representatitve in talks with Green,
                    which lasted until July 17, was Professor Julio Escudero Guzman, former Legal
                    Adviser in the Chilean Foreign Ministry and unofficial consultant to the
                    Ministry. For a summary telegraphic report on Green’s mission to Santiago, see
                    telegram 495, July 19, from Santiago, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>. Detailed
                    reports on the talks were transmitted to the Department of State in despatches
                    460, July 13, 470, July 14, 475, July 19, 477, July 19, and 485, July 22, from
                    Santiago. These despatches are all included in file 800.014 Antarctic.</p>
                <p>Green travelled from Santiago to Buenos Aires for a brief visit. Accompanied by
                    Counsellor of Embassy Guy W. Ray, Green called upon Dr. Pascual La Rosa,
                    Subsecretary for Political Affairs of the Argentine Foreign Ministry, on July 21
                    and presented the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> and Draft Agreement on
                    Antarctica. The meeting, the only one Green had in Buenos Aires, was reported in
                    telegram 730, July 21, from Buenos Aires, <ref target="#pg_995">page 995</ref>
                    and in detail in despatch 468, July 21, from Buenos Aires not printed (800.014

                <p>495. Green cordially received here.<note n="1" xml:id="d245fn1">Regarding Caspar
                        D. Green’s mission to Santiago, see the editorial note, <hi rend="italic"
                            >supra</hi>.</note> In several sessions with Escudero he had given
                    background and explanation of US thinking on internationalization of Antarctic.
                    Escudero’s exposition of the Chilean viewpoint has stressed heavily special
                    quality American quadrant as part of Western Hemisphere, citing Hemisphere
                    defense zone and Panam resolution on European colonies among other things. On
                    trusteeship he doubts applicability of charter provisions to Antarctic case.
                    Feels Chile would have unique and unbeatable case before International Court and
                    that we may overrate difficulties that method solution. However, Chile not
                    committed itself as to court. Other Chilean officials have stressed desire avoid
                    repetition last season’s incidents and also apprehension of Argentina position
                    vis-à-vis Chile.</p>
                <p>Green noted US could not favor Chile and Argentina against UK or vice versa but
                    sought solution which fully safeguards Western Hemisphere interests and is
                    acceptable to all interested nations. Green has expressed hope their review of
                    practicable alternatives will lead them to conclusion similar to ours. In final
                    conversation Escudero presented for consideration draft for joint declaration by
                    interested nations which would freeze present legal rights and interests for
                    period five or ten years (actions in Antarctica by declaring countries during
                    that period to have no legal effect on their rights) and eliminate levying of
                    whaling fees by UK.</p>

                <p>The following considerations, in briefest outline, have led the United States
                    Government to the conclusion that the establishment of an international status
                    for the Antarctic area is the most practicable and preferable method of solving
                    the problem of conflicting and potentially conflicting claims in that area.</p>
                <p>The prestige of several nations is engaged in the area. Very difficult problems
                    would be posed, should a division among the various national sovereignties be
                    sought through the International Court. The foreseeable values of Antarctica are
                    predominantly scientific rather than strategic or economic. An international
                    regime would be well calculated to promote the exploitation of these scientific
                    values. Internationalization, therefore, appears to present the best possibility
                    of removing the area from the field of present or potential future contention,
                    at the same time preserving to the interested nations control over the strategic
                    use and possible economic value of the area.</p>
                <p>The conflict of interests, the friction and disagreement generated by the
                    conflict of claims, and the unsettled status of Antarctica perturbs otherwise
                    amicable relations and is, moreover, susceptible of exploitation <pb n="997"
                        xml:id="pg_997" facs="0507"/>to the disadvantage of the interested nations
                    by nations and groups who hope to profit from discord.</p>
                <p>An international administration for the Antarctic continent and sub-Antarctic
                    islands would promote the further systematic scientific exploration and
                    investigation of Antarctic phenomena. It would facilitate the correlation of
                    meteorological observations of practical significance in long range weather
                    forecast, particularly for countries of the Southern Hemisphere. A settlement by
                    internationalization should, as stated above, also remove the area from the
                    field of present or potential future conflict, at the same time preserving to
                    the interested nations control over any actual or potential values which the
                    area may contain, while widening the sphere of friendly, cooperative
                    international endeavor.</p>
                <p>The United States hopes that the interested nations will endeavor to agree on
                    some form of internationalization of the area. In order to provide a basis for
                    discussion, a plan for an international administration of the area has been
                    prepared. However, the United States will welcome suggestions from Australia,
                    and will gladly discuss any alternative proposals.</p>

                        conduct scientific investigations, develop resources and carry on other
                        activities consistent with the purposes of this agreement.</p>

                        insure that undertakings in the area shall be consistent with these plans.
                        They agree also to foster individually and jointly the establishment of
                        facilities and the conduct of scientific investigations.</p>
                    <p>3. The parties hereto likewise agree to foster, under such rules as the
                        Commission may prescribe, free access to, and freedom of transit through or
                        over the area. The Commission may prescribe that expeditions and stations
                        within the area display an emblem representing the international commission
                        as well as any national emblem or flag which they may display.</p>

                    </note> The Department of State has now worked out a definition of the area in
                    Antarctica to be claimed by the United States. A copy is attached. It is desired
                    to obtain the concurrence of the National Defense Establishment with this
                    definition of the area. There is annexed also a map<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3"
                        >Not reproduced.</note> which shows the area contemplated by the textual
                    definition. It is not expected, however, that any map will he issued or made
                    public in connection with the announcement of the official American claim. It
                    will be noted, of course, that the claim is not defined in terms of a
                    sector.</p>
                <p>In view of the conversations undertaken with the interested countries and the
                    pending release of a commercial film on an American naval expedition to
                    Antarctica, it is expected that there will be increasing publicity on this
                    subject and I should like as soon as possible to be prepared to announce the
                    American claim. It would therefore be appreciated if this matter could be given
                    urgent attention. Mr. Samuel W. Boggs, the State Department Geographic Adviser,
                    will make himself available if officers of the Defense Forces desire to confer
                    with him on the subject.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The United States Government claims territory in the Antarctic regions which
                        are described below, on the basis of activities of citizens of the United
                        States who have participated in Antarctic expeditions over a period of
                        nearly 130 years. These claims are founded upon numerous discoveries made by
                        many expeditions, and upon extensive surveying and mapping operations by
                        sea, land, and air, covering a great portion of the Antarctic coast and
                        hundreds of thousands of square miles of hinterland. They include large
                        areas which have been explored or seen only by members of expeditions
                        supported from the United States, either by the Government or privately;
                        they also include large areas already claimed by or on behalf of other
                        countries, hut in which the achievements of expeditions supported from the
                        United States afford a basis for territorial claims which are of such
                        validity as fully to justify claims by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Antarctic territories claimed by the United States comprise the
                        following: <list>

                <p>The Ambassador of Chile referred to the recent visit to Chile of the Department’s
                    special representative, Mr. Green, to discuss the question of the Antarctic. He
                    said that during these discussions the Chilean Government proposed a sort of
                    stand-still agreement under under which none of the countries interested in
                    Antarctica would make efforts to promote their claims during a five year period
                    and during this period Antarctica would be open to scientific and meteorological
                    study by all. The Ambassador also referred to the U.S. proposal of a
                    condominium. He stated informally and unofficially that this proposal did not
                    appear attractive to his Government judging from despatches he has received. He
                    requested that the Chilean proposal be given serious consideration by the
                    Government of the United States.</p>
                <p>I assured the Chilean Ambassador that it would receive careful consideration. I
                    then pointed out that there was a time element involved since, if one person in
                    the world so decided, agreement between the interested parties could be upset.
                    The Ambassador indicated he thought my reference was to Great Britain. In view
                    of this misunderstanding I told him frankly I had the Soviet Union in mind
                    adding I had seen a memorandum which referred to claims by the Soviets that they
                    had acquired rights in Antarctica by explorations more valid than those of some
                    western hemisphere countries based upon royal grants during colonial times. This
                    seemed to be a new thought to the Ambassador and he appeared to be impressed by
                    the possibility of Russia advancing a claim. I added that by such a maneuver the
                    Soviets might hope to gain a foothold in the western hemisphere.</p>

                <p>Ambassador Makin called this morning by appointment made at his request.</p>
                <p>He referred to the United States proposal for an international administration of
                    Antarctica. He said that Australia’s right to the territory under its
                    administration in Antarctica had been unchallenged and that they had never
                    thought of the necessity for an international administration. They felt there
                    might be some difficulties. There are no people in Antarctica, but there is, for
                    instance, the matter of whaling in Antarctic waters. They would look favorably
                    upon an arrangement for scientific cooperation. He assured me of Dr. Evatt’s
                    desire to work out a satisfactory arrangement and said that Dr. Evatt would like
                    to see me to discuss the subject. He said Dr. Evatt had suggested that we might
                    have someone in London, or in Europe, who could converse with Dr. Evatt, giving
                    him fuller information on our viewpoint, preparatory to his seeing me.</p>
                <p>Upon Mr. Green’s statement that there was no great urgency, I replied that I
                    would be glad to look into the possibility of meeting Dr. Evatt’s request.</p>
                <p>I said that we had met a completely negative response from Argentina and Chile,
                    which regard the matter as one of national sovereignty. Our feeling is that the
                    situation is so complicated and the other means of settlement are so complicated
                    that we are afraid we would come out the same hole we went in; that we want to
                    work out a settlement and that internationalization seems to us the way to get
                    it. We think we can get over any difficulties it may present.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Makin said he felt sure that Dr. Evatt and I could work out an
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>(As Ambassador Makin and Mr. Harry went out, they told Mr. Green they hoped very
                    much that we would not have to make any public announcement until there had been
                    time to come to agreement. Mr. Harry asked if more details were available on the
                    US claim., Mr. Green said the time was subject to decision and that we would try
                    to give them as mush advance notice as possible.)</p>

                <p>On August 28, the Department of State issued to the press a statement explaining
                    that the Department of State had approached the Governments of Argentina,
                    Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom informally
                    with a suggestion that a solution for the territorial problem of Antarctica be
                    discussed. For the text of the statement, see Department of State <hi

                    Department indicate that the statement was issued because statements regarding
                    the Antarctica discussions had already been issued by British Foreign Office and
                    the Chilean Foreign Ministry.</p>

                    concerning the definition of the areas in Antarctica which are to be claimed by
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>In considering your request, I have sought and obtained the views of the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff. They are of the opinion that the proposed definition of areas
                    to be claimed includes all areas to which the United States claim may reasonably
                    be made, and that the definition of areas is sufficiently general to provide
                    adequate flexibility for working out future details, which applies particularly
                    to more precise determination yet to be made of the results of the most recent
                    United States Antarctic explorations. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded, and I
                    concur, that there is no objection from the military standpoint to the proposal
                    of the Department of State concerning the areas within Antarctica which should
                    be claimed by the United States.</p>
                <p>For your information, I enclose a copy<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">Not
                        printed.</note> of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as expressed to

                        printed. Airgram A–1046, September 25, from Paris, not printed, reported
                        that the French Foreign Ministry desired to have further information about
                        the Draft Agreement on Antarctica before reaching a decision. The Embassy
                        commented that the request for clarification might be in the nature of a
                        stall to avoid giving a more definitely negative answer. Conversations
                        between Embassy representatives and Foreign Ministry officials indicated a
                        pronounced reluctance on the part of the French as regards the reunuciation
                        of Antarctic claims and their merger in an international body (800.014
                        Antarctic/9–2548).</note> which requests information on several points of
                    the United States Government’s proposal for discussion of the problem of
                    Antarctica. The views of this Government on the questions raised are given in
                    the following paragraphs, numbered to correspond with the numbers In the French
                    Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1. The United States proposal envisages the joining and merging of national
                    claims. This would eliminate the establishment of individual national
                    sovereignty over particular portions of the area. It would establish the joint
                    sovereignty of the interested Governments over the area as a whole.</p>
                <p>2. The United States proposal is intended to provide for complete liberty of bona
                    fide scientific research. In order to promote the rational planning and carrying
                    out of such research, the proposal recommends the development by the interested
                    countries, acting through <pb n="1006" xml:id="pg_1006" facs="0516"/>the
                    Antarctic Commission, of an overall plan of scientific investigation. It is
                    hoped that each of the participating countries might undertake, upon completion
                    of the general plan, so to plan its individual projects as to contribute to the
                    accomplishment of some portion of that general plan. It is felt that this would
                    be a useful arrangement to avoid duplication of effort, and to promote full,
                    well-rounded investigation. However, with the single exception that no two
                    expeditions should be stationed in such immediate proximity as to interfere with
                    each other’s operations, the United States Government feels that each country
                    should be entirely free to send independent expeditions into any part of the
                    area.</p>
                <p>It is the thought of the United States Government that the regime would, as a
                    minimum, promote and facilitate the exchange and common availability of
                    scientific results.</p>
                <p>3. It is the judgment of the United States Government that the cost of
                    administration would, for the foreseeable future, be very small. Administrative
                    functions would be at a minimum. Although no prospectus of a budget has been
                    worked out, it is thought that the expense of each country would be limited to
                    the part-time assignment of one or two officials to serve on the Commission and
                    a share in the maintenance of a permanent Commission office to serve as a
                    clearing house for information, exchange of data, preparation of agenda for
                    Commission meetings, and similar functions.</p>
                <p>4. It is the thought of the United States Government that the scope of an
                    agreement with regard to Antarctica should not extend to matters which involve
                    the oceans surrounding that area. This concept seems appropriate with regard to
                    defense and security as well as with regard to other aspects, such as
                    whaling.</p>
                <p>The United States Government will welcome suggestions for the clarification or
                    improvement of the proposed Article VI. The United States Government considers
                    that a provision should be included in the proposal for agreement which would
                    permit defense measures to be taken individually or jointly should the need
                    arise. It is felt, however, that the eight nations, jointly, acting through the
                    Commission, should retain the right to disapprove measures of defense proposed
                    by any individual nation.</p>
                <p>5. The proposal put forward by the United States Government envisages, under
                    Article IV, an informal cooperative relationship between the Antarctic
                    Commission and the specialized agencies (especially the scientific agencies) of
                    the United Nations, for the mutual benefit of the Commission and the United
                    Nations agencies. Practicable suggestions looking towards a closer or more
                    formal relationship will be welcomed.</p>
                <pb n="1007" xml:id="pg_1007" facs="0517"/>
                <p>The Department of State hopes that the foregoing will be useful to the French
                    Government in understanding the views of the United States Government on the
                    points covered. The Department of State is gratified at the expression of the
                    French Government’s willingness to enter upon discussions seeking a solution of
                    the Antarctic problem. The Department of State will welcome any observations or
                    suggestions from the French Government on the subject.</p>

                <p>Mr. Eustace said he came under instruction to bring to our attention the interest
                    of South Africa in the Antarctic proposals mentioned in our press release of
                    August 28, 1948.<note n="1" xml:id="d255fn1">See the editorial note, <ref
                            target="#pg_1004">p. 1004</ref>.</note> He said he was speaking quite
                    informally and did not intend to send us a note or any other communication. He
                    spoke from a page of notes, a copy of which is attached.</p>
                <p>I said I would be glad to comment equally informally giving my personal first
                    reactions which should be regarded as unofficial. I was interested in the South
                    African view that Antarctica is <hi rend="italic">terra nullius</hi> and asked
                    if that meant that none of the claims advanced would stand up in court. He said
                    this was about the position apart from places like the Falkland Islands which
                    had long been inhabited. I pointed out that the Falkland Islands did not come
                    into our definition of the area and added that we too have doubts as to how far
                    any of the claims which have been filed would be recognized by an international
                    court under the accepted rules of international law.</p>
                <p>I agreed that control of the area would be of vital concern to South Africa and
                    that we had had this in mind when we drafted our plan, particularly in the
                    provision for new member nations. However, I thought we would be embarrassed to
                    bring any other nations into it <pb n="1008" xml:id="pg_1008" facs="0518"
                    />before an agreement was reached since this might be a precedent for bringing
                    in still other nations which we were taking care not to invite directly or
                    indirectly. Specifically we had in mind Russia which had explored part of the
                    area over a hundred years ago and had left names for some of the geographical
                    features.</p>
                <p>I said that whaling did not come into the picture as we contemplated only the
                    land area, and whaling is covered by a separate international agreement. I
                    agreed that meteorological data would be of utmost value to all the Southern
                    Hemisphere and this and other scientific investigation seemed now to promise the
                    main value of the continent. We have thought of trans-Antarctic airways, but
                    from a study of the map, have concluded that this was not likely to be of
                    interest, as, apart from Polar weather hazards, great circle routes between
                    major cities in the Southern Hemisphere do not pass over the continent. As
                    regards economic exploitation, we felt it to be of minor importance on the basis
                    of our present knowledge, but were aware that future developments might change
                    this.</p>
                <p>With regard to informing him of the details of our approach to the other
                    countries, I said I would want to consult other officers of the Department and
                    would let him know next week.</p>
                <p>He said he would not discuss this with any other Embassy here. I agreed this was
                    best but I saw no objection if he wanted to talk to the British about it.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Refer to State Department, Washington, Press Release of 28th August,
                        1948.</p>
                    <p>2. The Union has not hitherto advanced any claim to Antarctic territory most
                        of which it has regarded as <hi rend="italic">terra nullius.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. However, South Africa is the only major power in the Southern Hemisphere
                        which is apparently to have no say in the future control and administration
                        of the Antarctic Continent.</p>
                    <p>4. Control, when it is exercised, will doubtless prove to be of vital concern
                        to the Union.</p>
                    <p>5. No one would deny our important whaling interests in the Antarctic.</p>
                    <p>6. On the meterological side we hope to benefit from the establishment of
                        stations at Antarctic bases.</p>
                    <pb n="1009" xml:id="pg_1009" facs="0519"/>
                    <p>7. When trans-Arctic air communications become possible, they will be of
                        definite interest to South Africa as will be apparent from any map.</p>
                    <p>8. When economic exploitation and development become possible, doubtless the
                        Union will be one of the main bases from which operations will take
                        place.</p>
                    <p>9. Finally, in the field of long range and long term strategy, the control of
                        Antarctica will always be a matter of major concern to South Africa.</p>
                    <p>These points it is hoped will indicate the extent of South Africa’s interests
                        and should justify consideration being given to the association of the Union
                        with any organization or machinery which may be devised to control and
                        administer the Antarctic Continent.</p>
                    <p>The Union Government will be grateful to receive particulars of the approach
                        which has been made to the Governments so far concerned and trusts that the
                        United States will appreciate the extent of South Africa’s concern with the
                        proposals for some form of internationalization of the Antarctic Continent.
                        It is accordingly hoped that an opportunity will be provided for the South
                        African Government to comment in detail on any proposals which are made in
                        this regard.</p>

                <p>A Belgian Embassy Memorandum, dated October 8, 1948, called to the attention of
                    the Department of State the Belgian exploration activities in Antarctica in
                    1898–1899 and indicated that Belgium was entitled to participate in the
                    settlement of the Antarctic question. A copy of the Draft Agreement on
                    Antarctica was transmitted to the Belgian Embassy under cover of a Department of
                    State note of December 31, 1948. The Department’s note informed the Belgian
                    Embassy that only those states which had advanced claims to sovereignty in the
                    Antarctic had been approached regarding a solution of the Antarctic problem. The
                    note further explained that although the United States had not yet advanced
                    claims in Antarctica, the activities of its nationals over a long period of time
                    and covering a large part of Antarctica gave it a sound basis for undertaking an
                    initiative in the matter (800.014 Antarctic/12–3148).</p>

                        printed.</note> from the Chargé d’Affaires ad interim of this Embassy, the
                    Ambassador has the honor to inform His Excellency that the Norwegian Government
                    has now studied with great interest the United States’ proposal in this
                    matter.</p>
                <p>Norwegian scientists have, as known, made considerable contributions to the
                    exploration of Antarctica, and the Norwegian Government will continue to do its
                    utmost to promote scientific research in this area. The Norwegian Government
                    also firmly desires to contribute to the increase of international co-operation
                    in this field. In this connection may be mentioned that in 1949 a
                    Norwegian-British-Swedish expedition, under Norwegian leadership, will be sent
                    to Queen Maud Land. <pb n="1012" xml:id="pg_1012" facs="0522"/>It is assumed
                    that this expedition will carry on its scientific research through 1952.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian Government is confident, however, that the creation of fully
                    satisfactory international cooperation in the scientific field will be possible
                    without establishing an international regime for the Antarctic area, as proposed
                    by the United States Government. It will be remembered that in a field of utmost
                    importance in Antarctica, namely the meteorological field, an international
                    scientific body—the Committee for Polar Meteorology created by the International
                    Meteorological Organization—has already been established. As far as whaling is
                    concerned, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, dated
                    December 2, 1946, lays down that the International Whaling Commission to be
                    established shall encourage, recommend or, if necessary, organize studies and
                    investigations relating to whales and whaling (Article IV, 1 (<hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi>)).</p>
                <p>The Norwegian Government assumes that the interested governments should
                    concentrate their efforts mainly on supporting and facilitating the stipulated
                    tasks of the already existing international organizations for scientific
                    research in Antarctica. The Norwegian Government realizes, however, that the
                    International Committee for Polar Meteorology and the International Whaling
                    Commission cannot cover all fields where scientific research might be desirable,
                    and will consequently welcome any proposal for the establishment of additional,
                    purely scientific, international organizations. Their functions should, however,
                    be clearly defined and coordinated to avoid competition between two or more
                    international organizations.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the Norwegian Government deems it desirable that all interested
                    governments pledge themselves mutually to impart to each other the results of
                    scientific research performed by their respective nationals.</p>
                <p>Consequently, the Norwegian Government considers the establishment of an
                    international administration for Antarctica unnecessary for the carrying out of
                    the desirable scientific tasks, and cannot subscribe to an arrangement, whereby
                    Norway would waive her exclusive sovereignty over her territories south of the
                    60 degree south latitude. Norway’s sovereignty over these areas is firmly based
                    upon international law, and the Norwegian Government is confident that the
                    United States Government will appreciate that Norway cannot, for reasons of a
                    national and political character, yield her exclusive sovereignty over what is
                    Norwegian territory.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian Government assumes furthermore that the fact of some individual
                    countries having exclusive sovereignty over certain areas in the Antarctic will
                    be an incentive for such countries to pursue scientific research there, for the
                    benefit of all mankind. Sovereignty <pb n="1013" xml:id="pg_1013" facs="0523"
                    />can hardly be an impediment to scientific operations. Thus the above mentioned
                    Norwegian-British-Swedish expedition shows that Norway’s exclusive sovereignty
                    over Queen Maud Land in no way impedes co-operation with foreign governments
                    with regard to scientific activities in this area.</p>
                <p>The Norwegian Government has noted that the South Shetland and the South Orkney
                    groups, both situated south of the 60 degree south latitude are excepted from
                    the proposed plan (excepted is also South Georgia, situated north of the 60
                    degree south latitude). By excepting some of the most important areas, claimed
                    by several countries, it seems that this plan would not prove effective in
                    settling the most acute international disagreements in the Antarctic area,
                    which, as far as the Norwegian Government understands, is its foremost political
                    purpose The sacrifice Norway eventually would have to make by renouncing her
                    exclusive sovereignty over Peter I’s Island and the territory between the 45
                    degree east longitude and the 20 degree west longitude (Queen Maud Land) would
                    thus not contribute effectively to the establishment of peace and harmony in the
                    Antarctic.</p>

                        conversations in London between British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin and
                        Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia on Antarctica. The Department of State
                        had been informed by the Chilean Embassy in Washington that Bevin had
                        proposed to Bramuglia that Britain and Argentina refrain from establishing
                        new bases and sending naval patrols into the disputed Antarctic area during
                        the coming Antarctic season. Bramuglia agreed subject to Chilean
                        participation, but Chile in turn had suggested inclusion of the United
                        States (800.014 Antarctic/11–2248).</note> re UK-Argentine-Chilean dispute
                    over Antarctic claims.</p>
                <p>Shuckburgh Foreign Office explained to us today that during course
                    Bevin–Bramuglia conversation November 8, Bevin said it would be desirable for
                    both countries avoid naval displays in waters south of 60 degrees south
                    latitude. It was agreed (1) Chile would have to be included in any such
                    understanding, and (2) Argentina rather than UK would approach Chile. Peron
                    immediately approved proposed informal agreement in principle and Foreign Office
                    handed to Argentine Ambassador on November 12 draft of undertaking it was
                    prepared give to Argentina if reciprocated. Foreign Office handed copy this <pb
                        n="1014" xml:id="pg_1014" facs="0524"/>draft to Chilean Chargé November 15
                    with respect Chile on same basis. Text follows:</p>
                <p>[Here follows the draft text of a declaration regarding the intention of the
                    United Kingdom (and Chile and Argentina) not to send warships south of Latitude
                    60° during the 1948–49 Antarctic season. For the full text of the agreed
                    U.K.-Chilean-Argentine declaration, exchanged and issued to the press on January
                    18, 1949, see <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates</hi>, House of Lords, 5th
                    series, vol. 160, col. 419.]</p>
                <p>Shuckburgh said that both before and after this text was handed to Argentines and
                    Chileans, Chileans maintained that Bevin also offered to Bramuglia standstill
                    agreement on establishment new Antarctic posts. This is completely untrue,
                    Shuckburgh asserted. Chileans have told Foreign Office that Argentines told them
                    that was the case. On Foreign Office inquiry, Argentines denied they understood
                    proposed agreement to cover new posts in addition naval displays; in other
                    words, according Shuckburgh, Argentines agree with Foreign Office version
                    Bevin-Bramuglia talk. Shuckburgh said all this indicates (1) that Argentines
                    misinformed Chileans who are acting in good faith, (2) that Chileans invented
                    idea that standstill proposal was made in Bevin-Bramuglia talk as means of
                    having it included in three-power understanding. Shuckburgh inclined favor
                    second theory. Shuckburgh said Chileans very anxious for agreement this point,
                    but UK completely unwilling accept it as it might appear to represent
                    recognition of legality of Argentine and Chilean Antarctic posts. Chile still
                    disputing with UK this point re scope of Bevin–Bramuglia discussions.</p>
                <p>Foreign Office would prefer no public declaration but does not feel strongly
                    about this.</p>
                <p>Shuckburgh expressed regret US should have learned of proposed three-power
                    understanding from Chileans rather than from UK, and, explained that US had not
                    been included since it was inconceivable to Foreign Office that US might send
                    warships into Antarctic waters as display of force. Foreign Office considered
                    inclusion of US in proposed agreement unnecessary.</p>
                <p>Shuckburg added that British Embassy Washington only now in possession of all
                    facts since Foreign Office “stupidly” sent copies of various documents to it for
                    information by pouch instead of by cable. British Embassy now fully informed and
                    able discuss matter with Department if desired.</p>
                <p>He mentioned Australia and New Zealand have agreed to UK’s acceptance of US
                    proposal for 8–power Antarctic administration. British Embassy will soon be
                    instructed ascertain whether Department now luke warm to its own proposals; he
                    said Department does not seem to be pressing idea now and he wondered whether
                    this foreshadowed abandonment of proposed scheme by US.</p>

                        printed.</note>). Dept expressed to Chil Amb desire to cooperate in every
                    practicable way and to make any confidential or public statement that wld be
                    appropriate in circumstances. On Nov 30 Chil <gloss target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss>
                    was informed that Dept believes it wld be even more effective and appropriate
                    for US Gov to make a parallel but separate statement either confidentially to
                    three Govs concerned or publicly if those Govs so desired. Basis for separate
                    statement rather than participation in tripartite understanding wld be (<hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi>) US cld make more unqualified commitment re sending
                    vessels, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) further Chil negotiation with Arg and Gr
                    Brit wld probably be required for US quadripartite participation, and (<hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi>) Dept doubts appropriateness of quadripartite
                    participation because it pertains to problem which has directly concerned only
                    other three countries. Dept’s statement wld be as follows:</p>
                <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>“The Gov of the US is very pleased to learn that the Govs of Arg, Chile and
                        Gr Brit have informed each other that (text of final understanding to be
                        quoted here).</p>
                    <p>This Gov does not contemplate sending any vessels to Antarctic during the
                        1948–1949 Antarctic season”.</p>
                </quote>
                <p>Since US considers not appropriate be party to agreement or declaration, Dept
                    does not feel it shd comment on inclusion of point about no new bases. However,
                    Dept mentioned to Chil <gloss target="#t_Emb1">Emb</gloss> our understanding
                    that UK disinclined to include this point.</p>

                        London<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">Not printed; it set forth the
                        Department’s assumption that the British and Argentine Governments would
                        welcome a possible United States statement indicated in telegram 431 of
                        December 1 (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>), but instructed the Embassy in
                        London to seek informal British reaction. Identical instructions were sent
                        to the Embassy in Argentina (800.014 Antaretic/12–148).</note> regarding
                    Antarctic claims dispute. Shuckburgh said Foreign Office would naturally welcome
                    parallel US declaration such as Department suggested but he assumed Department
                    would not wish make statement until and unless assured that Foreign Office would
                    make similar one. Foreign Office cannot yet give such assurance since its making
                    declaration is contingent upon assurances from Argentine and Chilean Governments
                    that they prepared do same. He said Argentine Government has not yet informed
                    Foreign Office of its approval of Foreign Office’s suggested text but no reason
                    suppose Argentina has changed attitude which was agreement in principle.</p>
                <p>Shuckburgh stated Chileans have not told Foreign Office they have abandoned idea
                    regarding no new bases. Until Chile drops this idea UK and Argentine unable make
                    declarations he said.</p>
                <p>He remarked Bevin’s idea as expressed in talk with Bramuglia has already largely
                    accomplished its beneficial purpose and that it not of great importance whether
                    formal exchanges of statements take place. He promised keep Embassy informed of
                    developments with Department’s proposed statement in mind.</p>
                <p>Asked whether Foreign Officer preferred Department’s statement to be public or
                    confidential, Shuckburgh said Department may wish do same as Foreign Office
                    which will be guided by Argentine and Chilean preference. This preference will
                    not be determined until and unless Argentina, Chile and UK reach agreement on
                    exchange of declarations.</p>
