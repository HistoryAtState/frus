    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the
     official documentary historical record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
     significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series documents the facts
     and events that contributed to the formulation of policies and includes evidence of supporting
     and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
    <p>The Historian of the Department of State is responsible for the preparation of the <hi
      rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The editing of the series in the Office of the
     Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, is guided by principles of historical objectivity and
     accuracy. Documents are not altered or deletions made without indicating where changes have
     been made. Every effort is made to identify lacunae in the record and to explain why they have
     occurred. Certain omissions may be necessary to protect national security or to condense the
     record and avoid needless repetition. The published record, however, omits no facts that were
     of major importance in reaching a decision, and nothing has been excluded for the purpose of
     concealing or glossing over a defect in policy.</p>
    <p>At the time of the compilation of this volume in 1987, the Department was guided in the
     preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series by official regulations
     first promulgated by Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26,
     1925. A new statutory charter for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> series was established by Title IV of Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations
     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by the President on October 28,
     1991. That new charter requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series “shall
     be a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of major United States foreign policy
     decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity.” The new charter also requires
     that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published “not more than 30 years
     after the events recorded.”</p>

    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations of the United
      States Series</hi></p>
    <p>This volume is part of a comprehensive subseries of volumes that will document the most
     important issues in the foreign policy of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D.
      Eisenhower</persName>’s administration. The subseries covers the years 1958 through 1960.
     Other volumes in the 1958–1960 triennium that cover the Middle East region are <ref
      target="frus1958-60v12">Volume XII</ref>, Near and Middle East, and <ref
      target="frus1958-60v13">Volume XIII</ref>, Arab-Israeli Dispute; United Arab Republic; North
     Africa.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
    <p>The law requires that the published record contained in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
      Relations</hi> series must reflect all major foreign policy decisions and activities and
     include relevant documentation from all government agencies and entities involved in foreign
     policy formulation, execution, or support. The historical records of the Presidents and their
     national security advisers together with the still larger body of documentation in the
     Department of State are the principal sources for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
     series. The National Archives and Records Administration, including the Presidential libraries
     that it administers, is the main repository and coordinating authority for historical
     government records and a major source for the documents and information included in the series.
     Specific sources used in preparing this volume and its microfiche supplement are described in
     detail in the List of Sources, <ref target="frus1958-60v13">pages XIII</ref>–<ref
      target="frus1958-60v18">XVIII</ref>.</p>

    <p>This volume and its microfiche supplement were planned and compiled as an integrated
     publication. Taken together, the two parts of the publication provide extensive documentation
     on U.S. relations with Lebanon and Jordan during the final 3 years of the <persName
      corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration. Given the bulk of extant records,
     however, this publication includes only a selection of the most important documents dealing
     with U.S. policy toward Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
    <p>As such, the editor, <persName>Louis J. Smith</persName>, has chosen to focus the printed
     volume on the 1958 crisis that led to the introduction of U.S. forces into Lebanon and British
     forces into Jordan and to include the remaining documents for the period, which largely date
     from 1959 and 1960, in the microfiche supplement. In this manner, the 1958 crises, which
     defined the shape of U.S. relations with these two countries until the end of the <persName
      corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration, are treated primarily in the printed
     volume and are given editorial priority. Annotations in the printed volume identify by means of
     cross references particularly relevant documents contained in the microfiche supplement. In
     preparing the integrated publication, the editor has emphasized the diplomatic, <pb n="V"
      xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"/>political, and military aspects of U.S. foreign policy rather than
     the economic, cultural, and informational relations between the United States and the countries
     of Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
    <p>Several important topics have been used as the focal points for the selection of documents
     included in this publication. A primary objective of the publication has been to document the
     discussions, recommendations, decisions, and the flow of information that constituted the
     policymaking process in Washington during the crises that occurred in Lebanon and Jordan. In
     particular, the decisions that led to the introduction of U.S. military forces in Lebanon in
     July and U.S. support for the British landings in Jordan shortly thereafter are traced from the
     background considerations that took place during the 6 months preceding the crises to the
     aftermath assessments following the withdrawal of the troops in October and November.</p>
    <p>Records on the management of the crises are particularly rich among the historical papers
     maintained by the Eisenhower Library. The centralized and decentralized files of the Department
     of State also include a large collection of presidential and National Security Council
     documents, a portion of which were selected for inclusion in this publication. Senior-level
     military decisions on the planning and implementation of military operations in Lebanon and the
     eastern Mediterrean theater were found and selected from the records of the Joint Chiefs of
     Staff deposited at the National Archives.</p>
    <p>Cable traffic between Washington and Beirut and Amman provides the most important source of
     documentation on the extensive negotiations that were conducted with the governments of Lebanon
     and Jordan over military support for the two countries. Most of the negotiations with the
     government of Lebanese President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Camille Chamoun</persName> and the
     Jordanian government of King Hussein were conducted, on instructions from Washington, by
     Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">Robert McClintock</persName> in Beirut and Chargé
      <persName>Thomas</persName> Wright in Amman. Under Secretary of State <persName
      corresp="#p_MRD2">Robert Murphy</persName> assisted those efforts during a special mission to
     the Middle East. Documents concerning these negotiations were selected from the central files
     of the Department of State.</p>
    <p>The U.S. military operation in Lebanon, which the Lebanese Government requested, began on
     July 15 and continued until October. British troops began arriving at Amman airport on July 17
     and remained in Jordan until the beginning of November. The editor has selected documents
     relating to the military activities from a wide range of files located in the Eisenhower
     Library and the Department of State. Department of Defense files, and particularly Joint Chiefs
     of Staff records, were important in documenting military decisions, coordination with British
     forces, and troop and fleet movements. The editor did not, however, seek to provide detailed
     documentation of U.S. and allied military operations in the Middle East.</p>
    <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>
    <p>Another important goal of this publication has been to present selected documents recording
     the close coordination of U.S. policy with the British government of Prime Minister <persName
      corresp="#p_MHS2">Harold Macmillan</persName>. This coordination involved a steady stream of
     communication between Washington and London, visits such as Foreign Secretary <persName
      corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>’s to Washington in July, and telephone calls and
     letters exchanged directly between President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
     and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>. Memoranda, letters, and
     telegrams documenting this coordination were selected from the central files of the Department
     of State, from key files at the Eisenhower Library, such as the Eisenhower Diaries, the
     International Series in the Whitman File, White House Telephone Conversations, and the
      <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>–Lloyd Correspondence in the Dulles
     Papers.</p>
    <p>Following the end of the crises and the withdrawal of U.S. and British forces in the autumn
     of 1958, U.S. policymakers continued to be concerned about the political and economic viability
     of Lebanon and Jordan. Jordan was believed to be particularly vulnerable, thus requiring
     high-level consideration. In general, however, officials in the Department of State and the
     Embassies in Beirut and Amman took over the watch. The President did become involved on
     occasion, as when King Hussein visited Washington in 1959 and 1960, but in the normal course of
     events the relations between the United States and Lebanon and Jordan were defined and
     maintained through the cables that passed between Washington and Beirut and Amman. The editor
     has selected for publication a portion of the available cables from the central files and lot
     files of the Department of State.</p>
    <p>For this volume, the editor has not attempted to document particular U.S. intelligence
     operations or any significant contribution that U.S. intelligence made to the formulation of
     foreign policy. Intelligence records, including documents originated by the Central
     Intelligence Agency that are to be found among the collections of the Eisenhower Library, were
     consulted. That research was accomplished with the full cooperation and assistance of the
      <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. It did not, however, result in the inclusion in this
     volume of any key intelligence analyses that contributed to the major political and diplomatic
     actions.</p>
    <p>Completion of the declassification of this printed volume and its microfiche supplement, and
     the final steps of their preparation for publication, coincided with the development of
     procedures since early 1991 by the Central Intelligence Agency in cooperation with the
     Department of State that have expanded access by Department historians to high-level
     intelligence documents from among those records still in the custody of the Central
     Intelligence Agency. The Department of State chose not to postpone the publication of this
     volume to ascertain how such access might affect the scope of available documentation and the
     changes that might be made in the contents of this particular <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII"
      facs="0011"/>volume. The Department of State, however, is making good use of these new
     procedures, which have been arranged by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s History
     Staff, for the compilation of future volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
     series.</p>
    <p>The declassification review process for this print volume and its microfiche supplement
     resulted in the withholding from publication of 4.2 percent of the documents originally
     selected for the print volume and 8.9 percent of the documents originally selected for the
     microfiche supplement. Deletions from documents dealing with developments in Lebanon were
     minimal, and related largely to minor references to intelligence matters. The editor is
     confident that the documents dealing with Lebanon, as presented in the print volume and the
     microfiche supplement, provide a comprehensive and accurate record of U.S. relations with that
     country during the 1958–1960 period. Most of the deletions from the proposed text of the print
     volume and the microfiche supplement were made in documents dealing with developments in
     Jordan. The still-classified documents omitted from the publication relate to matters of
     continuing sensitivity in U.S.-Jordanian relations. Consequently, the account of U.S. relations
     with Jordan printed here is incomplete and does not accurately reflect the full range of
     U.S.-Jordanian concerns. In the judgment of the editor, however, the documentation concerning
     Jordan originally intended for publication but denied declassification does not distort the
     record.</p>
    <p>The editor wishes to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the National Archives and
     Records Agency’s <persName>Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Library, in particular David
     Haight.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
    <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time. Incoming telegrams
     from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of State or other
     receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed
     according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was
     drafted. During periods of crisis and intense activity, especially immediately before, during,
     and after troop landings in Lebanon on July 15 and those in Jordan on July 17, the editor has
     not always been able to arrange some documents precisely in their chronological order. In these
     cases he has used his best judgment.</p>
    <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
     series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and
     the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including
     marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Obvious typographical
     errors are corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source <pb n="VIII"
      xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set
     in italic type; an addition in roman type. Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate text
     that deals with an unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
     declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not declassified has been
     noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source text that were omitted. The amount
     of material omitted because it was unrelated, however, is not accounted for. All ellipses and
     brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
    <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original classification,
     distribution, and drafting information. The source footnote also provides the background of
     important documents and policies and indicates if the President or his major policy advisers
     read the document. Every effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously
     published, and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
    <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in this
     volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources, provide references to
     important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and provide
     summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed
     documents. Information devived from memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when
     necessary to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi></p>
    <p>Declassification review of the documents selected for publication was conducted by the
     Division of Historical Documents Review, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Department of State.
     The review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on
     National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
    <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the following
     categories, and whose disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national
     security, requires classification: <list>
      <label>1)</label>

     </list></p>
    <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information as is consistent
     with current requirements of national security and law. Declassification decisions entailed
     concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State,
     other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and appropriate foreign governments regarding
     specific documents of those governments.</p>

         this volume and for the companion microfiche publication was the Department of State’s
         indexed central files. Documents in classes 200 (protection of interests), 400 (trade
         relations), 500 (cultural relations), 600 (international relations), 700 (internal
         political and national defense affairs), 800 (internal economic and social affairs), and
         900 (communication, transportation, science) were searched for decimal combinations
         involving the principal countries of Lebanon and Jordan (country nos. 83A and 85), as well
         as related Middle Eastern country files such as Syria (no. 83), Israel (no. 84a), the
         United Arab Republic (no. 86b), and Iraq (no. 87). Files under the general Middle East
         number 80 also produced significant documentation.</p>

         visits); 110.11 through 110.15 (Department of State senior officials files); 123

      <p>2335. From Ambassador. I made courtesy call today on <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> and arranged presentation credentials President January 14.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d1fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> had just arrived in
        Beirut. He succeeded Ambassador <persName>Donald R. Heath</persName>, who left Lebanon on
        January 4.</note></p>
      <p>Foreign Minister launched into familiar pattern well known to Department of how long he had
       waited for concrete manifestation of a US policy toward Middle East. He said all he got was
       “the same stale old things”.</p>
      <p>I inquired if he regarded US assurances to assist free countries of Middle East to maintain
       their independence as either stale or old. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
       admitted he had received such assurances very recently from Secretary and Under
       Secretary.</p>
      <p>Minister then lamented incapacity of west to deal with danger of Communist subversion. He
       added Communists had perfected their techniques since 1948 and western world had done nothing
       about it.</p>
      <p>I rejoined that on basis of my recent observation in East Asia I could not completely agree
       with his analysis. I said Philippines were a brilliant example of a new country younger than
       Lebanon in terms of independence which had met an intensely dangerous internal Communist
       uprising with complete success and had put down subversion <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2"
        facs="0034"/>in a highly effective manner. I did not see why similar techniques if
       accompanied by resolution would not work elsewhere. I pointed to statement in my proposed
       address to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> quoting proverb “courage makes the
       heart great”.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> hastily averred present government was filled
       with resolution and bravery but did feel exceedingly anxious over threat from neighbors.
       Minister said, “We have reached conclusion there cannot exist on one side a pro-western
       Beirut and on other side a Soviet dominated Damascus”. He also said he had positive proof
       Egyptian and Syrian Governments were determined to overthrow present regime in Lebanon. When
       he lamented degree of Syrian subversion inside his country I asked why Lebanon could not try
       counter-subversion and he agreed that best defense is attack.</p>
      <p>Minister affirmed that reliance on US assurances was “rock upon which he stood” and left
       plain inference our assurances had in some cases not been followed by positive action. We
       believe he has in mind such requests as those for armored cars for gendarmérie and other
       items in countering subversion upon which as yet no US action has been taken.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d1fn4">In a January 8 memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of
        Staff took note of political unrest and subversion in Lebanon, which they felt was sponsored
        by “leftist, pro-Egyptian, radical nationalists in Lebanon, with probable outside Egyptian
        and Syrian support”. To help meet this threat, they recommended provision of military
        equipment, including armored cars, anti-aircraft guns, and a tank, to the Lebanese Army.

        microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>At conclusion of interview, <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he wanted long
       talk with me to discuss general US position in Middle East. He asked if I could see him next
       Tuesday afternoon following presentation of letters to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>.</p>
      <p>It seems to me if these Pirandello characters are in search of a policy we should give them
       one. I would suggest for Department’s consideration that at next interview I tell <persName

          Ambassador Heath observed, in telegram 2236 from Beirut, January 2, that the pro-Western
          government of Lebanon had, in effect, staked its political life on being able to obtain
          substantial additional aid from the United States. Heath urged that consideration be given
          to providing such aid, and noted that a refusal to discuss additional aid might bring
          about the downfall of the <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> government, and
          the emergence of a successor government which would likely not be pro-Western. (Department

         <p>Lebanon in forthcoming elections will face crisis in determining who will lead republic
          during the forthcoming critical years. In a country of such delicate balance and of such
          conflicting creeds and currents of ambition, leadership was of vital importance. Courage
          was first quality to be sought.</p></item>

          importance.</p></item>

        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Free World Cooperation within Lebanon to Meet Joint
           Problems:</hi></p>
         <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0036"/>
         <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> here mentioned hope US, <gloss
           target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and other free world elements would better coordinate
          their efforts, not only at top but particularly on working level in order to assure that
          all assets were lined up in joint effort against Communist and Soviet threat.</p></item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Psychological:</hi></p>
         <p>Minister referred to successful encroachment by Communism in Lebanese press and its
          increasing effect in Sidon, Beirut, Tripoli and Jordan. He was likewise worried about
          Communist attraction among intelligentsia. He said, “If you can capture minds of the fifty
          young men who will rule Lebanon in years to come, you will have made a real
         victory”.</p></item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In response to his reanalysis and to his once more reiterated complaint US had no policy in
       Middle East or, at least, since time of President’s last illness and advent of Sputniks had
       shown signs of vacillation, I said I had not discerned any weakening of resolve on our part
       to help free Arab nations remain free. Simply because a policy was simple did not mean it
       lacked vigor or that we lacked will to carry it out. Also, I did not feel it necessary to
       shout policy slogans from house tops in order to convince our friends where we stood.</p>
      <p>On Lebanese-American relations, I said matter of leadership was paramount. This was,
       however, an indigenous problem and one where Lebanese must help themselves, keeping in mind
       their own salvation from perils to be faced would primarily be by their own effort.</p>
      <p>On aid, I repeated substance paragraph 3 Deptel [<hi rend="italic">Embtel</hi>] 2335,<note
        n="4" xml:id="d2fn4"><ref target="#d1"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></ref></note> saying
       that so far as I was concerned, in a country such as Lebanon, aid would be primarily designed
       for its political impact both in and outside this country. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> concurred with enthusiasm, saying it was folly to concentrate on lifting
       up health standard or building roads if eventually Communists should take over country. He
       cautioned me, however, to be exceedingly discreet in revealing political motivation of our
       aid program lest it be misconstrued by our enemies. He suggested I confide directly to
       President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> my views on how our aid operation
       should be conducted and to let Prime Minister and a few select leaders know our intentions
       obliquely.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> concluded interview by a parable [garble]. He
       said he had had a talk with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, C-in-C,
       Lebanese Armed Forces, who, in casting about for solution of Lebanese problems, came up with
       astonishing assertion that “best thing for Lebanon would be to have a US High Commissioner”.
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said no one could have more patriotic motives
       than General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, but he felt deeply that strongest
       power of free world should take responsibility for formulation of policy and operations to
       achieve that policy in the Levant. With France a strong power, he would opt for a French
       leader in Lebanon, or, if British were <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0037"/>strong (and if he
       trusted them, which he did not), a Britisher. However, Americans were both honest and above
       all, strong. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> concluded his parable by saying he
       wished above all US policy would assume a bolder and more daring form, although Lebanon was
       ready to accept responsibility for running risks and for taking action which only native
       patriotic elements could undertake.</p>
      <p>I said I did not doubt American policy could be both imaginative and bold, but it would
       seek expression through indigenous elements and thus, in fact, the Lord might help those who
       [help] themselves.</p>

       <head>SUBJECT</head>
       <item>Forthcoming Presidential Election in the Lebanon</item>
      </list>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background</hi></p>
      <p>The Lebanese Constitution provides for a six year term for the Lebanese President and
       provides further that a President may not immediately succeed himself. President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s term of office will expire on September 22, 1958. In
       order for President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to succeed himself, the
       Constitution must be amended to that end during the regular Spring session of Parliament
       which will begin in March and end in May 1958.</p>
      <p>While there are indications that President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       may have decided to seek re-election, he has not so formally announced. On the basis of the
       information available to us, it appears more likely that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> has not yet made up his mind whether it would or would not be advisable
       for him to seek another term.</p>
      <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> probably would prefer for personal
       reasons to continue in power. He probably also believes that his pro-Western policies are
       likely to be endangered if he is succeeded by someone less forceful and less in command of
       the situation than he considers himself to be. At the same time, he is no doubt aware that a
       move on his <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0038"/>to amend the Constitution to permit his
       re-election would very likely intensify internal difficulties within the Lebanon and
       particularly invite increased agitation among the Moslems. He is doubtless aware that his
       opponents will receive strong financial and other backing from Syria, Egypt and the
       Communists.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether he commands the necessary two-thirds majority in the Parliament to
       amend the Constitution to permit his reelection. Our Embassy believes that he probably does
       have sufficient Parliamentary support although it is apparently not possible at this point to
       determine definitely whether this is so.</p>
      <p>As the leading foreign power in the Lebanon, the U.S. will inevitably be closely involved
       in and affected by the pre-election campaign and the election itself. We are closely
       associated in the Lebanese mind with the recent Lebanese Parliamentary election in which we
       played an active role. Failure to play an active role in the Presidential election would, I
       believe, probably have serious consequences in terms of stability within the Lebanon and
       could substantially affect the Lebanon’s political orientation. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of
        source text not declassified</hi>] That President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> is of the same opinion is evident in the fact that he himself discussed
       the matter somewhat obliquely with Ambassador Heath prior to the Ambassador’s departure for
       Jidda.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Problem</hi></p>
      <p>In order to assure the necessary coordination within the Government and perhaps with other
       foreign powers (I understand that the British are inclined to support a second term for
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>), I believe it necessary that we determine as
       soon as possible whether it is in our interest for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to try to succeed himself.</p>
      <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> has urged that a decision be
       reached in the near future. Whether <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should try
       for re-election depends, primarily, in our view on whether there is another sufficiently
       strong pro-Western candidate available who 1) could be counted on to maintain the Lebanon’s
       present pro-West orientation, 2) is acceptable to important segments of the Moslem as well as
       the Christian community, and 3) for whom broad support can be generated.</p>
      <p>If such a candidate can be found, we believe that it would be preferable for <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> not to try to succeed himself because of the risk of
       serious internal strife which such an attempt would almost inevitably produce. We are not in
       a position to determine with any accuracy what would be necessary to dissuade <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> from running and to persuade him to give his very
       considerable political support to another candidate. Presumably, we would wish to consider
       supporting him for some suitable position outside the government and indicating that we would
       be prepared to support him for the Presidency in 1964. I believe that our influence with
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is sufficient <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
        facs="0039"/>induce him to support another candidate, particularly if we are supported by
       the British. If we determine that it is not desirable for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to try for a second term, I believe that we should 1) have someone
       discuss this question in general terms with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and
       2) after a suitable lapse of time, inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> of
       our views and proposals.</p>
      <p>If a suitable replacement for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> cannot be
       found, then I believe that we should consider on an immediate basis 1) what steps we can take
       to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s position and 2) what advice we
       should give him regarding the manner of conducting his campaign, particularly the
       desirability of effecting a rapprochement with important anti-Communist, pro-West political
       leaders who, for a variety of reasons, are opposed to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s re-election. [<hi rend="italic">61/2 lines of source text not
        declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>The crux of the problem, as noted above, is whether or not there is available a suitable
       replacement for President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. There is attached,
       for discussion purposes, a list of individuals who either have indicated an intention to put

       level at which coordinated operational planning would be conducted might compromise the plan
       and jeopardize the U.S. position both in the United Nations and with the remainder of the
       Arab World. Accordingly, they consider that coordinated U.S.–U.K. operational planning should
       not be conducted at this time.</p>

      <p>2832. Time has now arrived for USG to make up its mind on attitude we should adopt in
       forthcoming Lebanese presidential campaign. Parliament will, between March 15 and May, have
       to dispose of question amending constitution if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       decides to run again; and elections will take place probably in July for a president to take
       office in September.</p>
      <p>Embdesps 399, 404 and 446<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Dated January 23, January 28, and
        February 14, respectively, these despatches assessed the impending election, the potential
        candidates for the presidency, and the views of the various embassies in Beirut on the
        presidential campaign. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/1–2358, 783A.00/1–2858, and
        783A.11/2–1458)</note> are pertinent.</p>
      <p>It is evident opposition to reelection of President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> can cause a great deal of trouble and possibly disrupt delicate balance
       in this country which exists by elaborate feat of political and confessional equilibrium. If
       menaces of opposition can be taken at face value, upshot of attempt by <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to succeed himself, even though crowned with immediate
       success, would result in Lebanon being divided not only on a Moslem versus Christian axis but
       on Maronite versus Maronite schism which would have effect of strengthening more fanatic
       Moslem factions in their anti-western bias and weakening elements friendly to US. Although
       external pressure of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> may <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11"
        facs="0043"/>force Christian sects into closer step, it may draw Moslem elements toward
       greater magnetic field of Arab unity. Effect of a second candidature by <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> will be divisive.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, however, is top dog. Opposition is united in
       hatred and fear of him, but seriously divided on who to select as a successful challenger to
       his power. There is no candidate cited in reference despatches who could defeat <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> with possible exception of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> who could muster backing of army, command sectors of
       Christian, confessional and Moslem vote, if only for reason this part of electorate opposes
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Even here, however, it seems probable
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could defeat <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> if it were a direct contest between the two men. <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, however, shows no interest in assuming presidential
       office. Bechara El-Khoury is another possible rival candidate with Moslem and Egyptian
       backing. However, he could be defeated by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</p>
      <p>If <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should decide not to amend constitution in
       order to rescind that provision (Article 49) that President may be reelected only after an
       interval of six years, and retire gracefully to quasi-private life, many of problems which
       now loom so menacingly would disappear. By permitting some other candidate to take over
       presidency, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could neatly finesse opposition not
       only in Lebanon but abroad; e.g., Egypt and Syria. His enemies, who have been strenuously
       beating on barrier of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s supposed personal
       ambition, would find themselves pushing against an open door and would almost certainly fall
       flat on their faces. It is clear that rivalries of various opposition candidates would serve
       to cancel each other out, and with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s control of
       Parliament he could almost at will assure election of his hand-picked successor. Here
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should exercise caution and skill in order
       charge not be made his successor was but a puppet.</p>
      <p>If, however, President utilizes his control of Parliament to amend constitution and succeed
       himself, it seems certain he will invite very extensive opposition on part of <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> which, if not successful in frustrating <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s election, will almost certainly cause grave discord
       inside Lebanon. There are already sufficient indigenous elements of discontent in opposition
       circles to provide ready fuel for any tinder which may be brought in from outside.</p>
      <p>From US foreign policy point of view we have delicate problem of not allowing disappearance
       of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> from presidential scene to be interpreted as
       a disavowal of his foreign policies including open support of US and <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine. Similarly, if he should decide to stand
       for re-election and trouble breaks out, we must seek to divorce his identity with policies we
       sponsor from his identity with domestic problems not of our concern. Chances are great,
       however, that an anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> campaign would turn into
       a fanatic anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>-cum-anti-US drive on part of
       certain elements of Moslem population and <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>those
        anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> Christians who would adopt a neutralist
       line in order to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Therefore, if
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> runs again we must see that he wins and wins
       handsomely.</p>
      <p>I recommend following course of action: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>That I be authorized initially to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> himself his views on re-election, stressing US appreciation for his
         friendship and for courageous leadership he has exerted in Arab world as champion of
         principles for which free world stands. We would tell <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> our interest in his own personal welfare is a continuing one, and we
         will expect his own influence to be exerted for maintenance of policies he has so
         effectively followed while in office. At same time we should ask if his analysis of
         situation suggests he can assure continuance of his policies through support of some other
         candidate for presidency. In that case we would hope, after interval of six years, that he
         would still be available to resume mandate as chief executive. If, however, it was
         President’s carefully matured opinion he should stand to succeed himself now, we would not
         oppose that decision.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Following such a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         himself, I be authorized to indicate to friendly chiefs of mission (cf. Embdesp 404) US
         views as outlined above. It is important that free world embassies do not back rival
         candidates.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>To Lebanese inquiry, we be authorized to state US traditional position is to refrain
         from intervening in internal political affairs of friendly foreign states, but that because
         of our continuing friendly regard for Lebanon we would hope elections would follow course
         designed to unite nation rather than divide it, and that they would produce a president
         well qualified to maintain Lebanon’s freedom and independence.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Something must be done for <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, the apostle of
         Americanism. In my judgment, he should go fairly soon as he is focusing anti-American
         opinion on himself and his eventual exit, unless expertly handled, might be misinterpreted
         as a disavowal of Lebanon’s pro-western policy. I recommend we go all out to secure
          <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s selection as president of next <gloss
          target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. This would satisfy requirement in Arab world to be loyal to
         one’s friends, would be immensely rewarding to <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
         himself and would strike cord of patriotic pride even in opposition elements of Lebanon. To
         gain maximum advantage, decision to support <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
         should be taken promptly and made known to him soon.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>As for actual candidates who could successfully serve as president and sustain a foreign
       policy acceptable to US interest, I would say that either of the Edde brothers—Raymond or
       Pierre—would provide excellent presidential material. <persName>Selim Lahoud</persName>,
       present Minister of Public Works, is a man of immense energy and keen intelligence, although
       he has little popular following and would generally be regarded as a <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> stooge. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> is too apolitical to have a foreign policy other than one of strict
       neutrality and, if elected president, would probably become a neutral legume who would
       require careful pruning to grow in the right direction. However, as was said of Louis XIV,
       “All he has is common sense—but a great deal of that”.</p>
      <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0045"/>
      <p>I believe we must act with promptness in facing this problem as otherwise by default we
       will find ourselves ranged tacitly on side of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       with no particular feeling of gratitude from him. If he runs we should derive benefits from
       his victory; his eventual defeat would be a disaster not only for him but for us. His
       continuance in office would not, however, be without cost. My own judgment is it would be
       best for Lebanon, for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and for United States if
       he stepped down from power now and resumed it six years in future.</p>

          >Supra.</hi></ref></note> I called on President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> this morning and made oral representation outlined paragraph 1 reference
       telegram. I said I had personally listened to some hundred or more Lebanese personalities,
       each with his own slant on presidential problem, but had kept my own counsel. My government
       agreed time had now come to ask <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself for his
       estimate of situation.</p>
      <p>President said that, although he “had not quite yet made up his mind”, he felt on balance
       he would have to stand for reelection.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> then went through process of elimination,
       ticking off one by one potential candidates. He said, of those who were outside Parliament,
       it was clear Joseph Hitti did not have sufficient following to be considered as successful
       candidate, nor did Jawad Boulos, a pleasant man with no political drawing power. General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was possibility, but there were two objections
       to him: (1) he did not want the office; (2) to bring military leader to presidency would
       establish dangerous precedent and might involve Lebanese army in politics in future. In fact,
       only candidate outside of Parliament who <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       thought might have serious chance as contender for presidency was Bechara El-Khoury. This he
       thought would be disaster for country as <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0047"/>Bechara
       El-Khoury had revealed during last term extent to which he and his family had profited by
       corruption and, furthermore, he had given himself too much to external forces outside
       Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Within Parliament, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> discussed prospects of two
       Edde brothers, Pierre and Raymond, indicating he thought neither could muster sufficient
       strength in Chamber to get elected. Another possibility was <persName>Selim Lahoud</persName>
       “but he had many enemies” and clearly, in <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       opinion, did not have sufficient votes to muster majority.</p>
      <p>Ergo, by this he came to conclusion only politician who could lead country and evaluate its
       present foreign policies was himself.</p>
      <p>I stressed our hope, because we wished to see Lebanon remain independent and because new
       currents were swirling in Arab world, that whatever happened in elections result would be to
       draw various elements in Lebanon into greater union and not to emphasize divisive
       possibilities which were latent in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>President said his own estimate of his popular strength was 90 percent of Christians, 60
       percent of Sunni Moslems. If this estimate is correct, it would mean his popular support
       would be 69 percent of population.</p>
      <p>I next inquired <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s opinion re chances of civil
       strife if he should succeed himself, recalling what had happened to Bechara El-Khoury, who
       had also changed Constitution and had been ousted from second term. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said conditions were different. Bechara El-Khoury had
       been discredited because of corruption, whereas his own regime could not be accused
       similarly. Although there might be troubles, he was calmly confident any disturbances could
       be handled, and seemed to have no fear of discord fomented from outside—e.g., Egyptian and
       Syrian.</p>
      <p>When I probed <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> re theory (cf. Embtel
        2893)<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">In telegram 2893 from Beirut, February 27, <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported on British Ambassador Middleton’s
        assessment of what he saw as the dangerous political situation in Lebanon. Middleton
        suggested that a compromise solution to the presidential problem might be to amend the
        constitution to extend <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s term by 2 years, to
        afford time to groom a suitable successor. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName> observed that Middleton’s proposed solution was based upon
        pragmatism rather than principle, but might mitigate the venom of a presidential campaign.
        (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/2–2758)</note> some compromise might be found
       by limiting new presidential term to 2 or 4 years, President was noncommital, but throughout
       our conversation referred to reelection in terms of six years.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, already envisaging second term in office,
       said he was quite prepared to be clement to opposition and he would be willing early on to
       indicate readiness to bury hatchet. He explicitly said he felt an opposition was essential to
       Lebanon and he would be glad to have members of opposition in new government.</p>

       said I had indicated to <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> my feeling means must be
       tailored to ends. It was my belief if there were riots or civil strife in Lebanon these
       should be put down by Lebanese themselves. It would be, in my opinion, prejudicial to
       Lebanon’s own interest if we should be asked to land Marines, as this would be portrayed in
       Arab world and elsewhere as subjection of Lebanon to an outside power. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> replied he was in complete agreement. He said only time
       he had discussed possibility of deploying Sixth Fleet was when Jordan not Lebanon was in
       danger. I am sure he got point I desired to make; namely, that US military strength in
       Mediterranean should not be used in forthcoming Lebanese political turmoil.</p>

        was instructed to tell <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> that it would be

        with hypothetical situations. (Department of State, Central Files, 684A.86/3–1558)</note> as
       latter afforded impressive reassurances continuing interest US in maintenance integrity and
       independence of Lebanon, irrespective of its internal political management. I read out
       numbered paragraphs Deptel 3626 textually and had no doubt <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> comprehended their meaning. He made no comment except to nod his head
       when I read paragraph 4. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> his estimate of situation which had
       led to such a request. He said re assurances authorized Deptel 3629 danger to Lebanon was
       less external than internal. He had proof arms were being smuggled by agents of <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to Lebanon through mountain defiles from Syrian border and by
       small boats to Tripoli and Sidon. He felt Christians would increasingly demand arms of their
       own to meet threat from Moslem population. However, from this point on <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for first time in my acquaintance showed confusion of
       thought as revealed in following anomalies: <list>
        <label>1)</label>
        <item>Although he claimed Syrian-Egyptian agents were smuggling in rifles, <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> admitted Moslems to whom these guns were given were in
         turn selling them to Christians for between 600 and 700 pounds. This does not add up to a
         very convincing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> inspired threat by Moslem element
         against Christian Lebanese.</item>
        <label>2)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he thought he would increase
         penalties (30 days to 3 years in jail) for unlawful possession of firearms to 3 years in
         jail as minimum, and in general would tighten up security measures against arms smuggling.
         At same time he smiled blandly at my question how arms he requested [<hi rend="italic">less
          than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] would be brought in, replying there were
         “ways and means" for clandestine introduction. In other words, while denouncing smuggling
         of arms for Moslem element, President of a supposedly united country seeks to connive at
         smuggling arms for Christian elements.</item>
        <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0051"/>
        <label>3)</label>
        <item>Asked for his estimate of degree of danger of civil war, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> hastily insisted a coup d’etat was “impossible”. He said, “I control
         most of Shiite Moslems and some of Sunnis in Beirut. Main danger is in Tripoli”.</item>
        <label>4)</label>
        <item>I observed if things went wrong arbiter of Lebanon’s fate in case of civil war would
         be General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. President made wry face and said
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was irresolute and weak. Yet, at same time
         he confessed <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had such a hold over loyalties
         of armed forces that if he were removed Army might break in two along Moslem-Christian
         lines of division. In other words, by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s own
         estimate <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is far stronger leader than he would
         like to admit. President lamented further anomaly that defense forces for which greater
         part of budget was spent could not in last analysis be relied on for defense against
         internal subversion.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>All of this adds up to confused picture and not edifying portrait of <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in a quandary. In consequence, I believe fairly cool
       assurances contained Deptel 3626 will have salutary influence. On request for arms [<hi
        rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] I do not believe we
       should accede. In fact, I told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> candidly my
       judgment that to arm rival factions in manner he suggested might conduce to an irreparable
       split in Lebanon between Moslems and Christians, with heightened danger UAR might truly take
       advantage of pretext to intervene on behalf of Moslem brethren. In my opinion a Lebanon which
       did not take into full account need for cooperation with Moslem population would become, so
       far as Arab world was concerned, a sort of Christian Israel beleaguered by its neighbors and
       incapable of sustaining itself except under guns of foreign warships.</p>

        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s listed alternatives before <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> are too categoric. On the basis of his estimate of situation, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> might neither be insubordinate or resign and leave
       country but merely claim to act as loyal subordinate of government, but to deplore his
       inability to deal with widespread guerrilla warfare and point to his other mission of
       defending country against external aggression. This would have political effect of handing
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s fate to decision of mob.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in his talk with me did not give
       impression of being out and out anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> as
       represented by <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>, in fact, seemed entirely impersonal, confining his appreciation to
       military situation and means he had to deal with it.</p>
      <p>As indicated Embassy telegram 3255,<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">Dated March 31. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/4–358)</note> I believe <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

       overthrow by violence. In this struggle within <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

      <p>In this very fifty-fifty situation, and with mounting evidence guns will shoot to kill, I
       am revising conclusions set out a month ago in Embassy telegram 2964<note n="8"
        xml:id="d12fn8"><ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> and am trending to judgment it
       would be better for Lebanon, US interests and Arab World generally, and <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself, if he stepped down at end of presidential term
       next September. This is based on reasoning (vide final paragraph Embassy telegram 3282 that
       if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is deposed by force pendulum would swing so
       widely away from West as to crash through the sides of the clock. I am likewise trending to
       opinion that Raymond Edde would be a competent and generally acceptable compromise candidate
       to replace <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, who would with less fanfare but
       with quiet effectiveness maintain a pro-Western policy conducive to our interests. However, I
       prefer to send in my final recommendations on these points after consultation early next week
       with French and British colleagues.</p>

      <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, President said, “everyone around
       me may collapse, but I shall be the last to collapse.” He depicted President as saying that
       if issue were merely internal political one of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       against his domestic followers, he would undertake struggle light-heartedly. However, it had
       become a contest in which massive outside forces were engaged, including those of <gloss

       merely to tell Edde Brothers, for example, US was friendly to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

        Beirut, April 22, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported that British
        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSG1">Middleton</persName> had information that President

      <p>I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_MSG1">Middleton</persName> that, since Lebanese in

       authorize him communicate with French Ambassador here, as well as with Quai d’Orsay.</p>

        <p>“US Ambassador and myself have reached agreement on following appraisal of present
         situation: <list>
          <item>“(A) <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is not so decided (as he was
           until recently) on standing again.</item>
          <item>“(B) He would be prepared to make way, however, for General <persName

          <item>“(C) General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is aware of this and of
           fact his election to succeed <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in such
           circumstances would be acceptable to Americans and ourselves as candidate most likely to
           ensure internal and external security for which we have given guarantees.</item>
          <item>“(D) No other candidate is at present seriously in field.</item>
          <item>“(E) General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has so far refused but
           has given indications he might be willing to be ’drafted’.</item>
          <item>“(F) Strong opposition to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
           re-election is being shown by great majority of Moslems and substantial fraction of
           Christians.</item>
          <item>“(G) Attempt to change constitution to enable <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
            >Chamoun</persName> to stand would probably be occasion for a trial of strength. We are
           not certain, however, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> can now command
           necessary two-thirds majority of total number of deputies to enable amendment to be
           passed in Chamber.</item>
          <item>“(H) We would not expect any such disturbances to get out of control as General
            <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has made it clear Army will use every
           endeavor to enforce law and order if necessary.</item>
          <item>“(I) <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is at moment probably weighing up
           advantages, personal and national, of forcing his re-election by whatever means against
           disadvantages of trying to govern a deeply divided country for <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25"
            facs="0057"/>another term of office. There is additional risk that, even if re-elected,
           he might be ousted before completing his full second term of office; in which case
           convention by which Lebanon has a Maronite president might be called in question.</item>
          <item>“(J) Our (the West’s) interests generally would probably be best served by <persName
            corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s re-election only if he commanded sufficient
           general support for his policies to be effectively implemented. They would probably be
           less well served by General in office (because his laziness and disinclination for the
           political game); and if he resigned in short time any likely successor (after perhaps a
           general election) would probably be less able to keep close bonds with West.</item>
         </list></p>
        <p>“We therefore must decide, in light of these considerations, whether to intervene now, or
         at all, in favor of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or General. It is by no
         means certain advice to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to stand down would
         be well taken; on other hand our encouragement of General might well prove decisive. On
         whole we consider situation must be allowed to clarify itself further before we act. If,
         for example, proposal for constitutional amendment fails then <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> ceases to be aid in openly encouraging General <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to fill vacuum. But we should avoid taking up now a
         position from which we may afterwards forced by circumstances to depart.”</p>

         Richards</persName>, to discuss the implications of the Eisenhower Doctrine. The communiqué
        defined common purposes shared by the United States and Lebanon. For text, see <hi
         rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 835–836.</note> In view of this discussion and of the fact
       that we attach such high value to our friendly relations with the Lebanon, I thought it might
       be useful to share with you a few thoughts on this question.</p>
      <p>The Middle East Resolution (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine) is
       until repealed a standing offer by the US—an offer to be accepted if and as Middle East
       nations so desire. It authorized the President within the limit of available appropriated
       funds to cooperate in the development of economic strength. It authorized the President to
       undertake military assistance programs with any nation of the area “desiring such
       assistance”, and in specific circumstances to come to the aid of a Middle East nation which
       might be the victim of aggression. The authority of the act is in no way dependent upon
       adherence by any other nation to the terms of the act or to US policy toward the Middle East
       area or any parts thereof.</p>
      <p>In the implementation of this Resolution, the United States has, I believe, been able to
       contribute significantly to the efforts of countries in the area to strengthen their security
       and safeguard their national integrity. The states which, like Lebanon, expressed
       satisfaction with the Resolution undertook no obligations as a result thereof. For example,
       as I wrote you on November 6, 1957,<note n="5" xml:id="d16fn5"><ref
         target="frus1955-57v13#pg_220"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol.
         XIII, pp. 220</ref>–<ref target="frus1955-57v13#pg_221">221</ref>.</note> Lebanon is not
       required to come to the assistance of the United States in the event of hostilities between
       the United States and any country. Neither is Lebanon committed to collaborate with the
       United States in the solution of specific problems affecting the Middle East. The
       relationship between us is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and our
       desire to see the Lebanon maintain its national independence and sovereignty and resist
       aggression, direct or indirect.</p>
      <p>We are not unaware of statements currently being made in the Lebanon to the effect that the
       relationship with the United States, insofar as it concerns the Joint Resolution, has come to
       involve some sort of a burden for the Lebanon in the present situation in the Near East. That
       this should be the case is furthest from our purposes and desires. We would not wish, I
       assure you, to be in any way responsible for a burden being placed upon a country with which
       we have such close and friendly relations and which we hold in such high regard. I <pb n="27"
        xml:id="pg_27" facs="0059"/>know that the Government and people of Lebanon will reach such
       decisions as they may deem appropriate in this matter, but I wanted you to have our views

       try to find some grant aid. He thought that it was much cheaper to try to hold the situation

        May 4, reported on a May 3 meeting among the U.S., British, and French Ambassadors to
        consider the political situation in Lebanon. In the final paragraph, <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> noted that the three ambassadors agreed to draft a
        joint appreciation of the situation and forward it to their governments for approval of the

       <item>Internal situation in Lebanon is likely to reach critical stage within the next week.
        After consultation with my American-French/French-British/American-British colleagues
        following is our joint appreciation for urgent consideration by our respective governments
        (my colleagues are reporting in identical terms).</item>
       <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0061"/>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item><p>(a) General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is clearly unwilling to
         accept presidential succession from hands of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         and thereby incur a political debt. Only if serious unrest threatens and no other solution
         seems possible might he be persuaded to stand; but it would be as an independent or
         opposition candidate. First alternative would have suited our interests but second
         alternative would necessarily represent a clear defeat for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>’s pro-western policy and is therefore undesirable.</p>
        <p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is in our view almost certain to seek
         amendment of constitution and stand for re-election. We know he has solicited and been
         promised active sympathy and support of Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Turkey and possibly other
         countries such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Italy, etc. His success or failure must
         therefore be judged in much wider context than mere internal Lebanese politics. Once he has
         announced his intentions western failure to support him will have repercussions among all
         most moderate and responsible friends and allies of west in <gloss target="#t_ME1"
          >ME</gloss> area. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has come to symbolize to
         them forces of resistance to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
        <p>(c) Parliamentary situation is uncertain but <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> can probably command necessary 2/3s majority for amendment of
         constitution and re-election. But opposition representation in Chamber of Deputies not
         proportional to its popular support and many Moslem and some Christian elements seem
         determined to mobilize their adherents outside Chamber and resort if necessary to extreme
         measures to frustrate <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Disorders must
         therefore be expected. Extent of danger this factor represents depends upon willingness of
         Army (i.e., General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>) to maintain order at all
         costs.</p>
        <p>(d) General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> mistrusts <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and is inclined to remain aloof in any civil conflict,
         which would inevitably tend to assume a communal character. But we consider he is first and
         foremost a loyal soldier and citizen and that declared policy of three western powers will
         be determinative in deciding his attitude.</p>
        <p>(e) President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has clearly indicated his
         final decision will be taken about May 7. He can then be expected to appeal to us for open
         support. Time will be very short as parliamentary measures for amendment of constitution
         and re-election could be forced through in a single session.</p></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>In our view optimum solution would be that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> should hand over presidential office to General <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> or to some other mutually agreed candidate. This now
        seems excluded. We are therefore likely to be faced with stark alternative of supporting
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or standing aloof. For reasons in paragraph
        2(b) above in particular we consider we shall have to support <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> despite known risks.</item>

      <p>3709. Copenhagen for Tosec. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> received me this
       morning. He said I was first man to whom he had communicated his decision to run again for
       presidency of Lebanon. He had appointment tomorrow with British Ambassador to whom he would
       give same word. He stressed special relationships he felt because of his policies between
       himself, US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said there were only two possible candidates
       for presidency who could carry on his foreign policy: himself and General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. However, latter had indicated his decision not to run
       (a statement somewhat at variance with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
       version reported Embtel 3700)<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">In telegram 3700 from Beirut, May 7,
         <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported on a conversation that morning
        with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> indicated that he had reached the conclusion that he would only accept
        the presidency if it were clear that no other leader could assure the safety of the state.
         (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.;</hi> included in the microfiche supplement)</note> and in any
       event might not be depended upon to stay the full course if elected. As for being steadfast
       in policy, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had seen other countries
       where once a slip was made it was impossible to foresee where one would wind up. For these
       reasons he was resolved to succeed himself.</p>
      <p>In light first paragraph Dulte 10, Copenhagen’s 3 sent Beirut<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3"
         ><ref target="#d19"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></ref></note> indicating concurrence of
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> and Laloy in basic policy decision to
       support <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, I revealed our tripartite
       conversations and joint recommendation, indicating that my British and French colleagues
       would presently speak for themselves in this regard.</p>
      <p>Having in mind Secretary’s comment (Dulte 10) on backing <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> wholeheartedly, I injected an extra dose of vitamins into <pb n="32"
        xml:id="pg_32" facs="0064"/>representation authorized Deptel 4173.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d20fn4">See <ref target="#d19fn2">footnote 2, <hi rend="italic"
        >supra</hi></ref>.</note> I also pointed out that so far back as early March (Embtel
        2964)<note n="5" xml:id="d20fn5"><ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> I had
       recommended we support <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, and was glad three
       governments were now in agreement on this issue. At same time, I stressed need for utmost
       discretion in manner of manifesting our support. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> said it would be fatal if our backing were overt.</p>
      <p>We agreed most immediate need is for three Ambassadors to approach <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and set him right as to three power support of <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and need for Commander-in-Chief Armed Forces to do his
       duty in maintaining internal security. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he
       had not yet determined date when he would undertake parliamentary steps for amendment of
       constitution, but thought we should see <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> early
       next week; say Monday or Tuesday. I summarized in part conversation with <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> earlier this morning, as reported Embtel 3700, with
       particular stress on my advice to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> he should not
       turn in his soldier suit at this time.</p>
      <p>As for other measures of covert assistance, President mentioned possibility of our speaking
       to the Edde brothers (cf paragraph 7–C Embtel 3673).<note n="6" xml:id="d20fn6">Paragraph 7–C
        of telegram 3673 from Beirut recommended following up on assurances of Western support for
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s reelection effort with “Other political
        efforts; e.g. a word to the Edde brothers.” This telegram is summarized in <ref
         target="#d18fn2">footnote 2, Document 18</ref>.</note> He then mentioned venal press of
       Beirut and extent to which it was bought up by Egyptian and Soviet money. He regretted
       western powers usually attempted to purchase papers already in Egyptian pay, neglecting more
       honest but poverty stricken papers which had refused to sell out to foreign influence.
       However, I pointed out need now was to secure foreign press support for <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> which would have maximum impact. President laughed
       ruefully [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
      <p>President also said he had been informed by police and gendarme commandants of need for
       standardization of weapons for mobile fighting forces. He mentioned BARS in this connection.
       I asked him to have his security people get in touch with their opposite numbers in the
       Embassy to see what requirements are and what we might be able to do.</p>
      <p>In his over-all estimate of security situation President said he thought Beirut would be
       relatively calm. In tribal areas of Chouf and Hermel he had already taken practical steps to
       divide populace, on theory there would be a de facto balance of power which would discourage
       uprisings. He thought (and here Druze leader Jumblat agrees) there would be a stand-off as
       between anti- and pro-Chamoun Druze factions. President thought there might be trouble in
       Tripoli, <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0065"/>but indicated he was taking measures to meet
       it by approaches to such Moslem leaders as Rachid Karami. He had no hope of being able to
       change views of other Moslem anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> protagonists
       such as <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> and Abdullah Yafi, former because of conviction and
       latter because of heavy Egyptian subsidies he receives for his newspaper <hi rend="italic">As
        Sayasah</hi>.</p>
      <p>President said, despite opposition of religious leaders such as Maronite Patriarch and
       Grand Mufti of Beirut, he had 90 percent of Christians on his side and a substantial Moslem
       support extending possibly to 65 percent of latter.</p>
      <p>This estimate we consider too high. He thought Druzes would cancel each other out, but if
       there were any majority it would be in his favor.</p>
      <p>Re attitude of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would continue his
       subventions to newspapers and politicians, while <persName>Syrians</persName> would continue
       sending of clandestine arms. However, he was inclined to agree with me there is as yet no
       evidence of a concerted <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> plan of campaign against
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> once his decision to stand for reelection is
       announced.</p>
      <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had not yet made up his mind
       as to date when Parliament would be called to act on amendment to constitution, he thought it
       would be very soon. He was waiting, however, until tempers had cooled before giving final go
       ahead signal. In response to my question, he said amendment of constitution would merely
       permit him to succeed himself. His present term would expire on September 23 and, if
       successful, he would take oath of office immediately thereafter for a second six-year
       term.</p>
      <p>At close of interview President produced from his wallet clipping of Alsop article re
       impact Lebanese elections on other pro-western leaders in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>,
       taken from <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> April 30.</p>
      <p>I said either Joe Alsop could have written joint appreciation of three Ambassadors or three
       Ambassadors could have written Alsop’s column.<note n="7" xml:id="d20fn7"><persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> also reported, in telegram 3710 from Beirut, May
        7, that he discussed the question of U.S. aid to Lebanon during this meeting with <persName

        indicated that, although the issue had become politically sensitive in Lebanon, he favored a

        xml:id="d21fn3">In telegram 3696 from Beirut, May 7, the Embassy reported that Beirut papers
        that day featured reports that the Lebanese cabinet had decided that Lebanon would renounce

        Lebanese Government intended to ask the United States for a total of $160 million over a

       affecting U.S. security, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen

        <p>“Turning to the situation in the Middle East, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
          >Dulles</persName> noted that the question of the Presidential succession in the Lebanon
         had now become very serious. If pro-Western President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> decided to run for re-election, it would require a Constitutional
         change. We don’t know that he has actually decided to run again, but that was the
         probability. Such a decision would be bound to cause internal difficulties which <persName

         amount desired was very far beyond the needs of Lebanon, and really constituted a kind of
         economic blackmail.” (Memorandum of discussion at the 365th Meeting of the National

         amend constitution this week, apparently on Monday. Under leadership of Rashid Karami,
          <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> and Abdullah Yafi, with acquiescence of third force and

          >Chamoun</persName>’s parliamentary play for reelection.</item>

        <item>Opposition met last night and formulated demand for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>’s instant resignation. They appointed Raymond Edde as a Maronite to
         carry this decision to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, which he did this
         morning. <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0068"/>However, Edde made clear to opposition and
          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> he and his national bloc would not support

         continue constitutionally in office until end of his term.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>As was to be expected, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> flatly turned
         down opposition demand for his resignation. He refused to be drawn out by Edde on question
         of reelection.</item>

        <item><persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>, Henri Pharaon and Raymond Edde then called on
         General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. Edde brothers are urging formula

         government of national coalition, headed by General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> himself. Despite unwritten agreement Prime Minister must always be a
         Sunni Moslem, he does say in this crisis Moslem leaders would accept a Maronite Prime
         Minister if it were <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, as they would believe
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s assumption of government responsibility
         would effectually spike any hope of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for
         reelection.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item>In response to direct question <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> told
         Edde, <persName corresp="#p_SS4">Salaam</persName> and Pharaon this morning sole cause of
         present revolutionary crisis in Lebanon is <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
         selfish determination to succeed himself in office. General explicitly disavowed any
         connection between foreign policies of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and
         his personal ambition again to be President. In other words, so far as <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is concerned issue is a straight personal one drawn
         between country and <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</item>
        <label>(6)</label>
        <item>General gave his interlocutories a very gloomy picture of security situation, pointing
         out country is now saturated with clandestine arms and threatened with imminent civil war.
         According to his latest intelligence, number of armed Druzes who have crossed from Syria is
         not 200, as reported Embtel 3769, but 300. He expects sabotage and guerrilla activity in
         the Chouf this afternoon.</item>
        <label>(7)</label>
        <item>General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> could not make up his mind on
         proposition of Raymond Edde that he take Prime Ministership, but showed strong reluctance
         to assume this responsibility which was clearly political and not military.</item>
        <label>(8)</label>
        <item>Edde brothers are now attempting to see <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         to persuade him to accept their formula. They say that if <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> agree country will
         return to a state of calm, all legal requirements, both constitutionally and otherwise,
         will be served; <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> will remain as President and
         Parliament can deal with issue of elections some time in July. (Practically, however, they
         feel issue of reelection of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would be
         killed.)</item>
        <label>(9)</label>
        <item>According to Eddes (and in this estimate we are prone to concur) time is exceedingly
         short. One ominous sign is Pharaon’s cancelling of afternoon races which will release a
         turbulent crowd in Beirut today with nothing to do but seek excitement. Edde brothers
         predict Moslem general strike in Beirut for certain tomorrow and are <pb n="37"
          xml:id="pg_37" facs="0069"/>undecided what attitude they and Phalangist Party should take
         on Christian shops remaining open. If Christians close, it will be taken as protestation
         against <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, but if shops stay open Moslems may
         start to riot against Christians and an out and out religious war may ensue.</item>
        <label>(10)</label>
        <item>In judgment of Raymond Edde, fighting will almost certainly commence in Beirut this
         evening unless a compromise solution is found. Beirut will probably be in full crisis
         tomorrow in that event, with perhaps open civil war to be expected on Tuesday<note n="4"
          xml:id="d23fn4">May 13.</note> when inflammatory press (now silenced by self-imposed
         strike) will start beating the torn toms.</item>
        <label>(11)</label>
        <item>I am endeavoring to consult with British and French Ambassadors this afternoon and
         shall use my own judgment on seeing <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> this evening. One may need suasion and the

       evening. He said Lebanon was at a most critical juncture and this was not a repetition of
       events in 1952. Now hostile foreign services were engaged. I had already heard of the 300
       armed partisans which had crossed frontier from Syria and I could be assured both Soviet and
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Embassies were working on a 24-hour basis to destroy
       integrity of Lebanon. Because of emergency, President had sent me a handwritten note asking
       “to send the twenty tanks by airlift with the ammunition”. This apparently was with reference
       to our offer to discuss with Lebanese military supply of 18 light tanks as authorized by
       recent Department telegrams. I said I had no idea where such equipment might be found or if
       it were available, but would pass on <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       request.</p>
      <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0070"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> then said he and President, thinking out loud,
       wondered if it would not be appropriate now to make forward planning for possible deployment

       said my instant reaction was that nothing could be more harmful to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

       <label>2.</label>
       <item>I said as General knew events in Lebanon had transcended local politics and would have
        effect far beyond frontiers of this country. I recited concern manifested by numerous
        governments in Middle East over continuance of policies personified by <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and recalled Arab fidelity to friendship. I said it was
        measured opinion of the three Western Governments whose advice <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> had so frequently importuned that best man to carry on these policies
        and to maintain independence of Lebanon for which three governments had pledged support was
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>General took this statement calmly and I was certain with his present limited mental
        focus he did not project our support beyond his own target date of standing loyal to
        President for his present term of office. I remarked upon this later to <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> who said he quite understood and thought it best that
        for present we work on <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in short term rather
        than long range. Both President and I agreed it was too much to expect <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to change his mind on question of <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s re-election.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>In <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s estimate tomorrow will be a
        difficult day in Beirut but he believes security dispositions can control situation. He said
        several times “day after tomorrow will be the critical one”. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> shared opinion of Edde brothers Christians would have a difficult
        decision to make whether or not to close their shops tomorrow, as officer responsible for
        security, he obviously hoped all stores would be closed, thus giving no pretext for Moslem
        attack on Christians. However President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> felt
        very strongly Christian stores should remain open tomorrow and try to carry on business as
        usual. President thought tomorrow would be critical day while as indicated above, General
        regards Tuesday as the touchstone. Both authorities amply warranted extensive security
        precautions taken by this Embassy.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>Re <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s request for 20 airlifted tanks, I
        pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> various practical difficulties
        which my ARMA indicated might lie in way. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said
        need for tanks would be a continuing one over next several months but he would be satisfied
        by delivery within next two weeks. General explicitly said he had sufficient trained
        personnel to man tanks. I later told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> we might
        have some difficulty and asked if an airlift was really necessary. President said no
        provided tanks were forthcoming.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>I told President when <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had asked us to think
        tentatively of landing “a division of Marines” in Lebanon this would work against <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s own interest. President very soberly replied that if
        Syrians invaded Lebanon in force as they might do in the Hermel he would feel constrained to
        send a personal appeal to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName>.</item>
       <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0072"/>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> I found General ready to make a
        good try at maintaining law and order in immediate future but that we would have to give him
        constant injections of resolution and courage if we were to go the whole course. President
        said he knew this but was deeply grateful for what I had done with General tonight.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>Greatest impression I gained on <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was to
        quote Field Marshal Slim, whom I had heard at NWC stating that for riot control human lives
        were saved by his policy of “one brick-one bullet”. At end of an hour’s interview I found
        General repeating as a sort of magic refrain—"une pierre-une balle”.</item>

      <p>3826. Rome for RLG and <gloss target="#t_COMSIXTHFLT1">COMSIXTHFLT</gloss>. As indicated
       Embtel 3820,<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">In telegram 3820 from Beirut, May 13, the Embassy
        reported Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName>’s concern about an
        apparent change of disposition on the part of the army. <persName corresp="#p_SS5"
         >Solh</persName> stated that he had received that morning a demand for the immediate
        resignation of President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> from the Army Chief
        of Staff, who was a cousin of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.
         <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> felt that the implication was that the army
        could not be relied upon to maintain order unless the government complied with the
        ultimatum. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> noted that he considered the
        situation to be “most ominous,” and added that he planned to discuss it with <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and with his British and French counterparts. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.;</hi> included in the microfiche supplement)</note><persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> saw three Ambassadors this morning. He said situation
       was “very grave” although not yet desperate. President said General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had told him this morning he could make a determination
       within next 24 hours to 48 hours on Army’s capability of maintaining upper hand. According to
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s run-down of military situation, Tripoli,
       Beirut and Saida are in complete Army control, but there is little other control elsewhere. A
       pitched battle continues at presidential summer palace of Beit Eddine between Junblat Druzes
       and gendarmes. President said, quoting <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, General
       fears a movement originating in Bekaa which will descend upon Beirut within 24 hours, but he
       is at present unable to assess magnitude of this development.</p>
      <p>President recounted clash at border post of Massna, leaving five Lebanese customs guards
       dead after a spirited resistance (cf. Damascus 2917 sent Department).<note n="3"
        xml:id="d27fn3">Dated May 13. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/5–1358)</note>
       President said aerial reconnaissance of Beit Eddine revealed attackers were using automatic
       weapons and grenade <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0074"/>throwers. Plane was hit by
       automatic fire but returned safely. He cited these incidents as further proof of an attack
       against Lebanon’s integrity by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he wished three Ambassadors separately
       to send following oral message to his chief of state: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>Situation in Lebanon is very grave and he wishes Chief of State to recall guarantees
         given to Lebanon through diplomatic channel for maintenance its integrity and independence.
         President wishes each Chief of State to consider possibility of landing armed forces in
         Lebanon within 24 hours after an appeal for such intervention by President of Lebanon or
          <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>.</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>In response to questions, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had not yet
       made up his mind to ask for foreign troops but would probably make a decision within next 24
       hours. If he did ask for friendly forces, this would mean their arrival in Lebanon not later
       than Thursday.</p>
      <p>I said, speaking purely personally and in no sense even implying US would send forces, that
       I was certain any US contingent would not place itself under orders of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. I wanted no doubt on this point, even in this very
       early stage. All Ambassadors agreed with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that
       if a request were made and affirmatively answered there would, of course, be complete
       coordination between the government, military authorities and friendly forces.</p>
      <p>I asked Prime Minister, who was present at meeting, re report set out Embtel 3820 saying
       that at this critical juncture we must know exactly where we stood with respect to loyalty of
       Lebanese armed forces. <persName>Sami Solh</persName> confirmed in part message sent through
       intermediary [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. He
       had received visit from Colonels Salem and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, but
       said they had not asked for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s resignation. They
       had however, he said, by inference implied that this was necessary. Contrary to report in
       Embtel 3820, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is not absent at Junieh but is at
       his headquarters in Beirut. French Ambassador saw General this morning and was told Army
       would stand loyal and do its utmost “so long as its endurance continues,” which he thought by
       implication meant that when troops were tired they might cease activity. Although French
       Ambassador would not say this to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, he told
        <persName corresp="#p_MSG1">Middleton</persName> and me privately that <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had said he thought a “political solution” was necessary
       within next 24 hours. Three Ambassadors concur <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       is vacillating and evidence from Army headquarters indicates high command has no stomach for
       going on much longer.</p>
      <p>We queried <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in event an airlift of troops
       should materialize if there were a safe drop zone at Khalde airport in Beirut and he said
       this area was under close military guard. He did not know if airport at Tripoli was in safe
       hands, although he had been told Lebanese Army was posted there.</p>
      <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0075"/>
      <p>All three Ambassadors suggested to President immediate need of making Lebanese case known
       to world press and for lifting of military censorship, which has thus far hampered filing of
       accurate reports.</p>
      <p>Three Ambassadors concurred in suggesting that, if President does ask for tripartite
       military intervention, a simultaneous appeal be made to Security Council to forestall charges
       from Communist side of “imperialist intervention”. I pointed out that under Article 52 of
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter right of collective measures in self-defense was
       preserved pending effective <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action.</p>
      <p>Three Ambassadors likewise urged that crisis of Lebanon transcends issue of presidential
       election. What is now at stake is national existence of Lebanon and not of any particular
       person. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he thoroughly concurred in this
       appraisal.</p>
      <p>Request immediate instructions as to readiness US provide emergency forces in event (as I
       think he will) <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> requests them. His response to
       my question re estimate of forces needed was “a very large division”.</p>

      <p>3832. Since decision on sending armed forces to Lebanon by three Western powers transcends
       local views, I have foreborne making recommendation pro or con. However, it is clear, as seen
       from Lebanon, that if we do send troops or make a naval demonstration immediate steps must be
       taken to forestall <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>/Soviet propaganda charge US and its
       friends are lining up against Moslem world. As indicated Embtel 3817<note n="2"
        xml:id="d28fn2">In telegram 3817 from Beirut, May 13, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName> reported on a meeting the previous day with <persName
         corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> and the British and French Ambassadors. <persName
         corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> reviewed evidence of foreign involvement in
        anti-government activities in Lebanon, raised the possibility of resort of the <gloss
         target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security Council, and asked what sort of aid the Lebanese
        Government could expect from the three powers which had guaranteed Lebanon’s independence
        and integrity. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> noted that in the course
        of the discussion he had made the point that, despite Syrian-Egyptian interference in
        Lebanon’s internal affairs, there was also an authentic indigenous element of opposition to
        President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> which could not be dismissed as
        “Nasserism.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.;</hi> included in the microfiche supplement)</note>
       there is a sufficient basis of genuine Lebanon antipathy for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s second tenure of office to provide a fertile seed bed for <pb n="44"
        xml:id="pg_44" facs="0076"/>charges Western “imperialist” powers are intervening in favor of
       one local politician against what would be represented as an authentic will of the
       people.</p>
      <p>I cannot, given degree to which events have moved, see how under any circumstances, even if
       order is restored in Lebanon, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> can have temerity
       to propose to continue six additional years in office after amending constitution. Political
       wounds inflicted in recent fighting in Tripoli, Beirut and elsewhere run deep because they
       are wounds in the body politic. They will not heal quickly.</p>
      <p>In my judgment it would be a capital political mistake to support <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s re-election if, in fact, we do forcefully intervene to
       maintain integrity and independence of Lebanon. By doing so we will be made to seem ranged
       against the Arab world in favor of a narrow Christian minority. We shall have achieved a
       military and political beachhead comparable to the potential one in Israel.</p>
      <p>These are advance thoughts projected for the Department’s rumination. My present feeling is
       that if we are called upon by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to land forces in
       Lebanon we should tell him straight out that this does not imply any further commitment to
       support him for reelection.<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">In telegram 3840 from Beirut, May 13,
         <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> added that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> was still the duly-elected President of Lebanon and had not been
        charged with crimes or misdemeanors. The call of opposition leaders for a general strike and
        resistance to the government was, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> felt,
        “purely and simply sedition and rebellion”. (Department of State, Central Files,

         target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note> from Beirut. He added his own comments concerning

        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">See <ref
         target="#d29"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> and later a message from Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> conveyed by Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">Not found.</note> informing
       him that the British Cabinet had considered the possibility of responding to President
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s request for military intervention, and that
       the Cabinet had decided that the United Kingdom should respond favorably, if the United
       States agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> had said the British would
       be prepared to do what they could although they assumed that the major responsibility would
       be American.</p>
      <p>The President thought it would be a great mistake if the French would participate in such a
       military intervention. The Secretary agreed, and said he had discussed the matter with the
       British who shared this view.</p>
      <p>The Secretary and the President discussed generally the problems involved in United States
       intervention. The President observed that it was well to consider such problems, but that we
       also had to take into account the apparently much larger problems which would arise if the
       Lebanese needed our intervention and we did not respond. The Secretary agreed, and said he
       had been giving thought to the mission of any forces which might be sent in. Perhaps our
       dispatch should be on the basis of protecting, at the request of the Lebanese Government,
       lives and property of United States citizens, and of assisting the Lebanese Government in
       connection with its military program.</p>
      <p>In response to the President’s question, the Secretary pointed out that he did not see how
       we could invoke the provisions of the Middle East Doctrine relating to the use of United
       States forces specifically, since that would entail a finding that the United Arab Republic
       had attacked Lebanon and that the United Arab Republic was under the control of international
       communism. The mission of the United States forces could be brought into context with the
       Middle East Doctrine at least to some extent, however, because of the Mansfield Amendment,
       which stated that the preservation of the independence and integrity of the nations of the
       Middle East was vital to the national interests and world peace. Nevertheless there was a
       question of constitutional authority to send in combat troops for a stated mission of
       fighting for Lebanese independence.</p>
      <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0079"/>
      <p>The President recalled our former so-called “gun boat policy” and asked by what authority
       we had sent such missions to South American countries. The Secretary responded that this
       policy in the world today no longer represented an acceptable practice, unless the forces
       went in at the invitation of the host government. Such an invitation, of course, was not a
       condition to the introduction of American forces at the time referred to by the
       President.</p>
      <p>The President was aware of considerable Congressional excitement over the Lebanese issue
       and what the United States proposed to do to help its friends in the Middle East. Senator
       Knowland in particular had raised this matter with him. He felt that resolute action should
       be taken as necessary to preserve the situation.</p>
      <p>In outlining the implications of the introduction of American forces, the Secretary
       mentioned the following: once our forces were in, it would not be easy to establish a basis
       upon which they could retire and leave behind an acceptable situation; the move might create
       a wave of anti-Western feeling in the Arab world comparable to that associated with the
       British and French military operation against Egypt, even though the circumstances were quite
       different; it was probable that oil pipelines would be cut in Syria; action by Egypt in
       connection with the Suez Canal was not predictable, but at least there was a strong
       possibility that the Canal would be closed to American and British shipping; the action might
       result in a new and major oil crisis. Another important consideration, the Secretary said,
       was that while we might get support initially from the Iraqi and Jordanian Governments, such
       support might lead to pressure upon them which could result in their collapse. The President
       thought that if it became necessary to move forces in, we should have our Ambassadors call on
       the various governments and explain that we had no intent other than helping a friendly
       government to maintain its sovereignty and independence; that the move was not in any way
       directed toward legitimate interests of other nations. The Secretary said that most of the
       Arab governments to which such representation might be [made?] had in fact asked us to give
       all necessary support to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. However, there was a
       problem in this case, that often arose in such matters, that the governments were prepared to
       say helpful things privately but not publicly. The President thought there would be a great
       advantage in having the Arab states join <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in
       asking for our help.</p>
      <p>The Secretary expressed the view that any communication to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> informing him of our willingness to intervene should make it clear that
       our purpose was not to back him for a second term as President. The President agreed, saying
       that we must know exactly what <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was asking help
       for.</p>
      <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0080"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out the necessity for making
       clear to the military forces whatever mission they might have. They would be fighting forces,
       and there should be no doubt in their minds what they would be called upon to do and the
       extent to which they were able to protect themselves, and, if necessary, be reinforced for
       that purpose.</p>
      <p>In commenting upon the President’s observation that it was difficult to see how we could
       afford not to respond to a properly worded request by President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> and the Lebanese Government if circumstances clearly showed that our aid
       was essential for the preservation of Lebanese independence, the Secretary reviewed current
       Communist methods of warfare throughout the world. He mentioned their tactics in Venezuela,
       Burma, Indonesia, Lebanon, etc., where they employed techniques of inciting rioting, which
       were techniques extremely difficult to combat. At least in the case of Lebanon, however,
       there might be an instance in which we could comply with a legitimate request and, operating
       “in accordance with rules of the game as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations”, do
       something constructive. If we did nothing, we would have to accept heavy losses not only in
       Lebanon but elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The President speculated upon the desirability of sending some sort of message to Congress
       setting forth an evaluation of the situation and asking specifically for authority to move in
       United States forces if they should be required. The Secretary recalled that even at the time
       the Middle East Resolution was being considered in Congress many members had said that the
       President already had authority to take military action to protect United States
       interests.</p>
      <p>The President said that at some stage we might give a report to the Congress of what we do.
       In it Congressional action would not be requested, that Congress would be given a full
       account of an important development affecting our security.</p>
      <p>The President concluded by saying that he thought it was right to let the Lebanese know
       that we would help them in case it should become necessary. He thought the military should
       immediately issue a warning order to our forces and put them on the alert.<note n="5"
        xml:id="d30fn5">Another memorandum of this conversation was prepared on May 15 by General
         <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>. According to <persName
         corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>’s account, there was further discussion concerning
        deployment of U.S. forces, and “the President indicated agreement that the Marines should
        start moving eastward.” When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> raised
        the question of a possible Soviet reaction, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName> responded that he did not consider a significant Soviet reaction
        likely if the military intervention was limited to Lebanon, but if U.S. forces were to
        attack Syria, “that would be something else again”. (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File,

      <p>4271. You are authorized to inform President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       orally as follows: The United States considers that the introduction of Western forces into
       Lebanon is a grave step which could have the most serious and far-reaching consequences and
       one which should not be lightly requested or other than under the most compelling necessity
       to meet a situation where the integrity of Lebanon is genuinely threatened and where its own
       forces do not suffice for protection.</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item><p>The U.S. is prepared upon appropriate request from President and <gloss
          target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> to send certain combat forces to Lebanon which would have the
         dual mission of (a) protecting American life and property and (b) assisting the <gloss
          target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> in its military program for the preservation of the
         independence and integrity of Lebanon which is vital to the national interests of the
         United States and to world peace. They would of course also be authorized to act in
         self-defense. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We believe these two courses are clearly
         within the President’s constitutional authority without further Congressional action but
         that the President is not authorized by Section 2 of the Joint Resolution<note n="2"
          xml:id="d31fn2">Reference is to the Middle East Resolution; see <ref target="#d16fn3"
           >footnote 3, Document 16</ref>.</note> to send armed forces to fight for Lebanon’s
         independence since there has not occurred “armed aggression from any country controlled by
         International Communism”.</p>
        <p>For these reasons the request should be couched in the terms indicated. Once the troops
         are there they would, in fact, serve to protect the independence of Lebanon. If for example
         they were stationed in Beirut and Tripoli to protect American life and property, that would
         presumably release Lebanese forces, and if the elements which were there to assist <gloss
          target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> in its military program became engaged in hostilities they
         would, acting in self-defense, counterattack.</p>
        <p>You may use the foregoing on your own authority to explain the underlying rationale of
         point one. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Steps are already being initiated to
         put substantial combat forces into readiness to respond promptly, but the date of their
         arrival could not be counted on before two or three days after request received.<note n="3"

       such a problem.<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5">Telegram 4278 to Beirut, May 13, noted that the

        Files, 783A.00/5–1358)</note> This aspect of the matter will of course have to be handled
       with great delicacy but also we believe with firmness. We see no reason why you and the
       British Ambassador should not inform your French colleague as to what you propose to do.
       Also, we believe that to avoid embarrassment you and your British colleague should make
       consecutive and not joint reply. Please keep in touch with your British colleague, who will

      <p>3869. I saw President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> at 10:45 and went over
       in very great detail four points set out Deptel 4271.<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2"><ref

        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> understood every word. His only comment when I indicated
       four points were interdependent was to say that on third item—support of Arab States in
       Lebanon’s appeal to US and Security Council—he could not regard this as a condition precedent
       as it was beyond his power to pledge action of other independent Arab countries. All the
       other points were matters strictly relating to himself, his government and the US. I said it
       was surely not intention of USG to make third point a condition for implementation of

      <p>As forecast Embtel 3863,<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName> reported on a meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> in telegram 3863 from Beirut, May 14. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName>’s assessment of the security situation in Lebanon was “much more
        reassuring, although Army was stretched to its utmost capability.” <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> concluded that the situation was currently under
        control. He added, however, that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had serious
        reservations about the impact on the Lebanese army of the possible introduction of foreign
        forces into Lebanon. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/5–1458; included in the
        microfiche supplement)</note> with improved security situation, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> is hopeful he will never need to request intervention by US or <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. However, he asked me to express his profound thanks for this
       immediate and impressive manifestation of US support.</p>
      <p>I mentioned our reservation re use of French forces. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> said he readily concurred and did not believe, as practical matter,
       French would be in position to send troops even if they wished to. However, he felt it
       necessary to make démarche to three Ambassadors yesterday, because France had given
       guarantees to Lebanon.</p>
      <p>I discussed leak reported last paragraph Embtel 3863 with President, expressing deep
       concern lest Osseiran utilize it to disadvantage of Western Powers and Lebanon. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had in Cabinet meeting yesterday merely informed
       government he had recalled with three Western Ambassadors guarantees their governments had
       severally given Lebanon. This would explain how <persName corresp="#p_EP2">Pierre
        Edde</persName> may have put his busy mind to work on possibility of foreign intervention.
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said Osseiran had reached similar conclusion
       by deduction. He concurred in my assessment of danger lest Osseiran resort to some
       unauthorized and stupid action. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said
       reflectively he thought Osseiran might get “sick.”</p>
      <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0084"/>
      <p>I gave President current list of members <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council

       have recourse to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, it commence diplomatic preparations with
       view to securing maximum support for its case. As for <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName>’s presentation of Lebanon’s case in his wandering press conference
       yesterday and what I regard as over-generalized protest to Cairo (Embtel 3862)<note n="4"
        xml:id="d32fn4">Telegram 3862 from Beirut, May 14, transmitted a translation of a protest
        note from Lebanon to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> concerning <gloss

        Embassy received a copy of the note from the Lebanese Foreign Ministry on <persName

        783A.00/5–1458; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> I urged that <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> be as specific and factual as possible. I said that my British
       colleague and I had discussed between ourselves possibility <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
        >GOL</gloss> might declare <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador Ghaleb persona non
       grata. Middleton would presently hand <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> names of
       three other members of Egyptian Embassy here [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
        text not declassified</hi>] more dangerous than Ghaleb himself. I pointed out I was offering
       this observation without instructions from my government and on an entirely personal basis,
       adding that to declare an Ambassador persona non grata did not mean breaking diplomatic
       relations. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said, however, he thought if this
       action were taken, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would break with Lebanon.</p>
      <p>In closing interview, President left no doubt his fullest comprehension numbered paragraph
       four Deptel 4271; and reiterated he hoped he would never have to ask for course of action
       outlined in that telegram.</p>

       they felt they are bound to hear of it and our relations are such if they heard from other
       means and had not heard from us voluntarily it would undermine their confidence in us. The
        <persName>Sec</persName> asked what they would say? C said addressing themselves to the

       we hoped no request would be made but did assure if it were we would do our best to respond

       only if some of these other Arab states were prepared to back it up. C agreed. The
        <persName>Sec</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> is against it
       because it would leak in exaggerated form that we had agreed to send troops to Lebanon and

       support any action we might take. The <persName>Sec</persName> said also to say we think it
       would be very unfortunate if the situation deteriorated to a point where it would be called
       for—it would create serious difficulties. Our response would be the lesser of two evils and

      <p>Legally constituted Government of Lebanon, a country which is friend of US, is currently

       circumstantial information that those engaged in this subversive effort in Lebanon are being
       aided by elements and arms from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory. US has for
       some time been committed to assist Lebanon to maintain its independence and integrity, and
       Lebanon has been reassured of this. There should be no doubt whatsoever that US intends to

        term. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> insisted, however, that there could be
        no thought of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s reelection. (<hi rend="italic"
         >Ibid.</hi>)</note> I conferred with British Ambassador who is now beginning to <pb n="56"
        xml:id="pg_56" facs="0088"/>share my conviction it is clearly outside realm of political
       possibility for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to think of succeeding himself
       for a second term as president. I likewise told <persName corresp="#p_MSG1"
        >Middleton</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> request three western
       ambassadors jointly intervene with President. <persName corresp="#p_MSG1"

       need of suggesting to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> he make some act of

      <p>At end of my talk with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> today as separately
        reported,<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Reference is to telegram 3948 from Beirut, May 16,
        which summarized a discussion of the security of the frontier with Israel. (Washington
        National Record Center, RG 84, Beirut Embassy Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1">FRC</gloss> 68
        A 5159, May 1, 1958–May 20, 1958; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> I said that
       despite seeming improvement in security situation and possibility not only of diplomatic help
       in Cairo and Security Council by Lebanon’s good friends, I could not blink [at] the fact that
       a basic cause of present civil war in Lebanon was conviction on part of many citizens, mostly
       Moslem, that Camille <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was determined to have
       second six years in office.</p>
      <p>President said he had never made any such statement. I agreed, but pointed out that since
       most of country thought he did want to succeed himself in office and half the country seemed
       so opposed to that concept as to resort to armed violence, this was a situation which became
       a political fact irrespective of technical written record.</p>
      <p>I then said, speaking purely personally and as a friend, that I did not see how the
       imminent risk of inter-communal fighting could be avoided if there were not some certain sign
       from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that he did not intend to amend
       constitution and get himself reelected. I was adamantly opposed to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> stepping down before end of his term and was opposed to government
       quitting under fire. I also was opposed to any indication that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> would be forced to renounce his constitutional rights or Parliament its
       constitutional authority under threat of civil war. This being said, however, I personally
       could not see how present threat to Lebanon as a state could long be prevented from becoming
       absolute unless there was some act of self-abnegation on the part of Camille <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</p>
      <p>President made no comment except to thank me very much.</p>
      <p>I made this purely personal approach with view to preparing way for possible tripartite or
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–US action if our governments so desire and on a basis
       which can be easily disavowed if that is the policy decision in Washington, London and
       (possibly) Paris.</p>

       following joint appreciation: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Three Ambassadors have met to appraise situation in light of subsequent events following
         joint submission outlined Embtel 3674.<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3"><ref target="#d18"
           >Document 18</ref>.</note></p>
        <p>Although it seems clear from General Chehab’s estimate of military situation today Army
         is in a fair measure of control and degree of foreign infiltration is less than Lebanese
         Government might wish us to believe, it nevertheless seems certain that unless a political
         solution is promptly found Lebanon may explode in communal Christian versus Moslem fighting
         within short time.</p>
        <p>Three Ambassadors feel that western governments have gone further than need to have been
         expected by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in his support. Governments have
         given him assurances which fully justify in concrete terms previous guarantees for
         Lebanon’s integrity and independence. The three governments have likewise gone all out in
         their attempt to provide <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself with
         political support.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the extent to which <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has
         been backed by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France and US, we now find ourselves
         facing a situation of civil war in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>We are agreed any political solution terminating present internecine hostilities must not
         involve capitulation of government to opposition. Any settlement should not involve
         accepting a change in either head of state or government in submission to insurrection. On
         former point, namely retention of head of state throughout his constitutional term, we are
         pleased to find General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is in firm
         agreement.</p>
        <p>Although commander in chief armed forces has requested three Ambassadors to intervene
         with President requesting him firmly to indicate his renunciation of intent to amend
         constitution and succeed himself, we feel it would suffice if three Ambassadors suggested
         to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that at this critical juncture where not
         his own personal fortune but safety of state itself is at stake, he should indicate by a
         change in government that, in fact, he does not intend to seek reelection.</p>
        <p>It would be our thought that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, without at
         once jettisoning <persName>Sami Solh</persName> as Prime Minister, could summon a cabinet
         of national union made up of <persName>Sami Solh</persName> as Prime Minister, with
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Minister of National Defense and a few
         other members, some taken from moderate opposition, the nature of this cabinet itself thus
         publicly proclaiming to all Lebanese the impossibility of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> seeking to change constitution. Such a cabinet would take office on
         one platform: <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0090"/>that question of presidential
         succession should be decided by the cabinet and parliament in accordance with existing
         constitutional procedure. Presence of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, to
         whom <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would have given private guarantees with
         our knowledge, would be necessary assurance of President’s decision not to run again.</p>
        <p>Such a formula would prevent opposition from crowing victory and would go far in our
         judgment to save face all round. It would then be essential for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> and other moderate politicians to decide upon a candidate for the
         presidency who would carry out pro-western policies of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>’s present regime.”<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">In telegram 4353 to
          Beirut, May 16, the Department of State responded to the recommendations in telegram
           3958:<p>“We are consulting with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> re recommendation in
           joint appreciation. We have not reached definite conclusions but our preliminary reaction
           is that while it might be desirable for three Ambassadors, speaking in name of their
           governments, separately to inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> of their
           concern over possibility development confessional strife and their belief that prompt
           political solution is necessary to avoid this, it would not be desirable for Ambassadors
           to make specific recommendations with regard to nature of such solution. We believe such
           approach would serve to put <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> on notice that
           three governments believe he should now take steps to remove principal cause of strife,
           without creating explicit impression US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France
           withdrawing the support they assured him of. View fact that troubles in Lebanon not yet
           over we believe it desirable <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s own morale
           and confidence be kept high as possible.” (Department of State, Central Files,

        Twining suggested to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> that <persName

        and the possible closing times, which could be about 24 hours after the word to go from
        Cyprus. General Picher informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> that it
        was the U.K. governmental position that for both political and military reasons the United
        States units should be first on the beach, and that therefore the controlling time was when

       <label>8.</label>
       <item>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> explained to Mr. <persName

        several countries and was in agreement with the State Department position that this was no
        time to ask any country for them. In case of U.S. action we would ignore the requirements.
        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> agreed with this position but cautioned
        against the use of Wheelus field in Libya, because of the uncertainty of the reaction of the
        Libyans. He further stated that Israeli bases would probably not be available, but was
        informed that overflight rights only were needed.</item>

       authority of the Lebanese Government. A subsidiary mission was to protect U.S. and British
       nationals and national interests. The concept of operations was limited to Lebanon and the
       use of the minimum force necessary to reestablish effective control over the country by the
       Lebanese Government. The initial objective of the operation was the Beirut area. The primary
       assumption of the plan was that U.S. Marines would secure a beachhead in the Beirut area as a
       base of operations, and British land forces would be deployed in the area thereafter. An
       alternative assumption was that the initial base of operations would be secured by a U.S.
       airborne battle group flown in from European bases, and again supported by a subsequent
       commitment of British land forces. (Telegram 162001Z from <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1"

      <p>A May 16 message from the Chairman of the British Chiefs of Staff to General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reiterated
       British support for the plan, but expressed concern that U.S. amphibious forces in the
       Mediterranean could not respond to a call for help from President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> in less than 48 hours, given the position of the Sixth Fleet. The
       British Government felt that it was important to bring U.S. airborne forces in Europe to a
       state of readiness to enable them to react quickly to an emergency situation in Lebanon. (The

      <p>The British Ambassador called at the Secretary’s request at his home at 4:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Following discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> letter,<note
        n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">Apparent reference to the May 9 letter from <persName

        see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958</hi>, pp.
        1386–1387.</note> the British Ambassador said he would like to bring up three points
       regarding the Lebanese situation.</p>
      <p>The first was the question of what the Ambassadors would be authorized to say to President
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> about his own personal position. In this
       connection he showed the Secretary a telegram from the British Ambassador at Baghdad, Sir
       Michael Wright, calling attention particularly to the opinion of King Feisal and Crown Prince
       Abdul-ilah that in the absence of an adequate alternative it was better to support <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for reelection even at the price of a civil war now,
       rather than having a civil war later under a weaker regime. Sir Harold indicated that British
       Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> agreed with this
       opinion. The Secretary said this view was persuasive; obviously if someone dependable were
       available to succeed <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, this would be the ideal
       solution. Lord Hood commented that we had tried to find another adequate candidate but had
       failed. The only possibility had seemed to be General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>, but he had proved unwilling.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3"><persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> confirmed <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName>’s reluctance in telegram 4012 from Beirut, May 18. In a conversation
        with <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> that morning, <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had expressed satisfaction with the success of the army
        in restoring order in Beirut, but added that he had no intention of agreeing to build on
        that success by accepting the prime ministership or the presidency. (Department of State,
        Central Files, 783A.00/5–1858)</note> The Secretary pointed out, however, that <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> opposed <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.
       The British Ambassador said that it was important, in any case, that we should at least not
       give <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> the impression that we were going</p>
      <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0094"/>
      <p>to pull the rug out from under him. If we could not decide now affirmatively to support
       him, at least he would not indicate that we had made a contrary decision.</p>
      <p>The British Ambassador’s second point related to what should be told <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> with respect to the military support the United States
       and the U.K. are prepared to give him. The Ambassador said that he had understood that we
       would give <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> rather full information on the first
       installment of help and say that more would follow as required. During this phase of the
       conversation, the Secretary consulted Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> by phone and indicated the latter felt that if we were too encouraging
       in what we said, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would be tempted to call our
       help forward rather than persevere in solving his own problem; that it might be better to
       leave him on the “anxious seat.”<note n="4" xml:id="d41fn4">This conversation was transcribed
        in the Secretary’s office. (Eisenhower Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
         >Dulles</persName> Papers, General Telephone Conversations; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> The Ambassador replied that the Foreign Office feels that it is important
       that the Ambassadors received discretionary authority to inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> at least the order of magnitude of the first installment—say 5000, in a
       proportion of 3 to 2—available within 24 hours. The Secretary indicated general agreement,
       but emphasized that the Ambassadors should not volunteer this information but produce it only
       if asked by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. The Ambassador agreed.</p>
      <p>After further discussion by phone with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName>, the Secretary told the Ambassador that the Department would send
       guidance tomorrow to our Ambassador at Beirut along the lines of this discussion, indicating
       that in absence of a satisfactory alternative we would not refuse our support to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He observed in this connection, however, that the
       French felt <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should get out.</p>
      <p>The Secretary went on to say that the Department would also get out instructions to our
       Ambassador tomorrow, after checking with the military, authorizing him to inform <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> of the order of magnitude of our support.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador then raised his third point as to whether we should encourage Lebanon to go
       to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> In reply to the Secretary’s question, Sir Harold
       said the telegram from Baghdad indicated that Iraq would support the Lebanese in the Security
       Council. The Secretary commented that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
        >Lodge</persName> was rather nervous about the adequacy of the evidence which would be
       available. The Secretary said he had replied that while the evidence was important the votes
       were more important. In this connection, he commented that while some evidence is not usable
       we know that the conspiracy exists on the part of the United Arab Republic to overthrow the
       government of Lebanon; consequently, if we have the votes we can, in good conscience,</p>
      <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0095"/>
      <p>support proceedings in the Security Council. However, the Secretary said that he had no
       present opinion as to the timing of possible action in the Security Council.</p>
      <p>The Secretary asked whether the Ambassadors in Beirut were working closely together. Sir
       Harold replied that they were indeed working closely together—but the trouble is they are all
       reaching the wrong conclusion. However, the answer to the question was that they were working
       together “admirably”. The Secretary commented that if they disagreed at least one of them
       would be right, and the interview concluded on this note.</p>

         <label>a.</label>
         <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> discussed the apparent
          differences with the British as to the circumstances under which U.S.–U.K. would
          intervene. From the outset the British have shown an enthusiastic attitude. They would
          like to see <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> informed that the U.S.–U.K. were
          prepared to move militarily. They have urged that the U.S. and U.K. Ambassadors be
          provided with the combined plan. They have proceeded with Iraq and Jordan to the limit of
          their agreement with U.S. The British are urging that Lebanon take its case against Syria
          to the United Nations.</item>
         <label>b.</label>
         <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> can see circumstances where the
          U.S. should intervene militarily to save the country but the current internal political
          situation is a powerful factor for staying out if possible. If we intervene the U.S. will
          be in the position of supporting the continuance of Chamoun in office against the present
          terms of the constitution <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0096"/>and possibly without Army
          support. The U.S. has good contact and good relations with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
           >Chehab</persName> who is pro-West. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> would
          not like to see the U.S. intervene in the present circumstances as it would be most
          damaging to our future influence in the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
           >Chehab</persName> would probably support a pro-West Christian for President.</item>
         <label>c.</label>
         <item>The problem is to “get off the hook” of one’s individual government. Mr. <persName
           corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> suggested the possibility of urging <persName
           corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to announce publicly that he puts the welfare of
          Lebanon above himself and looking to find a solution to the internal political problem.
          Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested the possibility of a
          postponement of the September elections or an extension of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName>’s term for one year.</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>The theme of the discussion was to find a solution for the internal political problem
          in Lebanon and to cool down the British on their enthusiasm for immediate action. The
          military now have the situation in the country fairly well under control but it still has
          great explosive potentialities.</item>
         <label>e.</label>
         <item>The urgent problem of providing a statement for the press at a 1200 conference was
           discussed.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Dulles’ comments concerning Lebanon and the

       <item>At 1200 the Secretary of State left and the meeting assembled in Mr. <persName
         corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s office. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
         >Herter</persName> had two points in connection with the Lebanese situation upon which a
        position must be taken. <list>
         <label>a.</label>
         <item>United Nations. The U.K. is pressing the U.S. to urge the Lebanese to take the case
          before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> immediately. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
           >Malik</persName>, the Lebanese representative at the U.N., has developed a series of
          points upon which the case could rest but the Department of State has not seen the
          documentation of these points. The U.S. feels that the case must be airtight before it is
          presented and it is doubtful if such a case can be made. There are disadvantages for
          Lebanon to take a case against another Arab nation before a non-Arab body such as the
           <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> At the present time the disadvantages of taking the
          case to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> seem to outweigh the advantages and it is
          presently planned that the U.S. will sit tight and take a neutral attitude. State
          considers it undesirable for the case to be presented. State will endeavor to discourage
          the British and Lebanese from pushing it.</item>

         <label>b.</label>
         <item>The second and more difficult point was what to do in Lebanon. It was quickly
          concluded that we should deemphasize the prospect of military action and play down
          military preparations. The problem of continued readiness over a long period was
          mentioned.</item>

            target="#d38fn4">footnote 4, Document 38</ref>.</note> was discussed. This message
          states that consultations are being held with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and that
          preliminary reaction is that Ambassadors might inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> of their concern over the possible development of confessional strife
          and that a prompt political solution is necessary to avoid this. Such an approach would
          serve to put <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> on notice that he should take
          steps to remove the principal cause of strife without withdrawing the support which has
          been assured him.</item>
         <label>d.</label>
         <item>The necessity of maintaining <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s morale
          and confidence in face of further trouble was mentioned. “We can not deal <persName
           corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> out.” If there is to be civil war we had better have
           <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in. The Army would probably support
           <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in such circumstances at least until
          elections.</item>
         <label>e.</label>
         <item>It was agreed that efforts must be made to induce <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> to find a solution to the internal political problem without reducing
          his strength in the present situation. Alternate means were mentioned but it appeared that
          he should not be given a selection of solutions but should be left to come up with a
          solution on his own. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> was to draft
          appropriate instructions.</item>
         <label>f.</label>
         <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated that the Syrians are
          anxious to move and have a tremendous amount of hardware collected and ready to move into
          Lebanon. However, he doubted that they would openly deploy military forces into Lebanon.
          They will continue their infiltration tactics into the country. It was felt that they have
          pretty free access from Syria into Northern Lebanon.</item>
         <label>g.</label>
         <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that overflight and
          staging rights would be required in case of military action. The messages that have been
          prepared to send to our Ambassadors on execution were mentioned. Admiral <persName
           corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> stated that <persName>Wheelus</persName> was not
          essential. “You send the messages, we send the planes.”</item>

         Document 38</ref>.</note> We have agreed with British, and British tell us French concur,
       re following approach to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> which should be made
       separately by three Ambassadors in Beirut. You authorized concert with your <gloss

       proposed course. Approach to be as follows:</p>
      <p>We are very concerned danger of civil war in Lebanon, with its possibilities of
       interference from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and have been considering, as
       President no doubt also has, whether anything can be done to avert it. We would be grateful
       for President’s views. One possibility would be to broaden government and we wonder whether
       President has considered this.</p>
      <p>If, but only if, President replies that broader government would not be possible without
       his renouncing a second term, you should say that this of course matter for him to judge but
       it seems to us really important thing is to insure continuous existence of a genuinely
       independent Lebanon and the continuation of the pro-Western policies which he has done so
       much to establish and which we believe are in the true interests of Lebanon.</p>
      <p>We would appreciate your views on following:</p>
      <p>Does <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> at moment believe that political
       solution is urgent?</p>

        would abandon any thought of reelection. (Department of State, Central Files,

      <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0100"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> listened to discussion re our basic intent
       with close attention and expressed appreciation but mention of Lebanon raised storm clouds
       since he had apparently just been given ticker report of statements attributed to Deputy
       Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> and Director <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> (whom he seemed have confused with Director
        <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName>) in closed hearings of Senate Foreign
       Relations Committee. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> coupled these statements
       with others emanating from London and Paris as part of deliberate build-up in preparation for
       some unknown conspiratorial action. He also strenuously objected to portions of statements
       (unavailable to Embassy) which by implication or otherwise gave the impression that <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was working with Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> said that in circumstances he would have no recourse but to react to
       these charges. I tried calm him down and he seemed respond somewhat but difficult know
       whether effect will last.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> then launched into tendentious discussion of
       Lebanese situation per se. Unpredictable problems were always arising in <gloss
        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and he said <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> unavoidably
       becomes involved. He had heard of Lebanese situation by radio in Moscow and had called
       Marshal Amer to warn against becoming involved until his return, at which time he felt that
       publicity was one-sided and unfair and had ordered that opposition side of story should be
       told, including statements of opposition leaders; while at same time denying alleged <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> involvement. How was it possible to maintain that opposition
       was wrong when it included all former Prime Ministers except <persName corresp="#p_SS5"
        >Solh</persName>, two of three Speakers of Parliament, former President Khoury, the Maronite
       Patriarch, and leaders such as Jumblatt and Frangie? Was there one of these opposition
       leaders who was not pro-Western? How could they all be wrong and just <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> right?
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> seemed intent on following course which would
       eventually lead to war between Moslems and Christians than which nothing could be worse. Why
       did we insist on backing <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in these circumstances
       while putting him (<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>) in position of being tied
       up with Russians? Greatest mistake of USG in Middle East was that it failed understand that
       basic fact of life in area is that people are tired of being exploited. Why did we continue
       support leaders who were out of sympathy with people? <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> admitted that he sometimes acted in rather high-handed manner, such as
       when he ruled that some people could stand for election and others</p>
      <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0101"/>
      <p>could not. This was obviously not democratic but people approved because they were
       convinced he was acting in their interest; that was reason they supported him.</p>
      <p>As far as alleged <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> involvement in Lebanon was concerned,
       he denied such the case and would be interested in any evidence that could be produced to
       contrary. It was of course possible that there might have been some crossing of border by
       persons, especially Druses, and some arms smuggling but <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
       had nothing to do with it. There is always tendency assume Egypt has greater capability than
       it has. Did I know how much its total budget for intelligence was? Only 1 million pounds.
       What could you do with that?</p>
      <p>Except for a few interruptions to endeavor keep record somewhere near straight, I allowed
       this somewhat incoherent tempest run its course and then observed that, regardless of
       incidental details, I had impression that both of us interested in seeing Lebanese situation
       settled quietly and prevented from developing more seriously. Was that correct? Yes, said
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but there is now stalemate and difficult see
       what could be done. I said repeating difficulties would get us nowhere. How about thinking
       instead in terms of settlement?</p>
      <p>Much to my surprise, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s whole attitude changed
       at this point. He said had heard of plan to replace <persName corresp="#p_SS5"
        >Solh</persName> [with?] <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Prime Minister
       which seemed reasonable to him and he did not know why it had been refused. In fact he did
       not understand exactly what opposition really wanted but in his opinion settlement might be
       worked out somewhat along following lines: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>An amnesty for opposition. This is of first importance because greatest preoccupation
         of opposition leaders in that they will be court-martialed and, as long as there is
         prospect that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> will take his revenge, they
         obviously will not talk of settlement.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>General <persName>Shehab</persName> to become Prime Minister since he is respected and
         enjoys confidence of both Christians and Moslems.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to disclaim intention to seek change
         constitution but to serve out term. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said
         understood opposition insisting on his resigning now but this would obviously present
         complications and he saw no reason for insisting on this provided there was fully
         guaranteed amnesty.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Possibly have new elections.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said that he sincerely wished be helpful and
       would be glad to attempt use his influence with opposition leaders in effort obtain their
       assent to any formula on which we might agree. He also suggested Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> might be able get in discreet touch with
        <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he
       would be glad see me at any time in event I had any ideas. He added unfortunate several days
       had already been lost while attention devoted entirely to refutation of charges of <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> complicity.</p>
      <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0102"/>
      <p>Although I am still somewhat mystified by this sudden change of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> from the tendentious and querulous to thoughtful and reasonable (a change
       which was also reflected in his entire manner), I feel that we may have struck lead which can
       be profitably pursued. If so, it would surely be preferable do so rather than have case go to
       Security Council where it could hardly fail to degenerate into a propaganda battle between
       Lebanon backed by West and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> backed by <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Perhaps this is <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s worry since recurrent theme of conversation was his aversion to being

      <p>Suggest Embassy Beirut may wish comment.</p>

      <p>At the British Embassy I spoke to the British Ambassador, saying I wanted to do so in the
       most private and confidential way. I thought I should warn him that some of our people, not
       just in Washington but elsewhere, had the impression that we were being crowded by our
       British colleagues into intervention in Lebanon. I emphasized that we regarded this as merely
       the lesser of two evils, each of which was very great, and that our ardent hope was to avoid
       any military intervention. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> rather indignantly
       denied that that was their purpose. He said that all they wanted to do was to plan against
       the contingency, and that our people seemed indisposed even to sit down with them for
       planning purposes.</p>
      <p>I urged that the British people involved with us in this operation should be quite clear as
       to the basic policy involved.</p>

      <head>46. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on May 22 on significant world developments
       affecting United States security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered
       the following assessment of developments in Lebanon: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“As for the situation in Lebanon, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
          Dulles</persName>, the reports regarding internal developments were not very encouraging.
         While Beirut was fairly quiet, <persName>Tripoli</persName> was still a standoff between
         the Army and the rebels. The Syrian border was still wide open, and there was a steady
         infiltration of Syrians. Thus the situation had shown no improvement in the last few days.
         The forces available to the government in Lebanon were quite small. There were 9000 men in
         the Army and 2500 in the gendarmérie.</p>
        <p>“The Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, has been busy
         dabbling in politics, and last night tried and failed to form a Cabinet. With respect to
         the struggle over a possible second term for President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was by all odds the strongest man among a
         pretty weak lot of Lebanese politicians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
         felt that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would probably agree not to be a
         candidate again for the Presidency if he could be assured of a strongly pro-Western
         substitute for himself. Otherwise, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> felt that
         Lebanon would be lost to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
        <p>“There was a good deal of political maneuvering going on in characteristic Near Eastern
         fashion. Some reports indicated that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was
         favoring the candidacy of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> for the Presidency
         of Lebanon. If true, this should give us some significant second thoughts as to the
         desirability of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as an alternate to <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for the Presidency of Lebanon.” (Memorandum of

      <p>Situation seems to be rapidly disintegrating. I feel possible means of relieving tension
       and of at last removing albatross of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       reelection from everyone’s neck would be for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       forthwith to announce that he does not intend to amend the constitution or seek to succeed
       himself. He could then call for Cabinet of National Unity under <persName>Sami</persName>
       Solh to carry on and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> could issue order of the
       day insisting that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> remain until September
       23.</p>
      <p>Middleton agrees with this course but has explicit orders from <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Selwyn Lloyd</persName> to continue support for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> unless some reliable alternative can be found. It looks as if there is a
       divergence of view between British Government and possibly French and ourselves on all-out
       support of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to bitter end.</p>
      <p>Middleton and I concur conditions for introduction of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–US
       forces in Lebanon are distinctly not propitious. There are no foreign forces engaged which
       can be easily identified and our troops would find themselves fighting Lebanese once they

      <head>48. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>On May 22, <persName corresp="#p_AK2">Karim Azkoul</persName>, Permanent Representative of
       Lebanon to the United Nations, addressed a letter to the President of the Security Council in
       which he asked, upon instructions from his government, for an urgent meeting of the Council
       to consider a complaint by Lebanon concerning intervention by the United Arab Republic in the
       internal affairs of Lebanon. (U.N. Doc. S/4007, May 23, 1958) Telegram 4138 from Beirut, May
       22, reported that the Lebanese Government had voted to submit the complaint to the United
       Nations but that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> expressed the
       hope that the Security Council would not take up the matter for a few days. A similar
       complaint had <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0105"/>been submitted to the Arab League, and
       he wanted the League to have an opportunity to consider the problem before it came up in the
       United Nations. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/5–2258) On May 23, the
       Department of State sent instructions to the U.S. Mission at the United Nations concerning
       the Lebanese complaint. The instructions, which were approved by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName>, defined U.S. objectives as providing and developing support for the
       Lebanese case in the Council, and demonstrating through such support U.S. determination to
       ensure the integrity and independence of Lebanon. References to the United Arab Republic,
       however, were to be made in terms of regret over actions rather than “bitter direct attacks.”
       The U.S. Delegation was to follow the Lebanese lead in the timing and development of the case
       in the Security Council, but was instructed to encourage the Lebanese to present “as airtight
       case as possible.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 330/5–2358)</p>

      <p>4482. We share your deep concern over dangerous effects of continuing political stalemate
       and specifically re likelihood that initiative may pass to opposition and that when this
       occurs <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> may seek to play what he may consider
       his trump card of foreign military intervention.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">In telegram 4151
        from Beirut, May 23, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported on a
        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> which reinforced <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>’s conclusion that a dangerous stalemate existed in
        the wake of the failure to establish a consensus government around <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Prime Minister. Given the stalemate, <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> felt the “only course” was for him to work with
        the British Ambassador to help promote a prompt solution. The danger he saw was that “as
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s position crystalizes, particularly under
        impact of Security Council debate, he may seek to cash in on blank checks we, British and
        French have issued.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.;</hi> included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> We understand from British that you and Middleton were to see <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> today and believe that you may already have taken
       opportunity to recall to him one of conditions stipulated in connection with our statement re
       sending US forces, i.e., that crisis transcends issue of presidential election or future of
       any particular person and that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> will not push
       his candidacy should this appear seriously to divide support which should be counted upon to
       preserve <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0106"/>integrity and Western orientation of Lebanon.
       We also said we considered that Western forces should not be lightly requested or other than
       under most compelling necessity to meet a situation where integrity of Lebanon is genuinely
       threatened and where its own forces do not suffice for protection. We believe you should make
       clear to President we have of course assumed in above circumstances Lebanese security forces
       would be exerting maximum effort to defend independence of Lebanon. He should be under no
       misapprehension that US forces can be counted upon to intervene in circumstances where
       Lebanese forces are unwilling to fight.</p>
      <p>We think you should in manner which you believe will be least likely adversely affect
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s attitude, yet which will leave him in no
       doubt our concern, make clear to him that he does not have blank check re sending of Western
       forces. He should be disabused of any confidence he may have that he can refrain from taking
       decisive action to dissolve continuing political problem because he can count upon foreign
       forces to back him against domestic opposition.</p>

          >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> arrived after three Ambassadors saw <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> at Palace 10 p.m. yesterday. We felt in view of increased gravity of
       situation we could not delay expressing to President our concern along line identical with
       those sent out Department’s 4482. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> took this
       tripartite reception harshly. He commenced by saying three Ambassadors seemed more unquiet
       than himself and made a pointed reference to character of guerrilla warfare as exemplified in
       Algeria and Cyprus. At several points in a very lengthy interview he asked if we were trying
       to “turn the knife in the wound”. Re his stand on re-election he stated flatly this was
       completely out of the picture but when asked why he could not indicate that fact more openly
       to Lebanese, he said “if I did so my Christian supporters would cease their resistance”. This
       statement we interpreted as the final</p>
      <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0107"/>
      <p>rationalization of a hard-pressed, stubborn and desperate man who will not admit to himself
       that one of the root causes of his difficulty has been his refusal to clarify issue of
       re-election.</p>
      <p>When Ambassadors deplored fact leaders of rebellion in Lebanon continue to go scot-free and
       even hold international press conferences, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said
       “something” must be done; but it was very clear “something” could not be done without more
       wholehearted concurrence of army and its leader General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>President said he had confronted General that evening with a demand for a detailed plan of
       campaign to put an end to insurrection. He is to meet at 9 a.m. today with <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to examine this plan of action.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d50fn3">The three Ambassadors found <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in
        a more relaxed mood following his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
        the next morning. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> apologized for the
        atmosphere of the previous night’s meeting and indicated that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> seemed resolved to pursue a campaign against the insurgents
        aggressively. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/5–2458)</note> Although President
       repeatedly said that under constitution he was Commander in Chief, it was clear real
       authority armed forces rests with General.</p>
      <p>President gave no indication of any readiness to find political formula or to change
       government. He interpreted resignation of two Shiite Ministers as due to personal cowardice
       rather than from pressure from Moslem community. This explanation we took with grain of
       salt.</p>
      <p>We expect to see <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> again this morning after his
       climactic interview with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. After that I
       imagine I shall have to resume my almost daily pilgrimage to Junieh to find out where General
       stands. On balance, although last night’s interview was unpleasant for all concerned it did
       achieve purpose Department 4482.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">In telegram 4225 from Beirut, May

      <p>3223. Now that Lebanese Government has publicly pledged that it will not be party to any
       attempt to amend constitution<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">On May 27, Lebanese Prime Minister
         <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> read a statement over Radio Beirut in which he
        pledged that the <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> government would not
        introduce an amendment to the constitution to permit reelection of the president to a second
        consecutive term of office. (Telegram 4272 from Beirut, May 27; <hi rend="italic"
         >ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/5–2758)</note> we believe that central issue in Lebanese crisis,
       possibility of second term for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, has been
       removed and that every effort should be made to facilitate restoration of quiet and order. We
       think that this might be propitious moment for you to have another conversation with
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> concerning Lebanese situation, with particular
       reference to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s expressed desire to use his
       influence with opposition leaders in helpful manner (Embtel 3029).<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3"
         ><ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note> In order however to minimize to greatest
       extent possible impression which we would consider highly undesirable, that US negotiating
       with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> a solution of Lebanese crisis, we believe
       that you should state your initiative is on purely personal basis and not under
       instruction.</p>
      <p>We suggest that you recall to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> fact that he
       said he sincerely wished to be helpful re Lebanon and would be glad attempt use his influence
       with opposition leaders, and also expressed view that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> should serve his full term. You could say that now <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> has publicly pledged itself not to seek amendment of
       constitution, central issue in crisis would appear to be out of way and it would be very
       helpful if Lebanese opposition were to react in constructive manner by taking steps to lessen
       tensions prevailing in Lebanon. Specifically <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       might wish use his influence to dissuade opposition from continuing to demand resignation of
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> before his term expires. According to Lebanese
       Constitution presidential elections can be held as early as July 23, and you hope <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agrees that political developments in Lebanon should be
       permitted to transpire according to normal constitutional processes.</p>
      <p>You might add that if insurrection in Lebanon continues now that central internal political
       issue had been removed and especially if insurrection is encouraged and supported from
       outside it will in your judgment be increasingly difficult for anyone to sustain view that
       Lebanese crisis is purely internal matter. Would seem likely that more and more observers
       would come to conclusion that what was being</p>
      <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>
      <p>aimed at was not solution of a domestic problem but the undermining and destruction of
       Lebanese independence and sovereignty. As <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> knows
       US is pledged to assist Lebanon to defend its integrity, and we remain determined to do
       so.</p>
      <p>You should make clear that you have not come to bargain with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> but merely to take him up on his statement that he would be glad to see
       you at any time you had any ideas about Lebanon. You come in the belief that a propitious
       moment had arrived for constructive action in the interests of restoration of tranquility and
       order in Lebanon and of strengthening stability of the Middle East. You hope that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will agree and that he will wish to take immediate steps
       to persuade Lebanese opposition to match step taken by Government.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> probably will refer to his previous argument
       that amnesty for opposition is prerequisite to settlement. This we could not advocate and you
       should not even on a personal basis encourage <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       in this regard. You might say however if this subject comes up, that opposition should have
       much less concern about possible revenge by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in
       view of unlikelihood of second term for President.</p>
      <p>With regard to possibility of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Prime
       Minister you might, if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> raises this, express
       view on basis information you have received that General appears not interested but that if
       he were would probably be possible work something out.</p>

      <head>53. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on May 29 on significant world developments
       affecting U.S. security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> provided an
       assessment of developments in Lebanon which promoted a brief discussion: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> observed that information coming in
         last night and this morning on the situation in Lebanon, was somewhat more favorable in
         tone, but the situation essentially seesawed back and forth, and must be regarded as very
         delicate indeed. The rebels controlled a large part of the countryside, and some of the
         towns and cities, as for example, the Moslem quarter of Beirut. There were continuing
         reports of the infiltration of Syrian irregulars across the long and uncontrolled
         Syrian-Lebanese border.</p>
        <p>“Eighteen U.S. light tanks had arrived in Lebanon yesterday by sea and would be promptly
         turned over to the Army. A government announcement to the effect that it had no intention
         of amending the constitution in order to permit President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> to have another term of office, had had a disappointingly slight
         impact upon the rebel forces, who were anxious to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> at once. Accordingly, the outlook over the longer term was very bleak.
         The Syrian ’volunteers’, <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0112"/>with <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s backing and plenty of weapons, can continue to send
         in as many people as they want. The virtual civil war in Lebanon provides these people with
         admirable cover.</p>
        <p>“Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s attitude was hard to
         analyze. He had started out vigorously to clean up the situation, but recently had appeared
         to be sitting on his hands. The time may therefore well be near at hand when President
          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and his Prime Minister will feel it
         necessary to call for U.S. and U.K. intervention with military forces. To make matters
         worse, in parts of the country the situation has degenerated into a struggle between the
         Christian and the Moslem elements of the population, a development which the Central
         Government had desperately tried to prevent. Accordingly, the United States must prepare to
         receive a possible request for the intervention of our armed forces, perhaps within a week
         if the situation continues to deteriorate.</p>
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> warned that if the United States
         and Britain were actually to intervene, such a course of action would inevitably be
         regarded an intervention on behalf of the Christian element in Lebanon’s population. The
         Lebanese had for many years tended too much to place reliance on the protection of outside
         powers—the Turks, the French, the British, and, lately, ourselves. It would be very much
         better if somehow the Lebanese could win through with our political and military backing,
         but without the actual intervention with U.S. troops. If they did succeed this time, they
         would not in future continue to look to Paris or London or Washington for their own
         protection.</p>
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>, the Acting Secretary of State,
         pointed out that Lebanon’s case against the United Arab Republic was presumably to be
         considered by the Arab League on Saturday. There had accordingly been a delay in
         considering Lebanon’s complaint against the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in the
         United Nations Security Council. Moreover, the U.S. Government has insisted to the
         Government of Lebanon that we could not contemplate intervention in the hostilities until
         the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had considered Lebanon’s complaint and until we
         received a request for intervention, which should come not only from President <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> but from the Government of Lebanon as a whole. We
         wanted a sympathetic Lebanese Army if our own forces were to enter the country.”

         by Gleason on May 29; Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, NSC Records)</p>

       <item>Throughout morning Ambassadors were generally surrounded by self-appointed emissaries
        advocating <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> Cabinet as a solution of present
        state of civil war in Lebanon. These included various messages through intermediaries from
        opposition leaders; increasingly shrill protestations from third force (e.g., Pharaon, et
        al) and Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli, a former staunch advocate of <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s reelection, who now feels <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> Cabinet is only means of ending conflict. Bishop told me this morning he
        had told both <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and Patriarch yesterday question
        of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s renewal was completely dead and in this
        received <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s concurrence.</item>
       <label>(2)</label>
       <item>French Ambassador yesterday evening saw Patriarch and said three Ambassadors had
        received assurances from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> on question of
        re-election. Patriarch concurred <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should last
        out his term and indicated willingness use his influence with opposition to get them to
        agree to a cease-fire and lifting of general strike if a <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> Cabinet could be formed.</item>
       <label>(3)</label>
       <item><persName>Roche</persName> then saw <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> last
        night at Junieh. General was noncommittal as to his own candidature. He revealed his
        continuing profound suspicion of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and need for
        bona fides latter would not try to succeed himself and came up with counterproposal it would
        be far better to set up a “neutral” government in which all sectors of Lebanese opinion
        might have confidence. However, names he mentioned were so neutral as to be neuter.
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> also had intricate formula for convocation by
        Patriarch of a Moslem-Christian groupment to triple-rivet guarantees against <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s re-election; a letter signed in blank by President
        for dissolution of government to be used “in case of necessity”; and an approach via US
        Embassy Cairo to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. French Ambassador indicated
        strong doubt that he and his colleagues could envisage such a complicated arrangement as
        meeting urgent necessities of moment.</item>
       <label>(4)</label>
       <item>Three Ambassadors met before lunch and agreed it was of essence to find out whether or
        not <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> would accept Prime Ministership. It was
        agreed I should see General as soon as possible. Immediately before departure for Junieh for
        my appointment at 3:30 this afternoon [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
         declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had learned from Turkish
        Ambassador he had found <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in complete <pb n="82"
         xml:id="pg_82" facs="0114"/>funk this morning and General had estimated he could not
        militarily continue longer than two days. At Cabinet meeting according to <persName
         corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> (later confirmed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
         source text not declassified</hi>] by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>)
        government discussed whether or not <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> should be
        asked to resign. I later checked both with General and President and was told by <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> he had made no such estimate to Turkish Ambassador.
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had confined his observation to
        saying that within next four to six days he would see more clearly how military situation in
        Tripoli could develop. My own estimate is that Turkish Ambassador misconstrued whatever
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> told him. What is certain is <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s assertion to me this afternoon that <persName
         corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> got into flap and advised Cabinet <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was running out on them and that they had better seek
        another Commander-in-Chief. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he is
        summoning both <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Turkish Ambassador this
        afternoon to form his own conclusions on this particular episode. (Prime Minister later told
         [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] General would be
        summoned before Cabinet.) This would be of minor importance were it not possible that it may
        trigger off decision by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to remove <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Commander-in-Chief. Whether Army would remain
        steadfast following departure of its General is a major question mark.</item>
       <label>(5)</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> confirmed report brought me by ARMA this
        morning that govt has asked General to prepare military plans for opening a major
        thoroughfare through Beirut Moslem quarter of Basta. Middle-ton tells me this is a
        suggestion originating with Mikkawi who impressed <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> with his urging that a
        group of tanks and fifty men could open Basta completely. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> said <persName>Sami Bey</persName> had taken one and a half hours of his
        time discussing this subject but he, Chaheb, would not attempt to open Basta because carnage
        involved would not be worth results obtained. This question is cited not for its intrinsic
        importance but because again it may be used by govt as pretext for removal of <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</item>
       <label>(6)</label>
       <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> this afternoon three Ambassadors
        had received evidence of a general desire that he take Prime Ministership provided this
        would bring end to civil strife. However, as had French Ambassador last night, I found
        General still of a divided mind. He said main fear was that if he took Prime Ministership he
        would be sabotaged by “that bloc” around President. By this he apparently meant principally
        Phalange Party since this was only name he mentioned. However, it was clear General is still
        rankled by sabotage work on him last week in the Fawzi–Qawugji affair. General said he still
        felt solution of a “neutral” govt would be best and that he had not made up his mind on
        acceptance of Prime Ministership.</item>
       <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0115"/>
       <label>(7)</label>
       <item>I returned directly from Junieh to see <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
        and told him of efforts Ambassadors had made at his suggestion in endeavoring to find a
        political solution. I said there were now so many intermediaries running to and fro that we
        had to deal with principals directly. However, all three Ambassadors felt time was rapidly
        running short for them to be of much further utility if on one hand General did not wish to
        take office and if on other President had not clearly resolved to offer it to him. <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said his readiness to appoint <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Prime Minister would be conditioned by his certainty
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> govt would bring a prompt end to hostilities.
        Otherwise he would stand steadfast with <persName>Sami Solh</persName>.</item>
       <label>(8)</label>
       <item>Foregoing was drafted before Ambassadors received text of Patriarch’s press conference
        this morning (Embtel 4357).<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">In telegram 4357 from Beirut, May 30,
         the Embassy reported on a statement that morning by Maronite Patriarch Boulos Boutros
         Meouchi. Meouchi told a group of foreign correspondents that President <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> “should take a vacation abroad” in order to bring an
         end to the present crisis. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> At our evening meeting I
        found French Ambassador livid with what he calls a super-double cross from Patriarch. All
        three Ambassadors are also not happy over milk-toast communiqué issued by <persName
         corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> after his departure in which he “roars like a dove” at
         <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. All three of us share view that following Patriarch’s
        demand for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s resignation and his refusal to
        accept <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> formula, plus continuing indecisiveness
        of General, plus <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s resolution not to accept
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> unless this can bring a definitive solution,
        there is little more we can do. We plan to take a short long week-end.</item>
       <label>(9)</label>
       <item>Test will come in my own opinion on issue of whether <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> dares to dismiss <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and, if
        so, if General who said once more to me this afternoon, “I have the rifles,” might then be
        tempted to take power. Fortunately, in Lebanon, everyone (except, of course, the three
        Ambassadors) is decisively indecisive.</item>

       then led to general discussion of Lebanese situation which brought out little of interest
       except for fact that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s formula for solution is
       “peace without victory or defeat” and assertion that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
       mass of information available re atrocities in eviction of Syrians (some actually being sent
       over border nude) but was not releasing for fear making bad situation worse and possibly
       raising question of action against Lebanese here. Conversation did however afford occasion to
       refer to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s reported disposition to renew
       discussion of situation with me and to Haikal’s undertaking to arrange, which seemed fit in
       well with Department’s instructions in reftel to seek approach <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"

      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was definitely in one of his difficult moods

        >Nasser</persName> said he still felt <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should
       stay on until another president elected but he did not feel justified in urging this point of
       view on opposition unless there was clear guarantee that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> would not victimize opposition in revenge during few months remaining of
       his term. What position would he (<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>) be in if he
       urged opposition be reconciliatory and then have government institute persecution campaign
       program against them, especially since situation developing into confessional conflict with
       Christians, led by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, out to get Moslems?</p>
      <p>He had not, said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, played part in starting
       present troubles, had not maintained contact with opposition and could not assume
       responsibility of intervening to bring conflict to end unless he could do so by agreement
       with USG and on understanding latter would underwrite any guarantee given to safeguard
       opposition. I said [I] had been talking personally and not in position suggest deal.
       Situation is that we have been doing everything we can to reduce dangerous potential in
       Lebanon, and on assumption <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> similarly disposed,
       I ventured renew hope he would do what he could. However, he remained obdurate, maintaining
       that risk of unilateral action was too great; would only intervene in association with
       US.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, added <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, he convinced that he is
       faced by conspiracy of governing heads of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon against <gloss

       what radio now doing under his orders. It is matter of defense and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

      <p>4404. There is at present a precarious lull in Lebanon. Military situation seems to have
       reached tacit cease fire with army preventing partisans on either side from engaging in
       communal strife. However <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss> reports indicated steady buildup
       of anti-government irregulars, although no central organized command has been identified.
       Although conditions in Tripoli are tense life in Beirut is returning to normal with exception
       that Moslem Basta district is still closed and very much in hands of partisan bands,
       estimated at 2, 100 against <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, probably balanced
       by a similar number defending the President.</p>
      <p>On <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> front a similar stalemate continues. Following
       declaration of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> (Embtel 4272)<note
        n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">See <ref target="#d51fn2">footnote 2, Document 51</ref>.</note> giving
       assurances his government will not amend constitution to pave way for <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s reelection, main domestic bone of contention has been
       removed. Clamor of extreme opposition leaders for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> immediate resignation now has less appeal; and Maronite Patriarch’s
       extraordinary press conference (Embtel 4357)<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">See <ref
         target="#d54fn2">footnote 2, Document 54</ref>.</note> has boomeranged against <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> remaining in office until end of constitutional term but
       with his government pledged to no renewal for a second term.</p>
      <p>With Lebanon case under consideration by Arab League and held pending in Security Council
       of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it seems useful to review causes of conflict which are
       numerous and not as simple as various partisans would have us believe. In particular, with
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> now in New York, <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
        >USUN</gloss> and Department will receive his very partial account of how</p>
      <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>
      <p>Lebanon difficulties began. In all objectivity it cannot be said this is a black and white
       issue of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> aggression against Lebanon. Although evidence of
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> infiltration and subversion is conclusive, in my
       judgment root cause of Lebanon’s present difficulties was of domestic origin. It was
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s determination to stand for a second six year
       term in office which provided pretext for this near rebellion, although <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his henchmen were quick to take advantage of issue
       thus presented.</p>
      <p>Department and <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> (as well as Embassies London Ankara
       Baghdad and Amman) may wish to keep in mind following points: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item><p>With or without question of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s desire
          to succeed himself a trend had set in in Lebanon toward a more neutral stance in foreign
          affairs prior to recent crises. However, present state of quasi civil war has not been
          fought on a foreign policy issue and it would be a great over-simplification to ascribe
          Lebanon’s present division only in terms of “pro or con <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
           >Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine.”</p>
         <p>Attitudes toward <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s foreign policy may have
          contributed to basic likes or dislikes for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
          as a leader but were not in my opinion controlling factors. This judgment describes
          domestic opinion; it does not bear on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
          enmity for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and his supporters which probably
          is based on foreign policy issues.</p></item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Although not of noble motivation one of main springs of present insurrection was
         simple desire of the “have-nots" to become “haves.” Basic personal hatred for <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> of such opposition leaders as <persName>Saeb
          Salaam</persName>, Abdullah Yafi and Junblat sprang not alone from ideological differences
         on foreign policy but more intimately from fact that in 1957 elections <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> brought about their defeat for Parliament. In fact
         alleged issue of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine was in some
         measure merely coincidental with timing of last Parliamentary elections where rankle of
         personal political defeat coincided with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
         espousal of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>There has been undoubted subversion and infiltration from <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss> particularly Syria, but this has been going on over past two years. There
         have been a number of political enemies of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         living in voluntary exile in Syria; and it is fairly clear Serraj and Company have been
         only too willing to supply Lebanon partisans with clandestine arms, funds and other
         support. Evidence of actual involvement of Syrian agents and particularly of military
         cadres is much more difficult to substantiate. Certainly Lebanon Army has not thus far
         secured any impressive number of prisoners whose presence on Lebanon soil in flagrante
         delicto would have provided major proof for <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> allegations
         against <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. At maximum it would seem <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was ready and willing to assist opposition against <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> once they had called general strike and had unleashed
         a not very well coordinated action of armed insurrection, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
          line of source text not <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0120"/>declassified</hi>]
         suggested <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> deliberately brought about Metni
         assassination which triggered off general strike and led to armed conflict. Most palpable
         evidence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention against <gloss
          target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> lies in incontrovertible proof of press and radio incitement
         to civil war both from Damascus and Cairo. It would be interesting if <gloss
          target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might some day be able to establish a norm of international
         conduct (if not international law) violation of which would indicate wrongful interference
         by one state against another through use of radio and press.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Another cause of Lebanon difficulty is ancient division of country between Moslems and
         Christians. By tradition and practice Christians have had edge over Moslems both in
         assignment of political plums (President always being a Maronite Catholic) but also because
         Christians have had a much higher standard of living and have tended to monopolize more
         lucrative offices and professions. Although in pious theory Christians are a slender
         majority (51 percent) we suspect that in fact more prolific Moslems are today more numerous
         than Christians. Fact Christians have not dared take a census since 1936 corroborated this
         conclusion. There is in any event a built-in Moslem inferiority complex and feeling of
         ranking inequity which has been exacerbated by recent dreams of Arab glory awakened by
          <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item>There is as yet no clear cut manifestation of desire by Lebanon Moslems to join <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Although in moments of exaltation probably all the Sunni
         Moslems could be worked up to demand such a union. They are but 25 percent of population.
         We very much doubt if Shiites would wish to submerge their confessional identity in larger
         Sunni community: and have similar reservations re Druzes. Christian population almost
         unanimously would strongly resist incorporation in <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
         Thus recent fighting in Lebanon has not been caused by question of incorporation of Lebanon
         into <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In consequence, because this is a highly fragmented problem which defies simple black and
       white diagnosis, I believe we should adopt an attitude of caution in our <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presention unless for other motives, we desire to use Lebanon
       issue as a means for carrying out a conscious policy of enmity toward <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with a view to
       splitting off Syria and trying a “neo-Suez” against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. As seen from here British, Turks, Iraqis, and Jordanians would like
       nothing better than to seize upon present difficulties in Lebanon as an excuse for fighting
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. To do so they will have to stretch the case
       to an extreme in order to fit the procrustean bed of their policy if the issue is to be
       fought on facts as they are in Lebanon. All that can be said is that for largely domestic
       political causes this little county has come to a crisis in which issues of foreign policy
       were subordinated to issues of personalities even though those personalities symbolized
       foreign policy; and that interference from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was
       contributory but not controlling to the main dispute.</p>
      <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0121"/>
      <p>What we may hope to see internally in Lebanon is continuation of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> government sufficiently
       strengthened to resist inevitable demand of opposition for recourse to new elections. In this
       I am encouraged by fact that General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has twice
       volunteered opinion to me it would be disastrous to hold such elections following deep
       division resulting from present insurrection. Elections would most certainly return a
       Parliament far less friendly to the west and would serve internally to divide Lebanon with
       possibility of ultimate Moslem dominance. This would certainly turn Lebanon pro, and
       eventually might force her in, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>On wider stage of foreign policy most recent development of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine by the Secretary and President as indicating US readiness to
       assist in preservation of independence and integrity of nations of Middle East as vital to
       our own national interest and world peace will have contributed much, I think, to general
       stabilization and security in this area. This determination manifested by US will enhance our
       prestige and influence and may long postpone, if not avert, a future attempt by <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> against the integrity of Lebanon.</p>

        <p>“There had been no great change in the situation in Lebanon, said Mr. <persName

         change was not good news, because the absence of change plays against the Lebanese
         Government, which was failing to put down the revolt. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>, the Chief of Staff, seemed to lack the guts to use his army against
         the dissident forces. There would be no doubt, either, of massive support for the rebels by
         the United Arab Republic. The current tactics of the rebels seem to be to cut off the
         northern half of Lebanon from the southern half. Thus the total picture, while it changed
         from time to time, was generally gloomy, and President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

      <p>1999. Foreign Under Secretary Gailani asked Fritzlan<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">A. David
        Fritzlan, Counselor of Embassy.</note> call on him evening June 3 to discuss important and
       urgent question which turned out to be Lebanese situation.</p>
      <p>Gailani, stating he was speaking on behalf Arab Union Government, said that reports
       received from Iraqi Embassy Beirut indicate position of Lebanese Government steadily
       deteriorating and that drastic treatment will be needed if situation is to be retrieved.
       There had been, he remarked, some expectation that General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> would be asked to head a government, and that would have helped, but now
       it seemed doubtful if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would do this.</p>
      <p>Coming to the point, Gailani said AUR Government believed time had come to apply <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine to Lebanon and that Lebanon’s friends
       should encourage <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to invoke Doctrine.</p>
      <p>Fritzlan commented that question of applicability of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine to Lebanon was under constant study by US and that doubtless
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself was giving it much thought, that
       implications of invocation of Doctrine were very far reaching and to a large extent
       unfavorable to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s position and that he seemed to
       realize this. There was, of course, basic question of whether threat to Lebanon came from
       countries under control of “international Communism”. Gailani appreciated these difficulties
       but continued to press for application of Doctrine as only way of saving Lebanon from
       domination if not absorption by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>In response to a question as to exact thinking of AUR Government concerning remedy to
       situation Gailani said US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should respond to an appeal
       from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> by making available forces which would
       quickly quell insurgency. Gailani indicated he was going to <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91"
        facs="0123"/>make similar representations to British Embassy. Gailani had no faith in Arab
       League’s ability to help Lebanon and very much doubted <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss>
       would be able take any effective action.</p>
      <p>Fritzlan asked if AUR Government had yet urged <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to invoke <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine.
       Gailani said he believed Jamali en route to New York had done so in talk with <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Beyond this there had been no “official démarche” on
       subject.</p>
      <p>I would appreciate receiving Department’s instructions as to what should be said to Gailani
       on question he now raised.<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">The Department responded in telegram
        3154 to Baghdad, June 4, with an assurance for the Arab Union government that the United
        States was determined to take whatever steps would prove necessary to insure the
        independence and integrity of Lebanon. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWJ2"
         >Gallman</persName> was instructed to call on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_alSN1"
         >Nuri al</persName>-Said to convey this assurance, but, at the same time, to note that the

        security forces were willing to take firm and effective action in defense of Lebanese
        independence. <persName corresp="#p_GWJ2">Gallman</persName> added: “At this juncture we

        could be usefully employed, receding rather than advancing.” (Department of State, Central

        position, which was that the Lebanese Government had initiated trouble by making accusations
        against the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
        was merely responding in kind. Haikal said that the only way to bring the crisis to an end
        was by agreement between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on a
        “third force” plan whereby <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would serve out his
        term while a neutral government, possibly under <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName>, would be established to assume responsibility and offer amnesty to the
        opposition. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.;</hi> included in the microfiche supplement)</note> We
       are not averse to consultation with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> about
       Lebanese situation if this will lead to his exerting constructive influence on Lebanese
       opposition. However we like you cannot<pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0124"/>take at face
       value line which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Haikal putting out re
       posture of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in this crisis. Furthermore it seems to us
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> trying induce us to join with him in
       advocating to <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> an arrangement which would be regarded by
        <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> and Arab friends of US as attempt to facilitate
       achievement of desires of Lebanese opposition and as whitewashing of intervention which
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has employed to assist this opposition. We do not wish
       to accept political repercussions both in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> and in other
       parts of world which would result from what we believe would be regarded as placing by US of
       seal of respectablility upon <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s intervention
       against legally constituted Lebanese authorities. It would also be impossible for us, even if
       we so desired, to guarantee future conduct of Lebanese Government with regard to domestic
       opposition.</p>
      <p>While we thus cannot envisage a situation where <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> and USG would join hands in urging upon <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
        >GOL</gloss> a detailed solution of what is essentially a Lebanese internal problem, we are
       anxious to see this problem solved before implications grow any wider. We believe it now
       clear that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> will make no effort to succeed
       himself. With this issue out of way and in light <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
       acknowledgment of capability clear up matter in 24 hours and of their expressions of concern
       over implications situation further dragging on, we fail to see good reason why <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> does not attempt exert moderating influence forthwith.
       We cannot take at face value his expressed concern for fate of opposition leaders. Realities
       of internal Lebanese politics and kid glove treatment of opposition leaders during height of
       insurrection belie such apprehension. In effort to facilitate exertion by <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of constructive influence in Lebanon, and in order
       continue consultation with him and to dispel idea we turning deaf ear to <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> proposals we are willing, if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> is agreeable, simply to convey his proposals to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for latter’s consideration. In causing this attitude to
       be known to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> you should state that we ready take
       this action in view our desire be helpful in present situation but that in our view problem
       is basically internal one which must be decided by Lebanese authorities themselves.
       Specifically we would be unable undertake to guarantee future conduct of <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> toward domestic opposition leaders just as we are unable to
       guarantee or control action of any sovereign government in world toward its own citizens. If
       however <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> proves receptive to idea of amnesty and
       offers one covering activities of opposition to date, and should later there be indications
       effort being made by <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> not to live up to terms of amnesty
       with respect of acts of opposition prior to date thereof, we would be prepared use our

      <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. The Situation in Lebanon</hi></p>
      <p>1. The situation in Lebanon, as in the rest of the Arab world, has been profoundly
       influenced by the rise of radical Arab nationalism and the expansionist objectives and
       subversive activities of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Underlying the present
       conflict in Lebanon is a condition of increasing tension between forces favoring open
       alignment with the West and those favoring the “positive neutralism” of the radical pan-Arab
       movement led by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and reflected in the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. There is a rough correspondence between these contradictory
       tendencies and the Lebanese Christian and Moslem communities; the sharpening of the issue
       tends to break down the modus vivendi whereby those communities have hitherto combined to
       form the Lebanese state.</p>
      <p>2. The present conflict was touched off by indications that Christian President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> intended to amend the constitution in order to succeed
       himself. This has antagonized some pro-Western elements as well as the neutralist elements,
       and provided <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with an opportunity which he has
       exploited. The situation is complicated by personal and political rivalries within the
       Christian and Moslem communities as well as between them. The opposition, which includes
       Christians as well as Moslems, has no common objective other than forcing <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> from office and as yet has no common leader. Many of its
       most militant elements have been stimulated by the rise of radical pan-Arab nationalism to
       challenge the status quo in Lebanon. They have also received from <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> policy guidance, propaganda support, and weapons, supplies, and “volunteers,”
       which have greatly increased the difficulties facing the Lebanese government security forces
       in their efforts to cope with the uprising.</p>
      <p>[Here follow paragraphs 3–6 containing general information on the situation in
       Lebanon.]</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Consequences of a Collapse of a Pro-Western
        Government Without US Intervention</hi></p>
      <p>7. Most politically conscious elements in the Middle East identify <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> with the US. They probably believe that the US is
       committed to the preservation of a Western-oriented regime in Lebanon if not to the
       continuation of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself in office. In these
       circumstances, if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s government or a pro-Western
       successor government collapsed under the onslaught of anti-Western opposition elements,
       friends and enemies of the West alike would believe—irrespective of whether any formal
       request for help had in fact been made—that the US had proved itself unwilling to come to the
       aid of its declared ally and friend, and that it had capitulated to <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The governments of Middle East countries disposed
       toward cooperation with the West would be strongly influenced to revise their policies.</p>
      <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0127"/>
      <p>8. The reaction to a US failure to intervene would be strongest and most harmful to the US
       if there had been a publicized request for US assistance prior to the collapse of a
       pro-Western government in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>9. We believe that the disorders in Lebanon have already cost the US some prestige in the
       area, since they are widely interpreted as evidence of deep-seated and powerful opposition to
       a chosen instrument and client of the US. Any political compromise in Lebanon will cause some
       further loss of prestige, and the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       by clearly anti-Western forces would be construed as a drastic weakening of US resolve to
       maintain its interests in the area.</p>
      <p>10. Moreover, collapse of a pro-Western government, with no US action, would almost
       certainly accelerate the activities of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and its
       supporters in seeking to undermine anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       regimes. Popular sentiment would be more inclined to view the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> as the wave of the future, and there would be some increase in the danger of
       collapse of anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regimes.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Probable Consequences of US Intervention</hi></p>
      <p>11. Lebanese generally are probably fearful of the consequences of intervention by Western
       troops. Reactions would be conditioned, however, by the circumstances in which intervention
       took place. In a situation in which the Lebanese believe that domestic conflict was primarily
       the result of internal differences, most would tend to oppose intervention; many would accept
       intervention if they believed that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> sought to dominate
       and absorb Lebanon; but most Moslems would probably prefer domination by the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to Western occupation.</p>
      <p>12. If the US were to intervene at the request of President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> under present circumstances, the reaction of the Christian community
       would be divided and a majority of Moslems would be strongly opposed. If <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> were to gain a larger measure of control of the internal
       political situation and if the integrity of Lebanon appeared to be threatened by Lebanese
       extremists and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, most of the Christians would probably
       rally behind him and accept intervention, but only a small part of the Moslems would do so.
       If <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> were to yield to a successor government
       committed to maintaining Lebanon’s integrity and tacitly friendly to the West and if the
       integrity of Lebanon under that government were in turn jeopardized by Lebanese extremists
       aided by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, such a government could probably get most
       Christians and some Moslems to support it if it asked for US intervention.</p>
      <p>13. In the complex Lebanese situation, one immediate problem confronting the intervening
       forces would be that US forces would probably find themselves in hostile contact not only
       with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-controlled subversive elements, but with a wide
       variety of local elements <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0128"/>not presently hostile to the
       West but acting either in opposition to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or to
       foreign intervention in principle. Even if General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> were willing to cooperate fully, some of the Moslem elements in the army
       might desert. In any event, clashes with opposition forces and expanded opposition activities
       probably would force the US to commit large forces to deal with large areas of Lebanon. For
       instance, it probably would prove necessary to conduct operations in areas other than the
       principal coastal cities in order to cope with guerrilla or terrorist activities and to block
       logistical support being sent to opposition forces from Syria. This would increase the risk
       of clashes with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces and of inadvertent violations of
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory.</p>
      <p>14. US military intervention would keep any pro-Western government in office. If it took
       place in behalf of a pro-Western government which had succeeded <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>, most of the Christian population would unite behind it. In any event,
       US intervention would be widely regarded as a move to perpetuate Christian dominance. The
       government’s capability to govern the Moslem portion of the population would be drastically
       reduced. The local Moslem-Christian conflict would not only be intensified but would also be
       more closely identified with the broader issues between pan-Arab nationalism and the
       West.</p>
      <p>15. Thus, it would be extremely difficult to create a stable situation not clearly
       dependent on US forces. In the longer run, any regime so dependent would probably be held in
       widespread contempt, not only by anti-Western but also by most moderate elements. It probably
       would not long survive the withdrawal of Western forces. Thus, the US might find itself faced
       with the onerous choices of a prolonged stay in Lebanon or a withdrawal while the situation
       was still unstabilized.</p>
      <p>16. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Reaction:</hi><persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> leaders have
       assiduously exploited the Lebanese crisis to promote the cause of radical pan-Arab unity.
       They would treat US military intervention as a direct challenge to their long-range
       objectives, but would also regard it as presenting substantial opportunities for exploitation
       in the area. Their reaction would be sharp: <list>
        <label>a.</label>
        <item>They would be certain to step up their propaganda campaign against the US, the Baghdad
         Pact, and the anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> governments, notably those of Jordan
         and Iraq. They would take vigorous action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, almost
         certainly with Soviet support.</item>
        <label>b.</label>
        <item>They would probably continue and possibly increase covert assistance to opposition
         forces in Lebanon, including support for terrorist actions against US troops and civilians.
         However, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would try to avoid direct clashes
         between regular <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces and those of the US.</item>
        <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0129"/>
        <label>c.</label>
        <item>They would probably take sabotage action, directly or by proxy, against Western oil
         interests in Lebanon and possibly by closing down or sabotaging the Syrian pipelines. They
         might also attempt sabotage against oil operations in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrein,
         and Aden.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Elsewhere in the Area:</hi> The governments of Jordan and Iraq would
       probably welcome US intervention as a blow against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> and as an encouraging demonstration of US determination to support its
       friends in the area. However, there would be strong adverse popular reaction in these
       countries against the US move. This popular reaction would limit the freedom of action of the
       governments. In these circumstances, effective Iraqi and Jordanian cooperation in the
       intervention cannot be assumed. Other Arab governments, such as those of Libya and the Sudan,
       which are vulnerable to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s moves, would also
       welcome US intervention, but would be even more restrained than Iraq and Jordan from openly
       supporting it. The governments of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan would almost certainly support
       the US move. The Saudi Arabian Government would probably seek to avoid involvement in the
       situation.</p>
      <p>18. To the extent that the intervention succeeded in restoring a stable pro-Western
       government in Lebanon, Arab popular reaction would become colored by respect for US firmness.
       There might be some decline in belief in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as the wave
       of the future and the pace and scope of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> expansion might
       be reduced for a time. This would not, however, seriously weaken the long-term trends in the
       area toward radical pan-Arab unity. If the US were forced to maintain its forces in Lebanon
       for a protracted period, the popular reaction would become increasingly adverse, since the
       occupation would be played up and probably accepted as evidence that the US intended to
       re-establish Western imperialist control in the area.</p>
      <p>19. Israel would view intervention by the US as a favorable precedent. However, realizing
       that its open cooperation would be unwelcome to the West and would probably serve mainly to
       unite the Arabs, Israel would probably avoid direct involvement in the situation as long as
       the conflict remained confined within Lebanon.</p>
      <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Reaction:</hi> The nature of the Soviet reaction to US
       intervention with military force would vary according to circumstances and the Soviet
       assessment of opportunities to damage the US position. If the US were to intervene in Lebanon
       in order to assist the government to cope with a <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
       >UAR</gloss>-supported uprising, the Soviet reaction would probably be confined to vigorous
       diplomatic and propaganda action. If, in the course of this intervention, the US became
       involved in military action on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory, the Soviets
       would react more strongly, possibly increasing military assistance and providing
       “volunteers.” Although the latter course of action would increase the chance of a <pb n="98"
        xml:id="pg_98" facs="0130"/>Soviet-US conflict through miscalculation, we believe it
       unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would take action which it estimated
       would involve serious risk of general war.</p>
      <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Effect of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Participation:</hi> We
       believe that adverse reaction to intervention would be intensified if the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> participated, but the considerations set down above would not be
       significantly altered.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Outlook</hi></p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (21½ lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>24. Whatever the outcome of the present crisis, we do not believe that the present
       political-religious balance, with its slight edge in favor of the Christians, can long be
       maintained in Lebanon as presently constituted. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will
       almost certainly continue to exert formidable pressures upon Lebanon, encouraging the Moslem
       element to reach for greater power, to contest the Christians’ Western orientation, and to
       move in the direction of neutralism and pan-Arabism. Thus, the long range tendency appears
       likely to be in the direction of increased instability, with the possibility of fragmentation
       or some accommodation with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>

      <p>4472.1 had a general talk with President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> last
       night and found him sorely perplexed at military and political situation. It was obvious
       President had increasing doubts as to fidelity of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>. We know <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has been given
       forced feeding of suspicion and rumor by his advisors including one story of an elaborate
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> family plot against <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> which would result in an almost compete sell-out to <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. In this atmosphere, and given General’s own refusal
       vigorously to prosecute military campaigns against insurgents, it is not surprising that
       President is of uncertain mind on what to do about the General. For example, <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> complained to me <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> had actually requested permission to take a week’s leave at his home in
       Junieh on ground he was “fatigued”. President likewise was <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99"
        facs="0131"/>much vexed at reports from Air Force General had ordered pilots not to fire on
       given objectives, apparently for fear they would hit partisan bands or rebel villages.</p>
      <p>When I asked <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> if he intended to get a new
       Commander-in-Chief, President said I must keep in mind this was a very small country and
       firing of General was not as easy as it might be in a larger country. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> therefore seems saddled with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> whether he wants him or not.</p>
      <p>President said General had been charged with writing up one more of his seemingly endless
       series of “plans de campagne” and that he the President would make up his mind “within 48
       hours” on what final decision to take re General. We have been through a month of “48 hours”
       and I do not expect that any determinative action will be taken at end of this next two-day
       period. More ominous was <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s statement that if in
       next few days situation did not improve, “I might have to ask the three Ambassadors to
       consider new means of finding help.”</p>
      <p>Immediate military interest centers on what our ARMA considers to be an effective battle
       plan prepared by <gloss target="#t_G31">G–3</gloss> for reduction of the Basta. This
       operation should commence this morning and is militarily feasible in opinion of Colonel
        <persName>Stinnes</persName>. It can therefore be taken as a test, first of <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s readiness to move in effectively against the main
       focus of insurgent infection; and second, of degree to which either by his own desire or by
       possible sabotage in the General Staff, a feasible operations plan may possibly miscarry.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> last night read me translation of an
       intercept from a voice radio outside Lebanon which he said was in obvious Egytian Arabic. It
       called upon rebel forces under <persName>Sabri Hamadi</persName> in the Bekaa to effect
       junction with Jumblatt’s Druzes with apparent intent to cut line of communications between
       Beirut and the Bekaa with ultimate objective of moving against Beirut. At the same time
       rebels in the Akkar were ordered to move apparently as a diversionary measure. Three times
       during this voice message, date of June 7 was indicated as zero hour. This again may furnish
       some evidence of outside direction of rebel forces; or it may be, if authentic, a rebel
       counter-measure against operation being mounted in the Basta. At all events next few days
       should militarily provide a crisis and enable us to draw certain conclusions both as to rebel
       capabilities and—of possibly greater importance—degree of loyalty of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and his staff.</p>
      <p>On political front I asked <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> where he thought
       opposition leaders now stood. He said that while individually many of them were prepared to
       be reasonable and to consider a peaceful end of insurrection, when they gathered together
       they became more bellicose, each vying to exceed the other in shouting defiance.</p>
      <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0132"/>
      <p>I said that if this were the case, it seemed to me obvious antidote was to separate
       opposition leaders and keep them from meeting. I likewise indicated <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s continued interest in amnesty for leaders of
       opposition. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he was prepared to see that
       all had easy routes of escape if that would satisfy <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"

      <head>62. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>On June 6, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Charles Malik</persName> asked the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security Council to consider the complaint against the
       United Arab Republic which Lebanon had addressed to the Council on May 22. (See <ref
        target="#d48">Document 48</ref>) <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> charged that
       arms had been supplied on a large scale by the United Arab Republic to “subversive elements”
       in Lebanon and added that those elements has been “trained in subversion” in the United Arab
       Republic and then sent back to Lebanon. He also charged that officials of the United Arab
       Republic had participated in the “direction” of the rebellion, and were waging a “violent”
       press and radio campaign against Lebanon. (U.N. Doc. S/PV.823, pages 1–22)</p>
      <p>The Representative of the United Arab Republic, Omar Loutfi, denied <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s charges and termed them unsubstantiated. He maintained
       that the underlying cause of the present “troubles” in Lebanon was the desire of President
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to be reelected “at any price.” (<hi
        rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> pages 22–32)</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_BJW2">James W. Barco</persName>, Deputy U.S. Representative in the
       Security Council, referred to the charges brought by <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> as “disturbing” and added that the evidence adduced by <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> to support his charges was impressive. He took note of
       Loutfi’s statement that his government had no intention to intervene in Lebanon’s domestic
       affairs or to threaten Lebanon’s integrity, but concluded that the situation merited the
       Security Council’s consideration. For text of this statement, see <hi rend="italic">American

        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would see me at 5:30 and I have just returned from what,
       on surface at least, was much more satisfactory discussion than when we last met (Embtel
        3151).<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4"><ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>After I had repeated substance Deptel as previously transmitted through Haikal, <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said wanted repeat two things in hope he would be
       believed. First was that he does not seek incorporate Lebanon in <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> because believes would be mistake. Second is that he doesn’t want have
       government in Lebanon subservient <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. When there had been
        <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> governments in past headed by persons friendly to Egypt
       he had made no demands on them. All he wants is government that will not be hostile. When
       Osseiran came here prior <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s Moscow trip and
       asked what he wanted, he had replied in this sense.</p>
      <p>As regards present situation in Lebanon, it is bad and getting worse. Both sides are
       continuing to arm and blood calls for blood. It is imperative do something, not because he
       fears charges being made against <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He is confident these
       can be handled adequately. That angle is secondary. What is important is tragic deterioration
       in Lebanon itself.</p>
      <p>This is why he had discussed possibility of joint approach in our two previous talks
       because it was only approach which he felt would work and he still felt that way.</p>
      <p>Regarding our offer to pass on his ideas to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>,
       he was frankly dubious since he knew <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> disliked
       him and would probably spurn any of his ideas out of hand. Furthermore, putting forth such
       ideas unilaterally could lay him open to charge of interfering in domestic politics. Would be
       much better work jointly. Why not?</p>
      <p>I replied not in position explain why idea of joint approach had not appealed to USG other
       than to say that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s proposals to that effect had
       been fully reported and that our present proposal made against that background. Inferentially
       this dictated joint approach had not found favor in Washington and, by renewing proposal to
       that effect, we would seem to be going back to just about where we started.</p>
      <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0134"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> thought for a while and then said he had
       another suggestion. Why didn’t USG make same proposal itself? Then, if <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> responsive, he would do all he could to get opposition to
       accept it exactly same way he would have done if approach had been joint. Furthermore, he was
       willing not press for elections, as mentioned in our first talk on Lebanon (Embtel
        3029).<note n="5" xml:id="d63fn5"><ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note> He could see
       would be difficult in present highly emotional situation. He did feel, however, that
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> only answer to question of replacement
        <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> and he also thought he would be logical man for
       presidency since he seems to be one person who is generally trusted. <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said knew <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       pro-West and not pro-Egyptian and also that would not be in conformity normal pattern have
       Christian as Prime Minister. But these things were not important. What is essential is to
       look to future Lebanese security and that means now having Prime Minister whom opposition
       trust and later President on whom there should be general agreement in advance. If this were
       done and choice were <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, prospects would be much
       more promising.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> seemed accept without question our reluctance
       to guarantee amnesty but willingness use influence to maintain amnesty if <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> accepted.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> also said wished make plain that he does not
       have close contacts with opposition as seems be generally assumed. In fact he is not exactly
       sure what happening or what opposition want. As consequence, ideas which he suggested had not
       been discussed with opposition and could not be sure they would accept. However, he would do
       best through means at his disposal, including <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Embassy
       Beirut.</p>
      <p>My impression of conversation was that, despite negative character of our suggestions,
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was at least gratified hear that his proposals
       had been considered and, as consequence, seemed to be in mood to make serious effort toward
       solution of Lebanese crisis. What his basic thinking may be still remains difficult fathom
       but, for tactical or other reason, he gave definite impression this afternoon of wanting see
       Lebanese situation cleared up under a Christian president and I feel we would be well advised
       to seek means to hold him to his word, which means, of course, that reciprocating gesture by
       US would now be in order so as keep ball in play.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, at end of conversation I asked <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       frank question why, if he had no designs on Lebanon, he had for sometime past long antedating
       present crisis, given <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> such rough time. He said answer was
       simple. It was because <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> had worked actively against Egypt
       in other countries of area, mentioning specifically Jordan and Saudi Arabia, <pb n="103"
        xml:id="pg_103" facs="0135"/>and because <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> had allowed
       Lebanon to become haven for plotters against Syria and Egypt formerly and now <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. If this type of hostility would cease, there would be no
       problem.</p>
      <p>Naturally, this was not whole story but I did not think it would be profitable to vitiate
       generally constructive tone of conversation by becoming involved in prolonged debate on this
       many-faceted question.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, wish renew suggestion that reasonably prompt reaction on our part to
       foregoing could be helpful.<note n="6" xml:id="d63fn6"><p><persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
          >Hare</persName> supplemented this telegram on June 8 with telegram 3244 from Cairo, in
         which he concluded:</p>
        <p>“Sum and substance of foregoing would seem to be that, for reasons not entirely clear and
         probably rather complex, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would like to
         liquidate his (disclaimed) commitment in Lebanon and bring crisis to end. To extent that he
         has become involved in Lebanon, I do not feel my heart wrung by compassion to bail him out
         when things may not have gone as foreseen. However, real question is security of Lebanon,
         not giving <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> object lesson, however desirable
         that might be, and, viewed in that light, I would suggest that we give serious
         consideration to his proposals in reftel and indicate our reaction as soon as possible.”
         (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/6–858)</p>
        <p>In telegram 4548 from Beirut, June 9, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>
         supported <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>’s suggestion that <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s proposals should be given serious consideration. He
         felt that it would not be impossible to negotiate an agreement with the <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> government on the amnesty issue and on the proposal
         that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> should be installed as Prime Minister.

      <p>The Secretary pointed out that we have aid for Lebanon reasonably well in hand. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> confirmed this statement with regard to the
       present situation, but pointed out that just prior to the present hostilities Lebanon had
       announced the intention of asking for $170 million in aid over a period of six years. He said
       that we have recently offered Lebanon an attractive package composed of development loan fund
       help, technical assistance and aid under Public Law 480, designed to meet political as well
       as economic needs. He pointed out, however, that we can not progress much further with this
       until the present situation in Lebanon is clarified. As regards the immediate problem of help
       to the government in its crisis, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> believed
       that we were progressing well on the covert side where greater flexibility is required in the
       use of money.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that he does not believe <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       will hold on for a second term and hence will not be in power beyond September. In all
       probability we need now to find a vigorous successor to support who will be friendly to the
       West. The Prime Minister said that in his view the situation was very dangerous. There was
       already great strain upon the government and it might not be easy to find a successor to
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> who would work with us in the same way. The
       President commented that so many leaders in that area say they are friendly to the West but
       when confronted with anti-Western forces refuse to fight. However, he noted that General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> appeared somewhat more active in the last
       couple of days. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> added that General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is using napalm bombs and is taking other
       forceful military measures which indicate that the government and army consider they are now
       playing for keeps. The Prime Minister expressed his belief that it would be very hard to keep
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in power for a second term and the President
       agreed with him saying that if we should try, we would be asking for even more rebellion,
       since it was <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> who provided the spark in the
       present situation.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> estimated that <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> might be willing to succeed <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> and that he might be the best choice even though he has recently shown a
       lack of political astuteness. He pointed out that there really are very few suitable
       candidates from our point of view and of those who exist <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and the Edde brothers seem to have the strongest personalities. He noted
       that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself had told our Ambassadors the
       question of a second term was no longer an issue.</p>
      <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0138"/>
      <p>The Prime Minister said that we will just have to keep watching the situation closely and
       maintain our plans in a state of readiness. The Secretary stated that while to send forces
       into Lebanon is the lesser of two evils even this course is still an evil. He believed that
       it would be difficult to get them out once they are in, since the government that invites
       them may very well fall with great violence once they depart.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">On

      <p>On June 10, Swedish Representative Gunnar V. Jarring submitted a draft resolution to the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security Council calling for the dispatch to Lebanon of
       an observation group “to ensure that there is no illegal infiltration of personnel or supply

        >USUN</gloss> Press Release No. 2939, June 10, 1958) After extensive debate, the Security

      <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> subsequently discussed the
       resolution with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Charles Malik</persName>.
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> explained that his country would have preferred
       a stronger resolution condemning the United Arab Republic for interference in Lebanese
       affairs, but recognized that any resolution stronger than that proposed by Sweden would have
       been vetoed by the Soviet Union. (Memorandum of conversation, June 13; Department of State,
       Central Files, 783A.00/6–1358; included in the microfiche supplement) Ambassador <persName

       feeling of relief in the Lebanese Government over the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
       resolution. President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was particularly elated.
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> noted that the British and French
       Ambassadors concurred with him in the assessment that, with adequate forces, the <gloss

       partisans and arms from Syria. (Telegram 4653 from Beirut, June 12; Department of State,

       has been subject consideration highest levels US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
       Governments. We are not willing to become accomplice with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> in any moves not desired by <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>, but if
        <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> wished we would follow up this opening. Following
       instructions are in this context. You should inform your <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
       colleague in strictest confidence of proposed approach to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> officials have undertaken to treat
       matter on Eyes Only basis. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
      <p>You should inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> orally that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has indicated he might be willing to use his influence
       to try to end dissidence within Lebanon provided it was understood a) <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would finish his term b) <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> to become Prime Minister c) amnesty for opposition, who <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> believes would otherwise be unwilling to come to
       terms.</p>
      <p>We are conveying this information as matter loyalty to Lebanon and not because we endorse
       proposal which is for Lebanon to decide. Neither can we assume any responsibility for
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s good faith.</p>
      <p>In deciding what to do <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should know that US
       and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments adhere scrupulously to prior commitments.
       As <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> knows we have foreseen grave difficulties
       surrounding the introduction of foreign forces in Lebanon, and continue to hope that Lebanese
       independence can be effectively preserved without this measure of last resort.</p>
      <p>You should emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that discussions with
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> have been such that advantage cannot be taken
       of his possible willingness to seek solution by making this known publicly. We are convinced
        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0141"/>that any such public disclosure would in fact be
       extremely counterproductive for reasons that a) it would result in repudiation by <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, b) <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would
       increase attacks on <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>, c) it would be betrayal of <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s confidence as far as we are concerned, and d) it would
       create impression US not firmly supporting <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> which would
       redound to grave disadvantage to both GOL and US. We therefore wish to discuss this matter
       with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> on completely confidential and personal
       basis.</p>

      <p>4629. I saw <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> at 6 p.m. today and made
       representation authorized Deptel 4710.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2"><ref target="#d67">Document
         67</ref>.</note> After reading verbatim text very carefully President said it would be a
       most dangerous principle for Lebanon to admit that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> should set out terms for settlement of its internal difficulties. He
       said, “My successor may not have as strong nerves as I—and who knows what future demands
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may make of him?”</p>
      <p>President then described his complete distrust of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> saying that on numerous occasions Egyptian had made fair weather
       statements of respect for Lebanon’s integrity and independence but each time his deeds had
       belied his words.</p>
      <p>I pointed out Department’s approach was in terms of third paragraph reference telegram and
       we had not indicated to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> we had even intended
       discuss his three points with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. In consequence I
       would at once inform my government that in <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       estimate <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s suggested approach was not
       acceptable.</p>
      <p>Re fourth paragraph reftel <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in great
       earnestness said he wanted me to know Lebanon would not seek recourse to friendly
       intervention unless in “a case of extremity.” So far as he could judge military situation
       Lebanon had not yet reached this point. However, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> was disturbed at loss of Chouf to Jumblat’s partisans and said he had
       appointment with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> later this evening to discuss
       military plans for averting interdiction by rebels of transit to Bekaa via Beirut–Damascus
       highway. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> added that he knew his Druzes and now
       Jumblat’s forces had won a victory many tribesmen would pick up their guns and join Jumblat.
       He said, “They could attack Beirut in a force of between 4 and 5000 men in a few days”.</p>
      <p>President then reverted to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s three points. It
       was clear he had no taste for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Prime Minister
       because opposition, as we have reported, is endeavoring to bring in <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as stalking horse and intermediary figure in preparation
       for some other chief of state or government who will be more pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. However, on amnesty President again repeated his previous assurances to me
       that he would be willing to leave door open for opposition leaders to escape. He said he had
       for past few days had under consideration a public announcement by himself providing for
       amnesty for any rebel who was not involved in direct personal crime on condition such persons
       laid down their <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0143"/>arms. However, President said he
       could not very easily make such a declaration on eve of such setbacks as Jumblat’s victory in
       the Chouf. On contrary such a statement could only successfully be made after Lebanese armed
       forces had themselves gained a fairly significant victory over insurgents.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d69fn3">In telegram 3291 from Cairo, June 12, <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
         >Hare</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s reaction to the
        three-point proposal was exactly as foreseen by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName>. He questioned whether <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
        rejection was based on the substance of the proposal or on the fact that it was authored by
         <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He concluded that, whatever the basis for
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s attitude, “we do have right to give
        constructive advice in order prevent development of situation where we will find ourselves

        of the Near East should make it clear, not only by word but by acts, that they do not
        countenance civil disturbance as a means to achieve political results. Otherwise we feel

      <p>4689. My British colleague has kindly shown me extensive background telegraphic
       correspondence between London and Washington which has provided helpful perspective not only
       for instructions set out Deptel 4710<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2"><ref target="#d67">Document
         67</ref>.</note> but also so to thinking of <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn
        Lloyd</persName> on what we should do next. I am impressed by Foreign Secretary’s hope that
       “the Americans” can be brought to agree that we ought now very firmly to know where we stand
       vis-à-vis <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, his personal ambitions and his
       attitude toward the presidential succession which has been a basic cause of the civil war in
       Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Although perhaps too early to take all the auspices following passage of <gloss
        target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution, it is fairly clear opposition ranks have been
       severely shaken. Conversely <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s own confidence
       will have increased by gaining of what he called in telegram to <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> a “victory” at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> for his part will interpret <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s new position as having almost unqualified support from world
       community. This will harden <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s resolve
       preferably to succeed himself or failing that to handpick his successor. My telegram
        4638<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">In telegram 4638 from Beirut, June 12, <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported on a conversation with <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
        had indicated that he considered it essential that his successor be someone who would carry
        on his pro-Western foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> added that
        only if such a person could not be found would he consider succeeding himself. (Department
        of State, Central Files, 783A.11/6–1258)</note> is pertinent in this regard.</p>
      <p>It is in my judgment impossible for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to
       succeed himself. It is not however impossible for him to try, and this I fear may happen
       following passage of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution and prospect that struggle
       in Lebanon, with opposition increasingly deprived of support from <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> but with government free to call on western powers for aid can be intensified
       to point of victory by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</p>
      <p>Even if President conceivably could beat opposition in battle (a dubious proposition with
       Army under General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>) he can hope at most to
       become President of half the country. At same time he should not be required to contemplate a
       presidential successor so identified with opposition that it would seem fruits of rebellion
       were reward of presidency. A compromise candidate is indicated.</p>
      <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0146"/>
      <p>The three western Ambassadors are being importuned by moderate elements to help negotiate a
       solution between intransigeance of <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> on one side as
       illustrated by his defiant communiqué set out by Embtel 4664<note n="4" xml:id="d71fn4">On
        June 12, the opposition “National Lebanese Front” issued a statement, signed by
         <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>, which condemned the resolution adopted by the <gloss
         target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security Council establishing an observation team for Lebanon
        as irrelevant and likely to aggravate the situation. (Telegram 4664 from Beirut, June 12;
         <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/6–1258)</note> and intransigeance of <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> who, as indicated Embtel 4638, told me he would insist
       on a successor who would carry out <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       policies.</p>
      <p>Although I have noted from Department’s 4622 its view that now is not the time to express
       an opinion on who may next be president of Lebanon,<note n="5" xml:id="d71fn5">Dated June 4.
         (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/6–358; included in the microfiche supplement)</note>
       I submit that if Lebanon cannot be aided immediately to reach a compromise on presidential
       succession this civil war will continue and its threat of international involvement will
       increase.</p>
      <p>Accordingly I thoroughly endorse British suggestion that we have a frank talk with
       President and ascertain straight out where he stands on issue of presidential succession. I
       think we should be authorized to express honest doubts that after a month of civil war in a
       country so delicately balanced as Lebanon he can expect to return to office for another 6
       years or that he can hope to rule through a stooge.</p>
      <p>My British colleague agrees. Because of privileged nature <gloss target="#t_UK1"
       >UK</gloss>–US consultation in Washington we have refrained from consulting our French
       colleague but have every reason to believe he would go along with this recommendation.</p>

      <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> telephoned me at 12 noon
       today, June 14, and said that he had just been on the telephone with President <persName

       this morning, Beirut time, the rebels had broken loose in Beirut and there were then various
       engagements throughout the city going on after seven hours of fighting. One of the largest
       engagements was in the immediate vicinity of his house. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> said that he could hear the firing on the phone.)<note n="2"
        xml:id="d72fn2">Intelligence sources reported that the rebel attack was launched from a
        building approximately 220 yards from the Presidential Palace. The army responded with
        artillery and machine gun fire and demolished the building. The Prime Minister’s home was
        also reported under attack. The firing in Beirut ceased at 4:15 p.m. local time. (TDCS

        >Malik</persName> to inform the United States Government that he was calling an urgent
       Cabinet meeting this evening. The United States should know that in view of the worsening
       situation, if things are not in hand later this evening or tomorrow morning, the Lebanese
       Cabinet would in all probability take a decision to ask for the immediate intervention of
       United States, British and French forces.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that he had asked the President how he
       should respond if the United States officials should say that this was an internal problem,
       since the fighting was between the Lebanese. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       replied that we should be told that in Beirut alone there were about 500 Palestinians,
       together with a number of Egyptians and Syrians. He said that in the Shuf area there was a
       great number of Syrian conscripts who had completed their military service as part of regular
       Syrian forces.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that he would be in touch with the
       President over the next several hours and would keep us informed.</p>

       However, Sec. would estimate that there is a pretty fair chance that <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> may call on us to come in there, perhaps not because his
       own forces cannot hold the situation, but because they are not willing <pb n="117"

        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and the Cabinet. Sec. said yes. Sec. would
       like to have one of his people check up on what orders would be under the circumstances.
        <persName>Q.</persName> said they have certain part of forces that are nearby and available
       and are alerted to be ready to move in—there are other forces a bit more remote. Sec. asked
        <persName>Q</persName>. what they do when they get there. Q. said they move ashore,
       establish themselves (probably Beirut and Tripoli), and meet forces if attacked. Sec. would
       like to [have] someone from State check on what these orders really would be. Q. said fine.
       Sec. said political situation in Lebanon is not simple and we do not know what cooperation we
       can get. Sec. said he did not think Defense had political guidance they need and it is
       extremely confusing. Sec. said our original concept was that we would go in to help Army do
       its job and possibly hold positions in Beirut and Tripoli releasing their Army to take up
       problems elsewhere. The cooperation from the Army is not clear. President will have to make
       final decision. Sec. said it is one thing to go in as helpers of Lebanese Armies and another
       thing if they are hostile. Q. said we are wondering whether this indicates if we should have
       Task Force set up of joint staffs here and someone from State. Q. said they could have report
       tomorrow or Monday morning. Sec. said if <persName>Q.</persName> could set something up
       tonight or tomorrow morning it would be fine. Q. said he thought he better get hold of
       General Picher and have him at Pentagon or a satisfactory alternate. Sec. said he thought
       meeting should be held at Pentagon—State can only contribute political judgment. Q. asked for
       name. Sec. said either or both Bill <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> and

      <p>4779. Eyes only <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> from Secretary. I am
       concerned that situation developing in a way which may pose for us a very awkward problem.
       You will recall that our 4271 and 4482 May 13 and May 23 respectively<note n="2"
        xml:id="d75fn2"><ref target="#d31">Documents 31</ref> and <ref target="#d49"
        >49</ref>.</note> indicated that we would be prepared to intervene militarily “under most
       compelling necessity to meet a situation where integrity of Lebanon is genuinely threatened
       and where its own forces do not suffice for protection.” 4482 further requested you make
       clear to President our assumption that “Lebanese security forces would be exerting maximum
       effort to defend independence of Lebanon. He should be under no misapprehension that US
       forces can be counted upon to intervene in circumstances where Lebanese forces are unwilling
       to fight.”</p>
      <p>It is our impression that the Lebanese forces are in fact adequate to deal with the
       situation particularly now that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has intervened, but that
       they are not making a maximum effort to defend the independence of Lebanon because of
       internal factionalism. We also foresee danger that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> and Government may call for our military assistance when in fact
       situation could be dealt with if the Lebanese forces under General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> were wholehearted in their effort to do so.</p>
      <p>We believe that if there is any question of our being called upon we are entitled to get
       reassurances as to the attitude of the Lebanese forces as it would be one thing that we
       should move in militarily to cooperate and another thing to have to fight Lebanese forces or
       meet their opposition or lack of cooperation. Presumption of our 4271 and 4482 was that the
       Lebanese forces were doing their best and that we would be relieving them so that they could
       more effectively conduct the active fighting.</p>
      <p>We do not want to be in a position of seeming to give General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> a veto over our action but we would think it indispensable in some way to
       get dependable reassurances as to the probable reaction of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and the forces under him.</p>
      <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0151"/>

       today. This originated in an attempt by opposition forces from Basta seeking to take Sablons
       prison, apparently seeking to liberate prisoners who otherwise might have furnished
       incriminating evidence to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers. Although one police
       post was taken, army action frustrated attack. Opposition then turned main effort on
       President’s palace where [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in yellow sports shirt engaged in rifle fire from roof
       of palace. Fighting still continues intermittently in this area; air strikes were made with
       rockets against the Basta (but with unknown results).</p>

       to call for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>–US intervention; but he was by no means sure.
       At 19 hours [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
       received message Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> indicating that

       <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should immediately furnish “police forces” or (b) US might
       wish to despatch units of Sixth Fleet “strictly for protection of American lives and
       property” Prime Minister added he thought situation in Beirut was out of control and asked my

      <p><hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Situation in Beirut is undoubtedly grave and ability of

      <p>disposition should be able to forestall a descent by Jumblat Druzes against Beirut; and he
       could probably redeploy sufficient forces to maintain control in capital. In consequence I do
       not believe Sixth Fleet should be more than placed on immediate alert. However I do urgently
       recommend that our two destroyers which I understand are within six hours steaming, stand-by
       at dawn tomorrow, June 15, 30 miles off Beirut. They should be capable of 30 knots on call. I
       am by separate channel requesting opening of Voice Radio communications with these ships.</p>

      <p rend="center">THE LEBANESE CRISIS</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>The position of President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has
        substantially deteriorated during the past two weeks and Lebanon is in a state of civil war.
        Continuation of the crisis has not resulted in consolidation even of the Christian half of
        the country behind him. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is not calling
        on the Army to give the President all the support of which it is capable, partly because he
        fears a split between the Christian and Moslem elements in the Army, partly because he
        probably has ambitions of his own for the Presidency. There are reports of an impending Army
        coup designed to remove <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> from office and
        substitute <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. This move might not materialize
        without the sanction of the Western powers. We believe that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> cannot survive much longer without all-out Army support, and possibly
        not even with it. In this situation he may call for Western intervention at almost any
        moment.</item>
       <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0153"/>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could probably get Cabinet
        approval for a request to the Western powers to intervene, in view of the recent elimination
        of several Cabinet members who were opposed to it. It is doubtful that he could get
        parliamentary approval for such a measure, and it is extremely unlikely that he would try to
        do so. The request would almost certainly not have wide political or popular support,
        whether or not it were supported by General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.
        While General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has not committed himself on the
        matter, the indications are that he would not favor such a request.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>If the US were to intervene pursuant to a request supported only by <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and his Cabinet, the intervention would almost
        certainly be regarded with hostility by a majority of Lebanese, including nearly all of the
        Moslems and perhaps as many as half of the Christians. The adverse reaction of the Lebanese
        (and of the Arabs) to intervention would be intensified if the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
         >UK</gloss> participated, and very much more so if the French took part.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>We do not believe that the consequences of intervention would be appreciably different
        if the measure were justified as one to protect US lives and property, unless it were
        limited to a rapid operation to effect the evacuation of US personnel. Evacuation of all US
        personnel from Lebanon would, however, have serious consequences, especially for various oil
        installations and pipeline operations, [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines of source text not
         declassified</hi>].</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>In the complex Lebanese situation, one immediate problem confronting the intervening
        forces would be that they would probably find themselves in hostile contact not only with
         <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-controlled subversive elements, but with a wide variety
        of local elements not presently hostile to the West but acting either in opposition to
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or to foreign intervention in principle. Even
        if General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> were willing to cooperate fully,
        which, as we have suggested, is doubtful, some of the Moslem elements in the army might
        desert. The commitment of large Western forces might be required, and it would be extremely
        difficult to create a stable situation not clearly dependent on them. The US might find
        itself faced with the onerous choice between a prolonged stay in Lebanon or a withdrawal
        while the situation was still unstabilized.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>It should also be observed that the sending of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
        observers to Lebanon makes it more difficult, pending their report, to justify an
        intervention on the ground of countering <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
        penetrations.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>On the other hand, if President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> were in
        present circumstances publicly to request US intervention and be refused, conservative and
         anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> elements in the Arab world, and the
        governments of Jordan and Iraq in particular, would probably conclude that they could not
        rely on US support in the future. It would be widely regarded as a victory for <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and a defeat for the West, and <pb n="122"
         xml:id="pg_122" facs="0154"/>would be exploited as such by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
         >USSR</gloss>. A compromise between <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and the
        opposition, possibly involving a transfer of the Presidency to General <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, would not produce such strong reactions as would
        either US intervention or US refusal to intervene.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>The governments of Iraq and Jordan would approve US intervention in Lebanon, but would
        face a considerable increase of popular opposition at home and would be unable to render any
        substantial assistance in Lebanon. The governments of Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran would
        probably favor US intervention. Turkey, if the Cyprus situation permitted, might offer
        assistance. Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> propaganda has already been
        stepped up in anticipation of US intervention and will make the most of opportunities to fix
        the label of imperialism on the US. Israel would probably avoid direct involvement in the
        situation as long as the conflict remained confined within Lebanon.</item>

      <p>The Lebanese Ambassador telephoned me at 7:30 a.m. Sunday morning, June 15, to say that the
       Foreign Minister had been in telephonic communication with President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> earlier that morning and wished to see me on a matter of
       great urgency. He had asked if I could come immediately to the Foreign Minister’s hotel room
       for breakfast.</p>
      <p>Upon my arrival, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that
       President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had asked him to put a very serious
       question to the Department. While awaiting my arrival, he had written this out in long hand,
       as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“At 4:30 a.m. today, Sunday, June 15, 1958, I got in touch by telephone with President
          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in Beirut. He asked me to put the following
         question to the United States Government:</p>
        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0155"/>
        <p>“Realizing that the radio and press campaigns of the United Arab Republic are becoming
         more and more vicious inciting the insurgents in Lebanon to overthrow the Government by
         resolution and violence;</p>
        <p>“that the illegal smuggling of arms into Lebanon from Syria is increasing, as is
         evidenced by the fact that only yesterday, to cite one instance only, 23 cars were seen
         coming into Deir-El-Ashayir (at the frontiers between Lebanon and Syria) from Syria under
         the protection of Syrian army jeeps, where they unloaded huge quantities of arms which were
         distributed among the insurgents in Lebanon;</p>
        <p>“that the illegal infiltration of men from Syria to take part in the rebellion continues
         unabated if it has not recently increased;</p>
        <p>“that this morning, Beirut time, the President received official reports that
         parachutists were seen dropped from Syria on Lebanese territory;</p>
        <p>“that it is estimated that 500 Palestinians are taking part in the insurrection in Beirut
         alone, so that the Government is dealing with an internal foreign fifth column; and</p>
        <p>“that the decision of the Security Council was in our favor and the speeches made in the
         Council showed that there was a general belief that interference by the United Arab
         Republic was taking place in the affairs of Lebanon;</p>
        <p>“the President appreciates knowing if in the light of these facts the United States
         Government, which has repeatedly expressed its support of the independence of Lebanon and
         its readiness to help Lebanon preserve its independence, by military means if necessary and
         if asked to do so by Lebanon, will intervene at once militarily to help Lebanon maintain
         its independence, if the President and the Government of Lebanon should ask it to do so, in
         order to report the answer of the United States Government to this question to the Cabinet
         immediately this afternoon.</p>
        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MC9">Charles Malik</persName>.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>I told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> that I could not, of course, give
       him a reply to the message which would be susceptible to communication by open telephone. I
       thought that our reply to the question should be transmitted by telegram through Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> who was in any event fully informed
       regarding our attitude in this matter. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> asked
       if a “brief” response might be given at the time he informed President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> by phone that the full reply would be given through
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>. I reminded Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> that we had set forth a number of considerations with
       respect to any decision to put forces into Lebanon and I did not see how these considerations
       could be recapitulated in a few innocuous words. I told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"

         >Document 76</ref>.</note> received direct intimation from <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> US military intervention might be called for; and an even more urgent
       demand from Prime Minister. Under these circumstances we had to talk plainly as to capability
       of Lebanese Army to deal with situation and to have General’s military opinion on degree to
       which friendly forces, if landed, could enable Lebanese Army to go on with its job of putting
       down insurrection.</p>
      <p>General said his army was still doggedly doing its duty but he frankly did not see a
       successful outcome. He thought situation would continue to deteriorate to point of
       hand-to-hand fighting but offered no conjecture as to how by his own military means he could
       quell what was in fact a civil war.</p>
      <p>At same time General looked with obvious distaste on prospect of allied intervention. He
       repeated his previous prediction that army might commence to disintegrate if foreign forces
       were landed. He said in any case in that event he would resign as commander in chief. When I
       inquired as to assurances of cooperation on part of Lebanese military if our forces were
       debarked, General said of course his staff would cooperate—"If there still is a General
       Staff”. He said in making this estimate he was “speaking anonymously”.</p>
      <p>On brass tacks of degree to which foreign intervention would relieve Lebanon Army for more
       effective operations, General said we could of course occupy Beirut for protection of
       American lives and property but this would have very slight effect upon his dispositions as
       army only has in Beirut a rag tail of artillerists, muleteers and drivers. He does not have
       even a company of infantry in capital at present</p>
      <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0158"/>
      <p>although he expects in next day or so to bring back one company presently engaged in Chouf
       against Jumblat. Where main effect of relief for Lebanese forces would be felt would be at
       Tripoli where <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has three infantry battalions.
       General said if Americans or British were landed north and south of Tripoli more or less
       sealing off that town he could probably pull out two battalions for use against insurgents in
       the Bekaa and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>To sum up these are my conclusions: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Commander in chief sees no prospect of quelling insurrection by his own means although
         he is willing to continue to fight in a defensive manner. In fact he said explicitly
         Lebanese armed forces were on defensive, initiative having passed to rebels.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Our own military experts do not concur with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>’s conclusion expressed preceding paragraph as they feel Lebanese armed
         forces if led with initiative and conviction could most certainly put down civil war
         although at a fairly high cost in casualties. This estimate is of course conditioned on no
         further increase outside intervention. Nevertheless fact remains that so long as <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is commander in chief Lebanese Army will probably not
         bring a military conclusion to hostilities.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> does not welcome prospect of allied
         military intervention but appears to believe it inevitable since he is convinced <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> will
         presently ask for our intervention.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Lebanese armed forces will not oppose allied landings and will probably cooperate in a
         lukewarm way. Extent and vigor of Lebanese armed forces’ resistance would then depend upon
         new command of Lebanese Army and degree to which rank and file would remain loyal. Our
         estimate is less gloomy on this point than that of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item>All this adds up in my opinion to need to get a new general before inexorable logic of
         events calls for allied landings in Lebanon. This I intend to urge upon <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</item>

       yesterday there were some indications they would invite the French. Sec said we should

      <p>4790. On basis telephonic instructions from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       10:30 a.m. this morning Beirut time, <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> has given
       Dept informal paper reciting claims <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> assistance to
       insurgents, including report that parachutists seen dropped from Syria on Lebanese territory,
       and asking whether US will intervene at once militarily to help Lebanon maintain its
       independence, if President and <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> ask it to do so.<note
        n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">See <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note> He states reply will
       be reported to Cabinet this afternoon.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> US position this regard unchanged and stated hope <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is in touch with you on question since you fully and
       currently informed. He stated he did not see how we could give to <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> answer susceptible transmission by open telephone, particularly since as
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> knew our willingness to intervene would be based
       upon certain assumptions which had been discussed with President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> agreed and suggested that
       he inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that reply will be given through
       you.</p>
      <p>You may inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that our position regarding
       military assistance in Lebanon has not changed. Certain facts, however, should be
       recalled.</p>
      <p>One, the primary purpose would be to protect American life and property while at the same
       time assisting the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> in its military program for the
       preservation of the independence and integrity of Lebanon. We believe that any request from
       Lebanon should be couched in terms of the inability of Lebanon to perform both the function
       of preserving its own independence and of protecting foreign life and property; including
       several thousand Americans, and therefore the US is requested to perform the latter function.
       You will recall that our 4271<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3"><ref target="#d31">Document
        31</ref>.</note> stated that any “request should be couched in the terms indicated”. We went
       on to say that once the troops are there they would in fact serve to help to protect the
       independence of Lebanon.</p>
      <p>A second factor is as pointed out in our 4482,<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4"><ref
         target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> namely, that we must be able to count upon the
       Lebanese security forces themselves exerting maximum effort to defend the independence of
       Lebanon and that there would be friendly cooperation between its forces and any US forces
       there.</p>
      <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0161"/>
      <p>A third element is the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> has just sought
       and obtained a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution to station
       observers in Lebanon. This is in the process of being carried out and the US would find it
       very awkward to act while it was still uncertain that this <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       action would be inadequate and where the responsibility for collapse of <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort would be generally attributed to US.</p>
      <p>Before we can make a definitive response we shall need <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s assurances and observations on these points and also we shall seek a
       Baghdad and Amman answer as to their reactions, as indicated para. 3 our 4271. In the
       meantime our forces are held in a state of instant readiness.</p>
      <p>There is no disposition on our part to retreat in any way from the position set forth in
       4271. It is necessary to verify some of the assumptions of that cable and to pay some respect
       to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort which Lebanon itself invoked and with the
       results of which it professed to be satisfied.</p>
      <p>With respect to this last matter, we suggest that minimum would be the convocation of
       Security Council again in emergency session with a <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> report
       that an obvious effort is being made to thwart <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action by
       stepped-up campaign to destroy Lebanon independence before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       can properly organize its observation teams and that in consequence situation has so
       deteriorated that Lebanon is unable to discharge its dual responsibility to protect its own
       independence and to protect foreign life and property. It is therefore inviting certain
       countries whose nationals have important life and property in Lebanon requiring protection to
       assume this responsibility so that the forces of Lebanon can concentrate with the help of the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observation team on preserving Lebanon’s independence.
       There might also be need for emergency <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action.</p>
      <p>We assume you recall our 4390.<note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">See <ref target="#d81fn3"

      <p>The Secretary had only a few minutes for a meeting with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName>. Knowing this, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had
       prepared an outline of what he would like to say, in order to save time.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that the fury of Nasserism and
       Communism was utterly unleashed upon Lebanon. The Government of Lebanon did not mind that,
       but considered it an honor that it had been singled out as the unique object of that fury,
       because Lebanon knew what was at stake. It felt that its battle was a battle for the Middle
       East, and in a sense a battle on behalf of the entire free world. The fury of Nasserism and
       Communism expressed itself through radio and press propaganda of a character heretofore
       unheard of as being directed against a country with which those attacking theoretically
       maintained friendly relations; through smear, vilification, incitement to murder and
       rebellion, and the use of unbelievable names which must be repugnant to the entire free
       world; by putting into Lebanon limitless money for bribery and corruption; through
       large-scale smuggling of arms and equipment; through infiltration of agents and fighters from
       outside Lebanese territory, especially from Syria.</p>
      <p>Lebanon was now the main target of this “infernal” work. It was not so strong as to be
       beyond the possibility of being disintegrated under the combined fury of Nasserism and
       Communism. It was small, relatively isolated, weak militarily, divided in itself, and
       unprotected by treaties except for the Charter of the United Nations. The forces opposing
       Lebanon could easily destroy it. It was a wonder, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> said, that Lebanon already had resisted for thirty-five days. The choice
       now was either to yield, compromising in such a manner as would gain for the enemies of
       freedom a victory, or to continue to resist and fight until exhausted. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> felt that the latter was the only course to follow, since
       if they yielded their conscience would plague them all <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131"
        facs="0163"/>the rest of their days. However, if they were not to lose the battle, they
       needed psychological, material and military help beyond their own means.</p>
      <p>If it should become necessary for Lebanon to ask for the introduction of foreign forces to
       assist it, this would be a decision with implications in the Arab world of great and lasting
       importance. There would be placed upon Lebanon “shame and reproach” which he felt must be
       shared by others, particularly by other Arab states. He thought, therefore, that three things
       were necessary in connection with any such request: first, it should be clear that the help
       was asked in extremis, as a last resort when nothing else would meet the situation; second,
       the request must have some concerted Arab and Arab state support, open support which the
       whole world could see; and third, the request must have legal and moral sanction of the
       United Nations.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> emphasized the importance of Iraq and
       Jordan joining in assistance to Lebanon. He thought we should exert immediate pressures to
       have them move to come to Lebanon’s aid before Western military forces were introduced. There
       should be careful synchronization of efforts between Lebanon, the United States, the United
       Kingdom and Turkey to persuade Iraq and Jordan to come in. This, he thought, would share the
       “shame and reproach” of seeking outside assistance. If the action of Lebanon in resisting
       Communism and Nasserism was serving the cause of freedom, then the action of Iraq and Jordan
       would be serving the same cause as would the action of the other countries in asking them to
       assist.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> concluded by saying that the aim was not
       only to achieve the independence of Lebanon; there were different kinds of independence. The
       aim was to emerge from the ordeal so as not to give Communism and Nasserism the comfort of
       having achieved a victory in the area. Not only must Lebanon safeguard its independence, but
       we must all work together so that the forces of freedom will not appear to have retreated
       under the onslaught of Communism and Nasserism.</p>
      <p>The Secretary responded that he was greatly impressed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName>’s statesmanlike presentation. He said he would not conceal his concern
       lest a military response by the West would have the effect not of checking Nasserism but of
       strengthening it, of giving it a new charter. He was thus impressed with the danger, set
       forth by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, of Lebanon being reproached for
       having invited the Western nations to assist militarily, in consequence of which Lebanon’s
       friends in the Middle East also would be weakened by such a request. He was happy that Dr.
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had such broad vision to see the problem in
       proper perspective. He believed that we should attempt to get the support of Iraq and Jordan,
       and also a larger measure of support of the United Nations. He understood that Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> had told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName>
       <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0164"/>earlier that the Secretary was concerned lest,
       having created the United Nations observer group and Cordier having arrived with several
       hundred personnel on the way, action might be taken which would place upon Lebanon and its
       Western friends the onus of responsibility for any failure of this <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> action. If we were to act in any way seeming to cut across the United Nations,
       the results would be bad. He thought another round in the Security Council would be essential
       before introducing any foreign forces. There should be some basis, by consensus procedure or
       otherwise, of getting approval of such a Lebanese request. He asked that Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> give further thought to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> aspects of this matter. He said that we were already in touch with Iraq and
       Jordan and should soon be receiving an indication of their attitude.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d83fn2">Telegrams 2755 to Amman and 3254 to Baghdad, both June 15, instructed those
        Embassies to provide assessments of whether Jordan and Iraq could be counted upon to support
        Lebanon in further recourse to the United Nations or in a request for Western military
        assistance. (Both <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note></p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> thanked the Secretary. He said that in the
       event external forces appeared to be the solution, it would be preferable for Jordan and Iraq
       alone to provide such forces, with the Western powers giving full support short of actual
       introduction of their own forces. In any event, he hoped that Iraq and Jordanian forces could
       be moved in, to be supplemented in stages by other forces.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador agreed with this, saying that if the Iraqi and Jordanians moved in even
       token forces, the United States could help greatly by moving the Sixth Fleet off the coast of
       Lebanon as a direct warning. The Turks might also contribute to pacification of the situation
       in Lebanon by massing forces on the Syrian border. By these actions it would probably be
       unnecessary for the non-Arab forces actually to land in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>The Secretary excused himself since he had to leave at once for a meeting with the
       President on this subject.</p>

      <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> first outlined the
       situation, which the Secretary noted had been clarified somewhat as a result of his talk with
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> about fifteen minutes previously.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d83"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> recalled that <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> called him about noon Saturday, June 14, saying he had heard from
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that the situation was critical with fighting
       around the palace, and was close to being out of hand. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> did not request United States intervention, but put us on notice that such
       a request might be imminent. Later Saturday, our own information from Beirut indicated that
       the immediate situation was somewhat improved, but the long-term prospects remained
       gloomy.</p>
      <p>Sunday morning at 7:30 o’clock, Washington time, <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> again called <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> and asked for
       an urgent meeting. At this meeting he said that he had heard from <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> that the situation had again worsened, with parachutists from Syria
       being reported in Lebanon, some 500 Egyptian-trained Palestinians fighting in Beirut, etc.
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> wished to have an immediate answer, to give to
       the Cabinet Sunday afternoon, to the question whether the U.S. would intervene militarily at
       once if asked.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> had replied that he could not give any
       answer which would be suitable to transmit to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       by telephone, but that we would give our answer through our Ambassador.</p>
      <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0166"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> asked later Sunday if he could call <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> with our approval and merely say “hold firm—do not yield”. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> had replied that he could not, since this was subject
       to various interpretations. For example, we would agree that he should not yield on any
       matter fundamental to the independence of Lebanon, but we would not agree that any reasonable
       compromise should be excluded.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then read cable No. 4790<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3"><ref target="#d82"
         >Document 82</ref>.</note> from the Department to <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
        >McClintock</persName> giving our answer to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       request. He also read cable No. 4710<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">In telegram 4710 from Beirut,
        June 14, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported that he had found
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> deeply pessimistic that morning. The General
        described the military situation as neither good nor bad, and added that he foresaw an
        indefinite struggle in which neither side could gain ascendancy. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> stated that it was essential for a neutral government to be formed, and
        said that, in his opinion, the only chance of ending the downward spiral in Lebanon was for
        the three Western ambassadors to impose a decision as to who the next president of Lebanon
        should be. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/ 6–1458; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> from <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reporting his
       latest talk with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then handed an intelligence
        estimate<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>
        36.4–1–58, <ref target="#d77">Document 77</ref>.</note> to the President, and also referred
       to a telegram [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] that
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had prepared a memorandum containing a 24-hour
       ultimatum to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to take effective command of the
       Lebanese forces or relinquish his command. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       presumably intended to discuss this with his Cabinet Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Secretary remarked that there was much plotting going on in Lebanon, and probably there
       were well-advanced plans for a military coup to place <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> in the Presidency. This effort by <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to replace <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as army
       commander might bring such plans to a head.</p>
      <p>The Secretary also noted that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> is moving rapidly and
       vigorously to implement the Security Council resolution. Cordier is already in Beirut, and
       the Secretary read from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>’s 1490<note n="6"
        xml:id="d84fn6">In telegram 1490, June 13, <persName>Andrew W. Cordier</persName>, Executive
        Assistant to the Secretary-General, reported from Beirut that only a small portion of
        Lebanon’s frontier was under government control and accessible to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
         >U.N.</gloss> observers. (Department of State, Central Files, 330/6–1358)</note> containing
       Cordier’s report. The Secretary noted that the Secretary General plans rapidly to recruit
       several hundred observers from Italy, the Netherlands, Ceylon, and Burma.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then reported on <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s call at 4:30
       Sunday afternoon at which time (speaking from an outline) <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> had said that any Middle East country inviting armed intervention by
       Western Powers would be the subject of “shame and reproach" for generations. Therefore, three
       prerequisities to such a request were essential: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>That the request be made only “in extremis”,</item>
        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0167"/>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>That there be some Arab participation in, or support of, the intervention, even if
         token. In this regard, he was thinking particularly of Iraq and Jordan.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The action must have the moral support of some organ of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
          >U.N.</gloss>, either the Security Council or the General Assembly.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Secretary had told <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> this was a statesmanlike
       approach, and coincided with our own thinking. If we were to intervene without such
       conditions being met, the intervention would not succeed and actually would not help the
       government that had called on us for help.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then pointed out to the President that this latest statement represented a
       considerable reversal of <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s thinking, and probably
       was strictly his own thinking, not shared by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or
       the rest of the Lebanese Government. Nonetheless, the Secretary felt that the thinking was
       sound, and corresponded substantially to our own original conditions for intervention,
       possibly somewhat up-dated. The Secretary pointed out that any intervention at this moment
       would be looked upon as undermining and causing to fail what some might feel is a vigorous
       and promising <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> initiative, which in itself had been taken
       at Lebanon’s request and with which Lebanon had professed satisfaction. The Secretary felt it
       would be catastrophic to lay ourselves open to such a charge. Therefore, he felt that we
       probably ought not to make an immediate military response before exploring further with Iraq
       and Jordan what they were willing to do, and before taking certain further actions in the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> In this connection he mentioned a cable which Lord Hood
       of the British Embassy had just read to him from <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn
        Lloyd</persName> saying that we ought not to act until there had been at least one more
       round at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
       <note n="7" xml:id="d84fn7">The cable was summarized in a memorandum of conversation between
        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and Ambassador <persName
         corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>, June 15. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
        783A.00/6–1558; included in the microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> then reported that the French Charge
       had told the Department a few hours earlier this afternoon that a French warship was moving
       to the area solely for the purpose of protecting French lives in the area. The French had
       stressed that this action was not being taken under the Tripartite (1950) Declaration, since
       French help had not been requested, but was solely to protect French interests. The Admiral
       in command had been ordered to get in touch with U.S. and U.K. commanders in the area upon
       arrival in the area. The Secretary commented that the French will undoubtedly intervene if we
       and the British do.</p>
      <p>There was some general discussion about the internal effect in Lebanon of intervention, and
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s gloomy predictions of the response of the
       Lebanese army; and our own intelligence estimates of <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0168"
       />the army’s reaction, which were not quite so gloomy. Nonetheless, it was apparent that a
       substantial part of the population would undoubtedly oppose our intervention, actively or
       passively.</p>
      <p>The President then asked a rhetorical question: How can you save a country from its own
       leaders? <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, for example, has not yet fired
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, despite more than ample cause.</p>
      <p>The President said he also took account of the possibility of a concurrent French
       intervention; and the fact that we would be in a bad spot if we intervened without the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> having first reported that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> action was ineffective. To be legal, any intervention must be in response to a
       request by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> context. The President was also reminded of the situation in the early 1950’s
       when the British were trying to hold a base in Suez with the entire population against them,
       and the impossible situation that resulted. He also recalled that our Middle East doctrine
       had been directed only against external aggression. The President wondered, therefore, what
       possible future there would be if we intervened except to remain indefinitely. He felt, in
       this regard, that the arguments which we had advanced to the British and French against their
       intervention in Suez might be pertinent also in this instance—particularly the question:
       Where would it lead; where would it end?</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented that Turkey, Iran and Iraq would undoubtedly favor our
       intervening.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented that <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> probably wants <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to fail, since he probably wants his job.</p>
      <p>The President commented that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was symptomatic
       of the whole situation. There seemed nobody on whom we could pin our hopes. The President
       said he had little, if any, enthusiasm for our intervening at this time.</p>
      <p>The President commented that what was really needed in Lebanon was a strong leader whom we
       could back strongly. Otherwise we would be intervening to save a nation; and yet the nation
       is the people, and the people don’t want our intervention.</p>
      <p>The Secretary noted that if there were a “Korea-type” intervention involving many countries
       under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> aegis, it would be a quite different situation,
       and probably all right. There seemed, however, little likelihood of this.</p>
      <p>At this point, the Secretary noted the unstable and weak situation in Iraq, and <persName
        corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName>’s recent intemperate statements to the U.S. and U.K.
       Ambassadors about the poor condition of the Arab Union.</p>
      <p>The Secretary noted that this general weakness of pro-Western governments in the area must
       be considered in any action we take— we must have the proper conditions before we can take
       any action.</p>
      <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0169"/>
      <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has a good case about
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention, and <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> made it quite well in the Security Council. However, <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has not made it well publicly. He has not appealed to
       his own people, or to his parliament, or made a loud and effective public case.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented that the Soviets have not
       entered the Lebanese situation at all except by radio.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then pointed out that if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> calls
       on us and we do not respond, that will be the end of every pro-Western government in the
       area. This leaves us with little or no choice, even though every alternative is “wrong”. The
       President agreed, and noted that in such circumstances we would have to fulfill our
       commitments.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said we should have no illusions that
       if we move in militarily we must move firmly and promptly to help establish a regime which
       could survive our withdrawal. This would mean in all probability a pro-Western dictatorship,
       since there is not sufficient popular support in Lebanon for Western intervention.</p>
      <p>The President commented that if we are forced to intervene, we should do everything
       possible to intervene under the most favorable auspices and circumstances, and also attempt
       to bolster the Lebanese army as soon as possible, so that our forces could withdraw quickly.
       The President directed General Twining to have the Chiefs of Staff study the military
       possibilities and problems involved.</p>
      <p>The President also felt that we should examine the possibility of putting in massive
       military support, possibly accompanied by numbers of technicians, as the Soviets did in
       Syria, as an alternative to military intervention.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> pointed out that the critical time for
       the Lebanese Government would be after it had requested outside assistance and had so
       reported to the Security Council, and before the military assistance arrived. Internal
       discontent with this move would then place the government in great jeopardy. Therefore, we
       must be prepared to move most promptly when the request became public.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that it would be unthinkable to move until some <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> action had taken place, even though this might mean a certain delay and
       danger. It was agreed that the possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> actions should be
       urgently studied.</p>

      <p>4756. Re last sentence <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 4746<note n="2"
        xml:id="d85fn2"><ref target="#d80">Document 80</ref>.</note> I saw <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this afternoon. Although our conversation was punctuated
       by near-by sniper fire, President was calm and resolute. Before I had opportunity to describe
       my views on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, President told me he had
       reached conclusion it was clearly impossible for Lebanese armed forces to re-establish
       security under <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s command. He said “I know our
       army can do it, but not with a General like that”.</p>
      <p>I then reported impressions derived from my interview with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> this morning and asked if it might not be possible to get a new General
       under whose leadership Lebanese armed forces could put down revolt.</p>
      <p>President said this might be possible but he feared army would be demoralized for first 24
       hours after dismissal of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. In that 24 hours mob
       might gain ascendancy in Beirut and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>On balance, although he was determined to remove General, it seemed safer for this to be
       done after an allied landing as <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> could be
       counted upon at least not to oppose and perhaps to assist <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
       and US contingents to establish themselves in Lebanon while if he were removed before
       landing, our forces might find themselves coming ashore to confront a state of anarchy.</p>
      <p>I asked President if we might not take a limited chance by having friendly forces within
       very few hours hailing of Beirut. Then, when <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       and his top officers were dismissed, there would be some assurance of ready support if things
       would commence to go wrong; while it was just possible army would be able maintain order for
       that vital 24 hours and then go ahead under new leadership against the insurrectionists. I
       told President I still hoped against hope Lebanon could settle its problem without western
       military intervention.</p>
      <p>For first time <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> asked me straight out how many
       forces we contemplated using. I gave him figure authorized <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
        >Deptel</gloss> 4401.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">Telegram 4401 to Beirut, May 19, authorized
         <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> to convey to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName>, if he asked, information concerning the size of the U.S.–U.K. force
        which could be made available in the event of a decision to provide military assistance to
        the Lebanese Government. The force contemplated was 5, 000 troops, broken down as 3, 000
        U.S. troops and 2, 000 U.K. troops. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/5–1958;
        included in the microfiche supplement)</note> He <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0171"
       />thought 5, 000 might be too few. I said in view of modern fire power and air strength in
       Sixth Fleet, I had every reason to be confident our forces would be sufficient to do the
       job.</p>
      <p>Turning to political aspects of intervention, I said we had to think of reaction elsewhere
       in world to allied forces landing in Lebanon. Our enemies would instantly portray such action
       as armed intervention by “imperialists" to maintain regime of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Camille Chamoun</persName> “against will of people”.</p>
      <p>Given this situation I asked President if it might not put a better face on things if he
       should convene Parliament in extraordinary session. Government could point to undoubted
       outside intervention in Lebanese internal affairs from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>;
       cite <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decision to send observers to prevent infiltration of
       illegal arms and partisans; and call upon opposition in name of National Union and need to
       preserve independence of Lebanon at once to stop fighting. Question of domestic political
       differences could be dealt with very simply by stating President and government commended
       call by Speaker of Parliament for session July 24th to elect a new president other than
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. If, as was probable, opposition failed to
       respond or its deputies boycotted Parliamentary session, government could then declare that
       since active infiltration of arms and men from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was
       continuing and tempo of fighting was increasing throughout Lebanon, it had no recourse but to
       ask friendly powers for assistance in maintaining independence of the state. A vote of
       confidence could then be taken (I assumed <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> still
       had a working majority) and it would be against this background that government’s appeal for
        US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assistance would be presented to the world.</p>
      <p>President said he would “wrinkle his brow" tonight on these suggestions which he thought
       had merit.</p>

        xml:id="d86fn2">In telegram 4767 from Beirut, June 16, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName> reported that he had an appointment with <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> that morning to convey the substance of telegram 4790 to Beirut. He
        also noted that he had discussed the Department’s concern about the impact of French
        intervention in Lebanon with the French Ambassador, who had responded that under <persName
         corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, it was practically certain that France would insist
        on at least token participation in any joint Western intervention. (<hi rend="italic"
         >Ibid.</hi>)</note> I left a letter<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">A copy of this letter is in
        Washington National Records Center, RG 84, Beirut Embassy Files: <gloss target="#t_FRC1"
         >FRC</gloss> 68 A 5159, June 16, 1958–June 20, 1958.</note> with <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> this morning embodying substance <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
        >Deptel</gloss> 4790<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4"><ref target="#d82">Document 82</ref>.</note>
       making a fourth point embodying Department’s suggestions on convocation of <gloss
        target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. President read letter very carefully and said he agreed with all
       four points. I had hastened to see him this morning because of knowledge that Cabinet was
       meeting at noon and I feared a decision might have been taken to ask for intervention before
       Department’s views reached President.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had summoned General this morning and
       had told him Colonels <persName>Salem</persName> and Adel Kadar Chehab must be dismissed.
       General complained Colonel <persName>Salem</persName> had worked with him for 15 years and
       despite his lack of resolution and timidity was an officer he was used to. General then
       tendered his resignation which <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> refused to
       accept. In typical Lebanese fashion interview ended indecisively, President apparently not
       insisting on dismissal of two officers by accepting <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>’s statement he would “reflect” on <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s demand. I offered free advice that in a question of military
       discipline no time was to be lost and if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> wanted
       these two officers ousted, he should move resolutely and at once. I suggested from my Latin
       American experience that the two officers be despatched on a military mission abroad.</p>
      <p>At least, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has started to move in on General
       and without asking foreign intervention as a condition precedent. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> found <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in a more
       constructive mood this morning. Although General expects further trouble in Beirut, he is
       removing one company from Tripoli and feels this reinforcement should enable security forces
       to deal with further outbreaks. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> begged General
       to mount at least one successful offensive and once more indicated the Chouf as a field of
       operation.</p>
      <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0173"/>
      <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> evidence reaching Embassy, and also
       British Ambassador, indicated opposition is by no means as strong or resolute as <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> supposed. In fact we thought opposition was about on its
       last legs. If, as <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> hoped, Army could achieve
       some sort of victory, however small, it might be sufficient to break back of revolution. I
       said all three ambassadors strongly felt it would likewise help if <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> himself would speak to Lebanese people. Middleton, who had seen me
       earlier this morning, said he felt vehemently <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       should straight out tell nation that issue of presidency should be decided by Parliament on
       July 24th than that he, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, would not be a
       candidate. I offered this personal suggestion as coming from myself and added that <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> might at the same time make statement of amnesty which
       he contemplated as reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 4629.<note n="5"
        xml:id="d86fn5"><ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> President nodded and said he
       thought both suggestions were good; but he did not indicate he would act on them. I made
       clear my own personal strong conviction that some sort of statement along these lines by
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should precede any announcement of a Lebanese
       appeal for western intervention.</p>
      <p>President said he had reflected on my suggestion (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
        4756)<note n="6" xml:id="d86fn6"><ref target="#d85"><hi rend="italic"
        >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> re calling special session of Parliament precedent to any request
       for intervention. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he felt this would not
       be feasible “because too many speeches would be made against intervention” by members of
       Opposition. I had distinct impression he did not feel Parliament would sufficiently support
       concept foreign military intervention. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> likewise
       laid great stress on advantage of secrecy and surprise.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: Both <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning see situation less darkly than yesterday. I
       believe presentation of Department’s views in writing will have salutary effect on Cabinet
       consideration of appeal for our military intervention and that prospect of Lebanon making
       such an appeal in next few days had distinctly receded. When I remarked to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that the three western ambassadors all felt Lebanon
       might still win its own way unaided and that intervention must be only a desperate last
       resort, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said “why say all three of you? It is
       all four of us.”</p>
      <p>Suggest Department pass London.</p>

       You should certainly disabuse <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> of thought that
       allied landings would be for purpose of facilitating removal of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. We have come to believe it is almost a sine qua non
       that Lebanon have had full recourse to orderly processes of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       before finally requesting and receiving friendly assistance (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1"

      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> went over problem of General in terms similar

        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Independence of Lebanon is paramount.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>This independence is threatened by exterior aggression and by internal

        <label>3.</label>

         is incumbent on Lebanese people to settle their own domestic difficulties.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>In consequence President and government call upon all Lebanese to unite; reaffirm
         decision of government not to amend constitution and, as far as <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> is concerned, clearly state question of his succession to office has
         not been and will not in future be a matter for debate. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> will explicitly renounce any intent to succeed himself but will
         explicitly proclaim his constitutional right to guide the destiny of Lebanon until end of
         his constitutional term.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>Because of continued external aggression and internal insurrection President and
         government of Lebanon in order to maintain independence and integrity of the republic have
         called upon the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Governments for temporary aid in
         maintaining that integrity and independence.</item>
       </list></p>
      <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0176"/>
      <p>Events are, however, moving very fast. If President is physically threatened and by
       telephone requests execution of Cabinet’s appeal for outside intervention I recommend token
       appearance of our two destroyers and am prepared to summon them by voice radio if Department
       concurs. Their appearance off Beirut might be decisive and could easily be explained as being
       necessitated by need to protect American lives and property.</p>
      <p>I have also given thought to personal welfare of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> and have suggested [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

       hideout in Lebanon than to flee country.</p>
      <p>My own personal feeling is that President and Council of Ministers are in a state of flap
       so far as he is concerned and funk so far as they are concerned.</p>
      <p>I continue to believe extreme measure of our intervention may be averted but, in Lebanon,

      <p>4812. I saw President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning at ten. He
       was very calm and inclined to be apologetic over last night’s excitement saying he had
       received intelligence from telephone monitoring reports that insurgents might launch an
       attack on Palace despite considerable military reinforcement which had been placed in
       vicinity of his residence. Matter now seemed well in hand. General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, with whom he had conferred immediately before receiving
       me, was bringing a company <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0179"/>of reinforcements to
       Beirut by sea from Halba using three landing craft which our navy had so promptly provided
       off Tripoli yesterday. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was deeply impressed by
       efficiency this operation.</p>
      <p>President said <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had now agreed to press more
       strongly in the Chouf. An operation would be mounted today against Beit Eddine and if all
       went well, this objective might be captured before day was out. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> was likewise determined to order General to undertake offensive in
       Beirut against certain known rebel strongholds which he said were manned largely by
       Palestinian-Egyptian-Syrian commandos. There would be considerable loss of life but he felt
       energetic action essential.</p>
      <p>On question of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s dismissal, <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> confirmed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS5"
        >Solh</persName> had been particularly restive at concept of continuing General in command
       (cf. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] 7505 and
        7480).<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">Neither found.</note> However, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> was not yet ready to dismiss General and preferred by system of daily
       pep talks to try to keep <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> moving. He appeared to
       base considerable hope on expectation of an imminent success in the Chouf with some increased
       activity against rebels in Beirut itself. Re question of dismissing the two colonels,
        <persName>Salem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, President said
       General was more “edrenle” this morning and had promised to consider a dossier of alleged
       treasonable activity which President would furnish him.</p>
      <p>I then made essential points in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4814<note n="3"
        xml:id="d91fn3"><ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note> re allied landings to

       have had full recourse to orderly processes of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> before
       finally requesting and receiving friendly assistance. I recalled in detail our original four
       points as set out <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4271<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4"
         ><ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note> and went over once more points made <gloss

         >Document 82</ref>.</note></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> showed some petulance when I summarized
       fourth point <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4271, exclaiming that he hoped US
       Government could be convinced once and for all that he had no intention to succeed himself in
       office. He said “I should long ago have left this country and taken a vacation were it not
       for fact that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his supporters attacked me
       because of my pro-western policy.”</p>
      <p>Although I had not at time of interview received <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
        4821,<note n="6" xml:id="d91fn6"><ref target="#d90"><hi rend="italic"
        >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> I went over once more letter handed President yesterday which
       paraphrased <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4790 and said in addition it seemed to
       me President might wish to give thought to need for making some public statement to Lebanese
       people and the world before requesting friendly intervention. <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148"
        facs="0180"/>I then went over five points in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
        4795.<note n="7" xml:id="d91fn7"><ref target="#d88">Document 88</ref>.</note><persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he agreed with each of them and would be willing to
       make a public statement if necessity arose. However, like me, he very much hoped that with
       new offensive plans of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, Lebanese security
       forces would be able to gain the upper hand. He was likewise somewhat more hopeful of
       efficacious aid from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers particularly since two
       Syrian military captured yesterday had given full and damning confessions which would
       presently be given to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer group.</p>
      <p>President at my request translated into French narrative paragraph of formal authorization
       to him to call for foreign intervention cited second paragraph <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
        >Embtel</gloss> 4795. In effect it stresses need for preserving independence and integrity
       of Lebanon, for protection of foreign lives and property, and authorizes President to call on
       “friendly powers” who had offered guarantees of Lebanon’s independence for “temporary
       assistance.”</p>
      <p>President once more emphasized this paper was for stand-by use and he had no intention of
       calling for any outside assistance except in extremis.</p>

      <p>There was considerable discussion of the political and military consequences of U.S.
       intervention in Lebanon and of U.S. nonintervention if the Government of Lebanon requests it.
       The military orders are three: to protect U.S. property, to assist the Lebanese authorities
       in maintaining their position, and to restore those authorities if they are overthrown. The
       first of these may in large part provide a U.S. constitutional basis for intervention but it
       involves the dilemma that intervention for this purpose smacks of imperialism.</p>
      <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0181"/>
      <p>The Secretary noted that the internal situation is highly confused and that there are two
       and perhaps three political forces at work each trying to get Lebanese military support.
       Whatever these facts, however, if we temporize when confronted by a request by the Government
       for military assistance, the almost immediate result will be erosion of confidence in us in
       other countries in the area and indeed in the world. We cannot take refuge in the “internal
       affairs” explanation because the Communists are using internal subversion throughout the
       area. At the same time, if we do go in even with Arab, e.g. Iraq and Jordan, participation,
       the governments of those countries will immediately be subjected from within to Communist
       inspired “anti-imperialist” pressure and will probably eventually fold up. Thus it can be
       argued that the present governments of the other Arab States will go down the drain whether
       we go in or not; it would just be a matter of timing.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> and General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> noted that we would probably then be confronted with
       spreading of the fighting; would we or should we be prepared to intervene elsewhere? Query:
       Should we thus get trapped into fighting the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> outside of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
       territory?</p>
      <p>On Congressional consultation there is still another dilemma. If we consult the Leadership
       before receiving a request, the consultation will leak back to Lebanon and provoke the
       request. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> thought the top four leaders
       could safely be taken into confidence and would probably approve intervention. Intervention
       in support of the United Nations will be more palatable in the Congress.</p>
      <p>What to do and how to do it in the United Nations was left to further discussion. The
       Secretary thought it better, given our constitutional problem and the dilemma that poses, to
       pitch our intervention in terms of support of the United Nations. He asked that further study
       be given the attacked draft of a statement<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">The attached draft
        statement, prepared by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, announced the
        introduction of U.S. Marines into Lebanon to protect foreign lives and property, and to
        enable the Government of Lebanon to preserve its independence and integrity. The statement
        indicated that the U.S. move would be closely coordinated with the United Nations, and that
        U.S. forces would be removed from Lebanon as soon as the reasons for their introduction had
        been corrected.</note> in conjunction with further study of strategy in the United
        Nations.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">Shortly after this meeting, the same people reconvened
        in <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s office to consider the possibility of
        action in conjunction with the United Nations. The consensus of the second meeting was that
        military intervention should not take place until a Security Council resolution calling for
        the establishment of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> armed force was introduced and
        predictably vetoed by the Soviet Union, and preferably not until the General Assembly,
        convoked under the Uniting for Peace provisions, had made a recommendation to send such an
        armed force to Lebanon. (Memorandum for the record, June 17; Department of State, Central

       <item>Directive for American Commander in Charge of Combined U.S./U.K. Military Operations in
        Lebanon</item>
      </list>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
      <p>We have obtained from J.C.S. an excerpt covering “Mission” and “Execution" from the plans
       for the combined U.S./U.K. military operations in Lebanon (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2"
        >Included in the microfiche supplement.</note> It is our understanding that these plans have
       been drawn up by U.S. and U.K. military planners in London and that as they stand they have
       “British agreement.” It is not clear if the Foreign Office has seen or approved the
       plans.</p>
      <p>The “Mission” stated in the military plans in several respects goes beyond the political
       objectives envisaged in the themes you approved on May 15 as our public position in the event
       of military intervention in Lebanon (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">Printed below.</note>
       which the British subsequently agreed to with the single reservation noted. The “Mission”
       also goes beyond our draft Political Directive to the Military Commanders (Tab C),<note n="4"
        xml:id="d93fn4">Telegram 4741 to Beirut, June 12, was attached at Tab C. It is included in
        the microfiche supplement.</note> which was based on the approved themes and a British draft
       political directive. The “Mission” of the military plans explicitly includes the following as
       objectives of the operations: <list>
        <label>(A)</label>
        <item>to support local friendly government, or,</item>
        <label>(B)</label>
        <item>if required, to re-establish the authority of a local friendly government, and</item>
        <label>(C)</label>
        <item>to assist in the maintenance of order.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In addition, under “Concept of Operations”, the last sentence of paragraph (5) contains the
       essentially political determination that “U.S.-British operations will continue until
       stability within Lebanon is established under a viable pro-Western government.”</p>
      <p>Because of circumstances that might exist at the time the operation is mounted, the
       “Execution” section of the military plans gives the commander considerable flexibility in
       carrying out his orders. Upon the entry into Lebanon at Beirut, his forces are to be prepared
       to cope <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>with organized resistance, and if fired upon
       would return fire. The plans provide that subsequently operations are to be expanded to other
       essential areas and facilities beyond Beirut. Air surveillance of the Lebanese frontiers will
       be conducted on both the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israeli borders. The plans
       call attention to the fact that subsequent developments might require our commitment of
       additional forces to accomplish the mission. (For example, this could result if there were
       widespread Moslem defections in the Lebanese Army or if it lacked the will to carry
       operations into opposition strongholds in the interior.)</p>
      <p>From the foregoing it is clear that these plans contain objectives much more explicit than
       our stated second objective in the themes: “to assist the Government of Lebanon in its
       military program for the preservation of the independence and integrity of Lebanon.” It is
       apparently the military view that the more explicit objectives stated in the plans are
       necessarily implied once a request for intervention has been accepted. In order for the
       military to achieve the objectives and in order to protect themselves, they must be in a
       position to pursue a vigorous course against any opposition—even if it comes from some
       segments of the Lebanese security forces. In that connection, there are sufficient
       unpredictable factors involved (such as whether General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> would be willing to act decisively against his compatriots among the
       opposition forces or the possibility of Moslem defections in the Lebanese security forces in
       the event of intervention) that it is probably militarily unrealistic for plans to be based
       on the thought that our forces could land and remain within the Beirut area, thus
       theoretically releasing the Lebanese forces to deal expeditiously with the opposition outside
       of the Beirut area and thereupon permitting the timely withdrawal of our military forces. It
       would appear that once having entered at Beirut our forces might well find it necessary to
       take action outside of the capital. We understand informally from the military that much
       larger forces would have to be called in if it should become necessary to expand the
       operations into the interior.</p>

      <p>The Ambassador said that <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Charles Malik</persName> two days ago
       had told Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Pierson Dixon</persName> that it would be a great
       tragedy if the effort now being made to solve the Lebanese crisis were restricted to that
       problem alone. An attempt should be made to resolve the underlying problems such as that of
       Syria. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that what was going on was a
       contest between <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and the West versus <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the East. The underlying problems might be solved if
       the Lebanese crisis should spread or even if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       manages to win out. By so doing he would set <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       back and permit the beginning of the gradual weakening of Syria. In <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s view, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       should remain beyond his present Presidential term.</p>
      <p>The British Ambassador commented that there might be a successful pro-<persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> coup against <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> which would present us with a terrible problem. Sir Harold expressed
       great concern over the fact that we seemed to have no choice but to watch events in Lebanon
       deteriorate.</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented that he saw no satisfactory solution to the Lebanese problem except
       through the lawful government’s working one out with all possible assistance except armed
       intervention. If the Lebanese called for the latter, and if we responded, there would be a
       wave of anti-Western sentiment which would sweep away our friends in Jordan, Iraq and Saudi
       Arabia and turn the Lebanese against us. If we did not respond, we would get the same results
       less abruptly in the Arab countries. However, if we failed to respond the effect on our
       friends in the countries peripheral to the Arab world would be very bad, while these friends
       would be encouraged if we went into Lebanon. The Secretary concluded that we must put every
       possible pressure on the Lebanese to solve this matter themselves.</p>
      <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0186"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> commented that the possibilities for
       solving the Lebanese crisis, as he saw them were two. One was that the Lebanese would stand
       firm and put down the insurrection by military means. The prospects were dim but by such
       steps as making political changes or firing General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>, the government’s position might be improved and that of the opposition
       weakened. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> felt that there must be some
       kind of compromise on the part of the government. The second solution would be for <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to be replaced by a coup d’etat. The danger here was
       that we could not be certain who would come in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> thought we should concentrate on the first approach and get <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to make concessions which would not affect the basic
       issue of Lebanese sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The Secretary believed it would be dangerous for us to tell <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> that he should make concessions. He might be a better judge of his
       interests than we are. We should, however, disabuse him of any thought that he has a blank
       check from us with regard to military intervention. He should also be under no illusion that
       by calling us in he can win the battle against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
       On the contrary, he would lose it. The Secretary thought our Ambassadors should summarize to
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> our thinking as follows: There can be no
       satisfactory solution of the crisis other than one carried out by the Government of Lebanon
       itself. We are helping as much as possible. If we should be called on to intervene
       militarily, this would not contribute to the defeat of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> but would give him an opportunity to increase his attacks on the Lebanese
       Government, to undermine Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and to increase the strength of the
       opposition in Lebanon. Of course we could hold on wherever our troops were, but a happy and
       prosperous Lebanon would not result from foreign military intervention. The Secretary also
       thought that we should not press <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> concerning
       specific political sources of action or even with regard to his future status. We should tell
       him that we are not concerned with constitutional factors and would not object if, after this
       crisis is solved, he wished to stay on as President. We should not destroy <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s heart or courage by pressing him to compromise with
       the opposition.</p>
      <p>It was commented to the Secretary that a basic assumption in the above approach was that
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could in reality, with his own resources and
       aided by foreign help short of intervention, win out. Doubt was expressed that this was so
       and indeed it was felt that the government’s military position was bound to get progressively
       weaker and that the day when <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would feel forced
       to request foreign intervention was inexorably growing closer. Thus, in effect, a solution of
       the problem by the Lebanese themselves might, for one reason or another, turn out to be
       impossible.</p>
      <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0187"/>
      <p>It was agreed that this problem would be further discussed after London had had a chance to
       comment on the considerations put forward during the meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2"
         ><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> returned to the Department the next day and
        informed <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that he had called <persName
         corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> to get his reaction to the conversation of the
        previous afternoon concerning Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> agreed
        that it would be desirable to emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> the
        unfavorable consequences of Western intervention, and to stress the necessity of full
        recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> processes. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
         >Lloyd</persName> felt, however, that if faced with a Lebanese request for military
        intervention, it would be necessary to respond positively. (Memorandum of conversation, June

      <head>95. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on June 19 on significant world developments
       affecting U.S. security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered the
       following assessment of the situation in Lebanon: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Turning to the situation in Lebanon, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
          Dulles</persName> said that Beirut was quiet last night after a day of sporadic fighting.
         President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had apparently panicked on the
         night of June 16 and had secured from his cabinet written permission to call for the
         intervention of U.S. and U.K. troops if he thought such intervention necessary. Recovering
         his poise, President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had since decided not to
         make use of the permission given him by the cabinet. However, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> still feels that the Chief of Staff, General <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, could break the back of the rebel resistance if he
         would move vigorously. He is not moving very vigorously, continued Mr. <persName
          corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, and it now appears that a group of army officers is
         engaged in a plot directed against both General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> and the rebels. This officer group had planned a coup to occur on the
         night of June 17. The coup had not come off and might not come off. Such a coup would not
         be anti-western in its results and might indeed actually be pro-Western because it was the
         objective of this military group to get rid of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> and to institute a stronger military leadership for the Lebanese armed
         forces. Meanwhile, the Iraqi and Jordanian authorities feel that our intervention will
         prove necessary. Indeed, they themselves may intervene.</p>
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say that the Damascus radio
         was very active in behalf of the rebels in Lebanon and that there was strong evidence of a
         highly confidential nature that the United Arab Republic was providing tactical direction
         to the rebel forces in Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
         concluded his comments on this subject by prophesying a series of difficult days ahead for
         the U.S. There seemed to be some evidence that Hammerskjold had been in touch with
          <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> which could prove to be a serious matter if
         true.” (Memorandum of discussion <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0188"/>at the 369th

      <p>4895. I called this morning on President. He said he had been working as I came in on text
       of written appeal for allied intervention to use in case of necessity. I had previously [<hi

      <p>President expressed skepticism whether Hammerskjold in two-day visit<note n="2"
        xml:id="d96fn2">Secretary-General Hammarskjöld visited Beirut June 19–20 to participate in
        the first formal meetings of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Observation Group.
        While in Beirut, he discussed the Lebanon crisis with President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

       said since passage of June eleventh resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">See <ref
         target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> there had been a much accelerated build-up of arms
       and infiltration of partisan bands from Syria. He said “Our defense forces are in static
       positions. They are stuck everywhere—in Beirut, in Tripoli, in The Bekaa. Against them the
       enemy is increasing his potential.” <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> went on to
       say that in his judgment the crisis was upon him. He asked “Must I wait until catastrophe
       bursts on my head or should I not take action to try to avert catastrophe?”</p>

      <p>I then said I had received visit early this morning from Minister Finance who described
       three-hour talk he had yesterday with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.
       According to <persName corresp="#p_EP2">Pierre Edde</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> had stated it was necessary to find a political truce. General was quoted
       as saying he was certain he could negotiate an armistice with opposition but was not sure
       what attitude would be taken by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. I then read
       out to President excerpts from paragraphs four and seven of Lodge’s 1516 to the
        Secretary<note n="6" xml:id="d96fn6">Telegram 1516 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
         >USUN</gloss>, June 17, was repeated for information to Beirut. (Department of State,

         <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s cable to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName>, and he suggested that <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
        did not understand the international implications of failing to respond to a call from
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for military assistance. (Eisenhower Library,
         <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> Papers, General Telephone Conversations) The
        telegram and the transcript of the telephone conversation are included in the microfiche
        supplement.</note> in which Ambassador Lodge twice emphasizes need for political action in
       Lebanon including political compromise to find a solution which might save us all from grave
       consequences of military intervention. I asked straight out if President could not bring
       himself to contemplate some sort of a political and military cease-fire without prejudice to
       his position along lines suggested to Minister of Finance by General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>President muttered that he did not know what <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       had in mind. General was taking the day off in Junieh, apparently “confined to his bed.” I
       suggested it would be a matter of utmost urgency to ascertain if General could in fact
       negotiate a truce. I thought if this could be done and with presence of Hammerskjold and
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers, it might then be possible to compel <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to cease further infiltration and permit Lebanon to work
       out its own political problems free of any foreign intervention.</p>
      <p>President was entering increasingly upon a black mood as conversation continued and finally
       with a show of resignation tapped wireless bulletin bearing report of President <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s press conference and exclaimed “With this I cannot
       now lodge any request for aid; I must ask you clearly to find out where I stand.” I said I
       would immediately report our conversation and endeavor to secure elucidation.</p>
      <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0190"/>
      <p>My overall impression was that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> feels cornered
       and desperate. He does not believe <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers or <gloss
        target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> will be able to help him quickly enough; he thinks forces of
       opposition are growing stronger and intend to reach a military decision before <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can act; and he now doubts US readiness to intervene before
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, which he is convinced will be inadequate and too
       late. At the same time, saddled with incubus of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> as if he were the Old Man of the Sea, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> is stubbornly unwilling to take those last measures of personal
       sacrifice which might assure a political compromise averting his own defeat.</p>

       seek urgent meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and inform him that I
       have asked you to pass to him following information and views to which I hope he will give
       most serious consideration. Presentation should be oral but slowly and carefully made.
       (Inform your British colleague.)</p>
      <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s remarks at Press Conference
       June 18 should be regarded within context statements we have already made to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> re <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in this
       matter, namely that since <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> has itself invoked and received
       support from <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> US would find it very awkward to act
       militarily while it was still uncertain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would be
       inadequate and where responsibility of collapse of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort
       would be generally attributed to US. We have as <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       knows come to believe that it is almost a sine qua non that Lebanon have full recourse <pb
        n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0191"/>to orderly processes of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> before finally requesting or receiving friendly military forces. Minimum action
       would seem to be convocation of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> again in emergency
       session.</p>
      <p>President’s words should in no way be interpreted as meaning that we would require the
       concurrence or recommendation of <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> prior to military
       assistance to <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> but some further reference to <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is necessary, and undoubtedly <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
       >SYG</gloss>’s views would carry weight with other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members.
       We continue ready to take exceptional measures on behalf of Lebanon if such measures are
       absolutely essential and factors set forth in Deptels 4271, 4482, 4790 and 4814<note n="3"
        xml:id="d97fn3"><ref target="#d31">Documents 31</ref>, <ref target="#d49">49</ref>, <ref
         target="#d82">82</ref>, and <ref target="#d87">87</ref>.</note> are present. We retain this
       determination despite apprehension which possibility of such action has aroused in <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and among friendly countries in western Europe and Latin
       America.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should be reassured of our full confidence in
       him personally. Tell him that we realize that he is the symbol of Lebanon’s determination to
       defend its independence and integrity and the extensive support we have provided to the
       government over which he presides should convince him of our determination to stand by him in
       his efforts to resolve this crisis. We realize that we cannot and should not offer him
       specific advice with regard to political moves which he might make within Lebanon. He is the
       best judge of the action in this field which may be in the best interests of Lebanese
       independence.</p>
      <p>We also believe that Lebanon has the capacity to solve this crisis without use of foreign
       military forces, and we are prepared to give all appropriate assistance to this end. While
       perhaps it would be better in some situation to request forces than not to, we do not
       consider that the introduction of Western forces into Lebanon would either solve the present
       crisis or enhance Lebanon’s long term position in the area. We believe that intervention
       would have the opposite effect since intervention in circumstances as they have been
       developing could well bring about serious confessional strife in Lebanon and set into train
       indigenous trends toward Lebanon’s ultimate territorial partition or truncation. Lebanon’s
       integrity would be assured only as long as foreign forces remained on Lebanese soil.
       Moreover, intervention could and probably would lead to solidification of opposition
       throughout Moslem world not only to Christians in Lebanon but to the West in general. We have
       also noted growing indication that allied military intervention would be viewed with
       repugnance even by many Lebanese Christians.</p>
      <p>In these circumstances, there is a grave danger if not certainty that reaction in the Near
       Eastern area to intervention would represent a victory for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> in that there would be aroused strong popular feeling which could well
       sweep away regimes of pro-Western Arab <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0192"/>leaders in
       other countries. In this event the prospects of diminishing Western position in the Arab
       world, which is one of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s prime objectives,
       would be greatly furthered.</p>
      <p>For these reasons we take this occasion to urge <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to do everything in his power to avoid a situation in which a request
       for intervention might be required. He should know that he will have our full backing in his
       efforts to safeguard Lebanese independence and integrity by other means.</p>

          <label>(A)</label>
          <item>He could most earnestly assure the Secretary that he would not request US
           intervention “unless the knife is at my throat.” Under these circumstances he thought our
           intervention would seem quite logical and responsive to a truly emergency need.</item>
          <label>(B)</label>
          <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said wryly he was in paradoxical
           position of being the Arab leader who resisted allied intervention at same time other
           Arab leaders were pressing him to call for intervention. He said he had received urgent
           advice from governments of Iraq, Jordan, Turkey and Iran to request allied military
           assistance immediately in Lebanon.</item>
          <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0193"/>
          <label>(C)</label>
          <item>President said he must express a dissent to conclusion in last sentence fifth
           paragraph reference telegram that allied military intervention would be viewed with
           repugnance even by many Lebanese Christians. President said he thought 99 percent of
           Christians in this country would welcome such intervention. He said there were certain
           Christian elements, such as Henri Pharaon, who might make verbal protests but at same
           time would be secretly delighted that their wealth would be protected by foreign troops.
           As for Moslems, although here <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> hesitated, he
           said perhaps 25 percent (largely the commercial and land-owning classes) would welcome
           intervention.</item>
          <label>(D)</label>
          <item><p>Re final paragraph reference telegram I asked President what “other means” he
            might use to safeguard Lebanese independence and integrity with assurance of our full
            backing. He replied he did not at moment see any possibility of a move in political
            field because direction of the revolution had now passed out of hands of local leaders
            and was in hands of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Cairo. (See <gloss
             target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 4937<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">After Hammarskjöld
             left Lebanon on June 20, he visited Amman, Jerusalem, and Cairo to discuss a possible
             solution to the Middle East crisis. In telegram 4937 from Beirut, June 20, <persName
              corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported that he had outlined to <persName
              corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> the line which he felt Hammarskjöld should take in
             his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Cairo. He felt
             that Hammarskjöld ask <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> for assurances that
             the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would comply with the Security Council
             resolution of June 11, and should indicate that he was setting up a set of indicators
             against which he would publicly measure compliance. (<hi rend="italic"
             >Ibid.</hi>)</note> for my suggestions to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
            re possible agenda for a Hammarskjold–<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
            interview.) He was convinced <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> intends to go
            all out to defeat him with Jordan next on the list. To my inquiry as to possibility of
            Lebanese themselves being able to negotiate a cease-fire and some sort of political
            armistice, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> merely shook his head.</p>
           <p>Re military means of safeguarding Lebanese independence and integrity, <persName
             corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he needed some sort of military victory. Once
            more he had demanded of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
            preparation of an operational plan for an attack on the Chouf. He had insisted this plan
            be ready by 9:15 tomorrow morning. With the company and a half which Lebanese Army has
            in the Chouf plus artillery, heavy mortars and air striking power he was convinced a
            victory could be won over Jumblat Druzes. If he has some sort of victory, President was
            then willing to consider what steps he might take along lines of those urged by
            Middleton as reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 4862.<note n="5"
             xml:id="d98fn5">According to telegram 4862 from Beirut, June 18, Ambassador <persName
              corresp="#p_MSG1">Middleton</persName>, on instructions from London, had urged
              <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to make a nationwide radio broadcast
             calling on all citizens to lay down their arms within 24 hours, and offering a general
             amnesty to all who had not committed personal crimes. If, within 24 hours of this
             appeal, hostilities had not ceased, <persName corresp="#p_MSG1">Middleton</persName>
             advised <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to order General <persName
              corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to deal with utmost severity with any dissident
             elements. If <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> demurred or delayed,
              <persName corresp="#p_MSG1">Middleton</persName> advised that he should be replaced by
             a more energetic commander. And if, after having recourse to these measures, the crisis
             still continued, Middleton concluded that it would then be possible to contemplate
             allied intervention as a last recourse. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/6–1858;
             included in the microfiche supplement)</note> British Ambassador tells me <pb n="162"

            similar word to him through his oriental counselor this morning.</p>
           <p>As a third measure which might be taken within framework of last paragraph reference
            telegram, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he thought presence here as
            soon as possible of our six Hawker Hunters would have a valuable psychological effect. I
            said British <gloss target="#t_RAF1">RAF</gloss> training mission had expressed grave
            misgivings on this point since it would mean in order to utilize these aircraft taking
            out of active service Lebanon’s six best pilots at a time they were needed most. British
            also had misgivings on leaving highly expensive aircraft in Lebanon without pilots to
            fly them. Nevertheless I said I would pass on <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
             >Chamoun</persName>’s request for expediting delivery of Hawker Hunters.<note n="6"
             xml:id="d98fn6">In telegram 4918 to Beirut, the Department responded that British
             suppliers had expressed some hope of delivering the new aircraft within 3–4 weeks. The
             Department added, however, that the misgivings of the <gloss target="#t_RAF1"
              >RAF</gloss> training mission seemed well-founded.</note></p></item>
          <label>(E)</label>
          <item>On security situation generally I told President General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
            >Chehab</persName> last night had seemed more confident and in particular had described
           to me his dispositions for defense of Beirut. It seemed to me <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
            >Chehab</persName> now had sufficient strength (element constituting almost a battalion)
           and had so disposed firepower that he could control any mob emerging from the Basta. I
           also thought <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s provisions for defense of
           Palace were much improved. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had
           personally gone over defense plans and completely shared this view. He said however there
           was bitter fighting last night in Tripoli with heavy loss of life when army opened up
           with artillery against unremitting fire.</item>
         </list></p></item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>Conclusion: <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was on upswing of his diurnal
        shift in mood. Long visit [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
         declassified</hi>] made with him last night at my request had done much to calm his nerves
        and net effect of Secretary’s message was to buoy him up. However we must not be blind to
        fact he is still repeating endless operation of demanding from General <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> another battle plan “within 24 hours" none of which has
        yet been executed; and he is making no attempt either to detach elements of opposition, to
        reach a cease-fire and political armistice, or to find that political formula which Lodge
         (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>’s 1516)<note n="7" xml:id="d98fn7">See <ref
          target="#d96fn6">footnote 6, Document 96</ref>.</note> correctly points out is an
        essential element to a solution without great power intervention. (Regrettably on other hand
        diehard opposition also is not seeking a solution which would be acceptable to <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s or our interest.)</item>

       have the potential to do this. The Sec said our people have the impression this has not much

       and also they agreed Hammarskjold is not bucking it up very much. A said he is just stopping
       the fighting while there and he may have taken some of the morale away from our side. The Sec
       said they fear he is going to produce a Munich and the Sec thinks the fear is not without
       justification. The Sec referred to Ben Gurion’s anxiety and read from the paper.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d99fn3">Israeli Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Abba Eban</persName> conveyed
        this anxiety in a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> on June

        government to the effect that <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> observers in Lebanon were
        seeking to act as mediators. Israel felt that it was critical that the United Nations should
        not confer any status on the rebels in Lebanon. Under the Charter, the United Nations was
        only authorized to treat with governments. To do otherwise, <persName corresp="#p_EA3"

       would have deteriorated to the point where it will be difficult to do it. It will take time

       and going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—during this he will have made himself
       quite a target. The Sec said we have a secret message to which he thinks we are making no

      <p>Lord Hood this morning brought over a message from <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn
        Lloyd</persName> in which the Foreign Secretary suggested that the US and <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> urgently recommend to President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> that he request of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
        >Hammarskjold</persName> that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force for Lebanon be
       established. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> were to recommend such
       action to the Security Council, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> believed
       there would be a much better chance of getting a favorable <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
       attitude. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force would not have any representatives of
       the major powers but would be utilized to carry out police action. This procedure would
       eliminate the need for US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> requested the Secretary’s urgent reaction.</p>
      <p>The Secretary was consulted and believed that this step would be unwise. He felt that it
       might give President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> the idea that we were
       trying to evade our commitments or possibly that this was merely a prior formality which he
       would have to undergo in advance of requesting our intervention. The Secretary also said that
       he did not <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0197"/>want to approach <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> without first discussing the matter with the Secretary
       General and he believed the Secretary General had this type of idea very much in mind
       already.</p>
      <p>I later conveyed the above conversation with the Secretary to Mr. <persName>Weir</persName>

      <p>The Secretary observed that the fact of outside intervention in the Lebanese crisis was
       demonstrable and recalled that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in its consideration of
       the Atlantic Treaty had stated insurrection stimulated from without was aggression. The
       Secretary said that if there were no protection against this kind of thing the Communists
       would indeed have developed a technique which was invincible. The question of our possible
       intervention posed a difficult problem from a juridical standpoint and would be difficult in
       the United Nations. Yet the only thing worse than intervening if requested to do so by the
       Lebanese Government would be not to go in. Our intervention would probably result in the
       Governments of Jordan and Iraq being swept away and the Lebanese Government itself probably
       would not survive our withdrawal. The situation would of course be better if we went in under
       United Nations auspices. On the other hand if we were called upon and did not respond, the
       Governments of Jordan and Iraq would also be overthrown. In this respect there was little
       difference either way. The real difference lay with the peripheral countries. If we did not
       respond, it would gravely shake the confidence of the peripheral countries and in that case
       the consequences of our failure to act would not be limited to the Arab countries alone but
       would undermine the Northern Tier, Sudan and Libya. Obviously the best thing would be for
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to work out a solution himself. Accordingly,
       our first priority should be to step up United Nations help but the United Nations should not
       get in a position between the government and the rebels. The eventual government which would
       emerge from such a resolution of the problem would not be a <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> government since its term was ending and he had privately said he would
       not run again for office. The new government would not be as pro-Western as <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> but might hold the balance between the West on the one
       hand and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Soviet influence on the other.</p>
      <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0199"/>
      <p>With reference to the language of the Middle East resolution, Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> asked what was meant by the “independence” of Lebanon,
       to which the Secretary replied it meant independence from the United Arab Republic and the
       Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> commented that our intervention would
       have very serious consequences and he wondered whether we had been sufficiently ruthless in
       our efforts to get a political compromise or to get <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> to call this thing off. He noted that “fomenting civil strife” was part
       of the Essentials of Peace Resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">U.N. doc. A/RES/290(IV),
        December 1, 1949.</note> but he thought that sending in troops was not the way to deal with
       this problem. We should rather seek to outmaneuver and outsubvert the other side. However, if
       this matter should be raised in the United Nations, it would require very vigorous action. He
       would have to have all useful intelligence bearing on the case declassified so that he could
       undertake a comprehensive recitation of all the facts which might take up a whole afternoon
       session. This was a case in which we would have to speak to the smaller nations and endeavor
       to make this ambiguous Communist challenge appear unambiguous. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stressed the importance of his having hard facts. At
       this point the available intelligence material was examined and it was agreed that as much as
       possible should be declassified and provided Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
        >Lodge</persName> as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p>The Secretary observed that what was at stake here was the whole periphery of the Soviet
       Union. Our failure to respond to the Lebanese request for intervention might be technically
       justified since the conditions we attached to such intervention have not and will not be met.
       Yet the basic fact is that Lebanon is the most pro-Western Arab government in the area. It
       accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine. Our failure to respond would destroy the confidence in us
       of all the countries on the Soviet periphery throughout the Middle and Far East.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> observed that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his associates were clearly offenders against
       international law in this case and that we were in the position of having to take the law
       into our own hands. What was needed was to create a situation in the United Nations in which
       action could be taken in the name of international law. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
        >Quarles</persName> also pointed out that in the meeting presided over by Governor <persName
        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> a few days earlier general agreement had been reached
       that full recourse to the United Nations should be had, including both the Security Council
       and the General Assembly.</p>
      <p>The Secretary observed that as far as the United Nations was concerned, a great deal would
       depend on the evidence which the United Nations observers would send back and finally he
       stressed the importance in any intervention of having the participation of such non-European
       powers as Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan.</p>

      <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Foster</hi>: I write this letter because I did not have time at
       the conference at your house yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See <ref target="#d102"
          ><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> to express all my thoughts about the use of
       troops in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Over much of my life I have given a lot of thought to this subject and while troops are
       absolutely indispensable under certain conditions, they are, under certain others, a method
       which has tremendous limitations. In fact, under certain conditions, for every problem that
       you solve with troops, you create ten others.</p>
      <p>I suggest, therefore, that we have very definite ideas on the following:</p>
      <p>How are we going to get our troops out once we have got them in?</p>
      <p>How long shall they remain?</p>
      <p>What will the formula be for getting them out?</p>
      <p>What will the formula be for holding elections in Lebanon while our troops are there?</p>
      <p>What happens if the elections should go definitely against us?</p>
      <p>If no elections occur for a long time, what will the policy be concerning meetings of the
       Parliament and votes in Parliament?</p>
      <p>And what if the votes in Parliament turn strongly against the United States troops?</p>
      <p>You remember that we got our troops into Korea and we were unable to get them out until we
       had held a national election in this country, even though it was perfectly obvious that they
       should have come out long before they did.</p>
      <p>Here is another question to which we should have a pretty clear answer in our own
       minds:</p>
      <p>What do we do about the Iraqi and Jordanian governments? Under the present policy, I
       suppose that they would be just as much entitled to our assistance as Lebanon—if they decided
       to ask for it. Are we prepared to go into those countries too?</p>
      <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0201"/>
      <p>If intervention in Lebanon by U.S. troops becomes unavoidable it would be very much better
       for U.S. troops to go in alone. The world sees us in an entirely different light than it sees
       the U.K. and France.</p>
      <p>If we go in alone the contrast with <persName>Suez</persName> would be brought out.</p>
      <p>In the long run the decision might save American lives because passions might not be so
       bitter.</p>
      <p>I have just sent you a wire telling you of <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
        >Hammarskjold</persName>’s latest dispatch to the United Nations about his conversation with
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">Reference is to
        telegram 1547 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, for the Secretary from <persName

         >Lodge</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> had just
        telephoned to convey a message from Hammarskjöld in Cairo. Hammarskjöld said he was “most
        satisfied” with last night’s “operation.” He urged everyone to give the “operation” a
        chance, and “give time for the bandages to be removed from the patient.” (Department of
        State, Central Files, 320.5783A/6–2358)</note> This conversation, plus the efforts at
       compromise being made at Beirut, indicate a better chance for some political compromise than
       there has been for some time. Let’s hope something can be worked out which will prevent us
       from facing the horrible alternatives which you so eloquently described! I hope that the next
       few days show us some daylight at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p>If do it we must, let us leave no stone unturned to <hi rend="italic">present</hi> it
        properly.<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
        responded on June 25 with a letter in which he assured <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
         >Lodge</persName> that the “hard questions” posed by <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
         >Lodge</persName> were being given a great deal of thought. He added: “The big question to
        my mind is must we reconcile ourselves to a world in which the independence of small nations
        can be effectively destroyed by means of armed insurrection fomented, directed, and
        augmented from without. If so, we are in a period reminiscent of Manchuria, Abyssinia, and
        Czechoslovakia. The technique is slightly different, but the substance is the same.” He
        concluded that the solution to the Lebanon crisis “must, I think, be something other than a
        Munich which will in fact end the independence of Lebanon and make it, in fact if not in
        form, a dependency of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and perhaps, realistically, of

      <p>Mr. <persName>Lucet</persName> said he was calling on urgent instructions from the Foreign
       Office.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Lucet</persName> recalled that in a meeting with the French Ambassador last
       Friday, the Secretary had described the complications which might arise if French troops were
       to participate in a US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military intervention in
        Lebanon.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">According to a summary of the June 20 meeting,
        transmitted to Paris in telegram 4828, June 20, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
         >Dulles</persName> emphasized to Ambassador Alphand that French participation in a military
        intervention in Lebanon would prejudice the effort because of opposition to France in the
        Arab world arising out of the Algerian problem and because of close French ties with Israel.
         (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/6–2058; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> The Foreign Office had now instructed the French Ambassador to inform the
       Department on an urgent basis that (1) it would, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, be far
       better if military intervention in Lebanon could be avoided altogether, and (2) if Western
       military intervention were decided upon it would be necessary for the French to participate
       in it. As the Department was aware, a French cruiser and patrol boat were now off the shores
       of Lebanon. If a request from President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> for
       military intervention were received, the ships would be obliged to enter the port of Beirut.
       France has 4000 nationals in Lebanon as well as important economic and cultural interests
       which it must protect. If military intervention is undertaken by the West, even without a
       request from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, either inside or outside the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the French would wish to participate.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said he appreciated the promptness of
       the French Embassy in bringing this to our attention since it would be an important
       consideration in any decision we might take. The complications involved in French
       participation in military intervention in Lebanon had already been explained to Ambassador
       Alphand by the Secretary. At best a response to a call for military intervention would
       present many complications. The problem was to incur as little unfavorable <pb n="171"
        xml:id="pg_171" facs="0203"/>reaction as possible not only in Lebanon but in other Arab
       countries. These considerations had no doubt been taken into account by the Foreign Office
       prior to the despatch of its message.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Lucet</persName> said that on May 16 President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> had asked the French Government to be ready to intervene should the need
       arise. More recently, the Ambassador had talked with Prime Minister <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, who had stated that it would be absolutely necessary for
       the French to participate in any western military action in Lebanon. The Lebanese, Mr.
        <persName>Lucet</persName> added, would be pleased to have the French participating.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> pointed out the necessity for
       evaluating the effects of intervention not only on the Lebanese but also on the Iraqis and
       Jordanians and, to a lesser extent, on the Saudis and the Sudanese. In concluding that French
       participation would complicate military intervention, we were primarily concerned with the
       adverse reaction not so much in Lebanon as in the other Arab countries.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Lucet</persName> reiterated that he was acting on instructions from Paris. He
       must, he said, insist on the first of the two points, i.e., that military intervention in
       Lebanon should be avoided if it were at all possible. He requested on behalf of the
       Ambassador that this information be passed to the Secretary.</p>

      <p>The Secretary led off the conversation by mentioning that the Euratom agreements had been
       sent to the Congress this morning by the President and stressed the importance he attached to
       their receiving prompt attention and action by the Congress.</p>
      <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0204"/>
      <p>The Secretary said that he wished to discuss the situation in Lebanon. He recalled the
       meeting which he had had with this group (and others) at the Capitol last May 15 and
       indicated that he wished to bring them up to date on developments which had taken place in
       the intervening period. The Secretary explained that the threat to the integrity of Lebanon
       continued but that the situation had become somewhat more complicated since his earlier
       meeting with the group. There was no question but what there had been considerable
       infiltration of personnel and equipment into Lebanon across the border from Syria and that
       this outside help had made a marked contribution to the disorders which have taken place in
       the country. The major source of outside agitation, however, was by radio broadcasts
       calculated to arouse the dissident elements against the government. The <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers could be helpful in deterring further arms and
       personnel from coming across the border but this would not in itself solve the situation
       because of the personnel and arms which were already in place within the country.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that up to now we had difficulty in getting the government to move
       effectively against the dissident forces within their country. He then described the internal
       political situation among the pro-Western elements in Lebanon and discussed, in particular,
       the relationship between President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. He mentioned the possibility of the situation
       deteriorating into what is known in the area as a “confessional war.” He added that there
       were beginning to be some desertions of Moslems from the Army.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that as he had indicated at the earlier meeting, we had, some five weeks
       ago, given assurances to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that under certain
       conditions we would be prepared to send troops to Lebanon. These conditions included, among
       others, that there would be an official request by the Lebanese government for us to do so
       and that the government of Lebanon would have taken their case to the United Nations.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that if we should be called upon to send troops to Lebanon, we would be
       faced with a very serious dilemma. If we did send troops, the repercussions elsewhere in the
       Arab world would be extremely serious and the position of our friends in other countries in
       the Middle East would be jeopardized. Our move would be supported by a number of the
       governments of these states but it would not be popular with large portions of their
       populations. In addition, he pointed out that once we went in, we would probably have to stay
       in the Middle East until Nasserism had run its course. On the other hand, if we did not send
       troops and Lebanon was taken over by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the position of
       other friendly governments in the Middle East would also be in great danger and it probably
       would only be a matter of time before they, too, would be taken over by the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. In addition, if we <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0205"
       />failed to take action when one of our friends in the world was jeopardized, it would have a
       very serious effect on certain of our allies around the Soviet-Sino periphery. In this
       connection, he mentioned Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Thailand, Viet-Nam, and the Republic of
       China, who would all view our failure to act as an indication of lack of willingness to
       support our friends when they are in trouble. The overall consequences of not going in if
       asked would therefore be extremely damaging—probably more so than if we did go in.</p>
      <p>But the Secretary went on to say that it was clear that difficult consequences would follow
       regardless of which course we chose in the face of a request by Lebanon for American troops.
       For this reason, we were at the present time devoting our efforts to trying to prevent the
       situation from developing to the point where such a request would be forthcoming. In this
       connection, we were supporting the present United Nations effort and doing what we could to
       strengthen the effectiveness of the Lebanese government in dealing with the disorders. We are
       hoping that a combined United Nations effort on the borders and the government effort within
       the country can bring the situation under control.</p>
      <p>The Secretary mentioned that the strongest card we have to play with <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in the present situation is the fact that if he does not
       discontinue <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> efforts to take over Lebanon, President
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> may cash the check which we gave him five
       weeks ago. The Secretary said that if we do have to send troops to Lebanon, we would not do
       so under the Middle East Resolution but on the grounds of protecting our interests in the
       area. (In this connection, however, the Secretary referred to the language in the Middle East
       Resolution which declared that the “United States regards as vital to the national interest
       and world peace the preservation of the independence and integrity of the nations of the
       Middle East.”)</p>
      <p>The Secretary then talked generally about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
       tactics and objectives in the Middle East. He likened <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s Pan Arabism to Hitler’s Pan Germanism. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> is a demagogue who can stir up the crowds with his speeches but he has
       not demonstrated, and probably does not have, any capacity to consolidate the gains he has
       made. The Secretary cited the fact that he had succeeded in taking over Syria but instead of
       going to work on the legal, administrative, and economic problems involved in consolidating
       this accomplishment, he had directed his attention to taking over another country. The
       Secretary felt that in the end <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would become
       over extended and he would be brought down by the problems which he had created for himself.
       In response to a question, the Secretary said that he thought that the Russians probably had
       made a similar assessment of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s future. He
       thought the Russians were quite willing to use <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       to displace <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0206"/>the pro-Western elements in the Middle
       East and then plan on moving in on the heels of his downfall and taking over the area for
       themselves.</p>
      <p>The question was asked why Syria seemed to go into the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> camp so easily. The Secretary said that he thought this has been the
       result of fear on the part of many Syrians that if they did not go over to <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, they would be taken over by the Communists.</p>
      <p>The question was asked that if we sent troops into Lebanon would we not eventually have to
       send them into other countries in the Middle East such as Jordan and Iraq. The Secretary said
       that this was a possibility and was another reason why we hoped we would not have to go into
       Lebanon.</p>
      <p>The Secretary was asked whether we had any ability through <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
        >CIA</gloss> to organize our own indigenous forces which could be used to combat the
       insurrectionists. It was suggested that many Turks and others from the area looked like
       Lebanese and could perhaps be infiltrated as counter forces. The Secretary did not give a
       direct answer to this question, although he did mention that consideration had been given
       sometime ago to the formation of a freedom corps made up of nationalities which could be used
       for occasions such as this. He also made reference to the difficulties of this kind of covert
       activity, citing the humiliating experience which King <persName corresp="#p_SAA5"
        >Saud</persName> had recently undergone when an operation of his backfired.</p>
      <p>The Secretary was asked whether DeGaulle was making progress and he replied that the French
       Premier was making considerable progress. The Secretary paid a tribute to the work done by
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> during the Beeley–<persName
        corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> good offices and pointed out that the recent
       Tunisian-French settlement was along the lines worked out by the good offices mission. With
       regard to Algeria, Senator Fulbright made the suggestion that the French ought to send
       Governor Munoz-Marin to Algeria to convince the Algerians of the advantages of a Puerto Rican
       type of solution to their situation.</p>
      <p>The question was asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had
       been active in the Lebanese situation and the Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> was in constant touch with the Department and was spending his time
       shuttling back and forth between New York and Washington. In response to another question,
       the Secretary indicated that the size of the Lebanese army was between 5, 000 and 6, 000
       men.</p>
      <p>The question of President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s running again was
       raised. The Secretary said that it was out of the question and this was generally understood
       in Lebanon. However, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was reluctant to make any
       formal announcement to this effect as he felt it would completely undercut his influence
       during the remaining period of his term. The question was asked whether there was any
       suitable successor to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and the Secretary replied
       in the negative. He said <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0207"/>there were a number of
       educated and intelligent people in Lebanon who could take over under normal circumstances but
       he did not see any leader who was up to the extraordinary requirements of the present
       situation. The Secretary explained that the Parliament was scheduled to elect a new president
       in July and that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s term ran out in
       September.</p>

        <item>The situation can perhaps best be summed up by the statement of Gallo Plaza that “the
         world is being taken for a ride”.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>In essence, it is a squabble which revolves around <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>, who has not been a clever politician and has prevented people
         accustomed to sharing in the spoils of office from getting their share. This has made
         enemies out of them and is the basis of the opposition. There appears to be no other common
         bond between the members of the opposition—certainly not a desire to throw in their
         fortunes with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has not during this entire period spoken
         to the people or the opposition.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>No definite orders have ever been issued to the Army concerning the rebels. As far as
         the Army is concerned, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> adopts a
         “Gandhi-esque” attitude.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>It took the Lebanese authorities six days to produce for interrogation by the <gloss
          target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group the two so-called Syrian staff officers about whom
          <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> spoke to me almost a week ago. Both of them
         turned out to be minors, both illiterate, and both said the testimony that they gave was
         given under duress. They are not Syrian staff officers.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>The only non-individual weapon which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Observer
         Group has found is one 120 mm. mortar.</item>

        <label>7.</label>
        <item>If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Observer Group were to report today its
         report would explode the whole government case—which the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss> thinks would be a very poor thing to do.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>While there is “the most solid collusion” between the rebels and Syria, no one

        <item><persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> calls the Lebanese crisis a “bad

        <label>10.</label>
        <item>On Monday <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> told him <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had called Prime Minister of Syria and given
         categorical instructions that as of Tuesday morning, June 24, no further supply of men or
         material should be made or permitted to be given to the Lebanese rebels. These instructions
         were given after the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s five hour meeting with <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on Sunday during which the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss> says he “pulled no punches”, used “no anesthetics”, and had “never gone so
         far”. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>
         had never lied to him before. The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said that he had not
         the slightest doubt such orders had been given.</item>
        <label>11.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> was certain that information on these orders had
         gotten straight through to opposition leaders in Lebanon. His reason for this was that they
         had had a very important meeting Monday night which he understood to have been stormy. In
         any case, he said it would seem that information would inevitably soon get through when
         Syrian army received orders in accordance with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName>’s instructions.</item>
        <label>12.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
          >Fawzi</persName> had asked him whether he intended to tell the Lebanese about these
         orders. <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> said he would not, because he
         did not want to be in the middle-man position, and understood why <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would not like publicity which created impression that
          <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, in one visit, had talked <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> into changing his policy. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>
         said this was good, because if there was no amnesty for the rebels, it would be difficult
         for the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to imagine what kind of position he (<persName
          corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>) would be in. The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
         told <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> he did not think it was likely, in light
         of Lebanese psychology, that rebel leaders would be punished.</item>
        <label>13.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> started his conversation with <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> by reviewing the Security Council resolution.<note

          <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s interest that the resolution succeed. He
         told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> he did not think the Russians wanted to
         intervene in the Middle East, but if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> got heavily
         involved, it might, and the whole area would become an area of Western-Soviet conflict. The
          <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> was very much afraid of the Middle East becoming such an area.</item>

        <label>14.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
          >Malik</persName> had told him that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had
         greatly stepped up <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention in Lebanon when Lebanon
         made the complaint to the Arab League and the Security Council. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> told him that all he had done at that time was to lift the ban
         previously placed against Syrian activities. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> told
          <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> he was not interested in whether the <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was committing sins of omission or commission. Either was
         bad. The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> that if he could assume the role of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
         Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he would tell <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> that he had overplayed his hand very badly and that the best thing for
         him to do would be to get out and get out quick. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> made no comment. The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> told <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that he did not want promises from him but wanted him
         to consider the situation and act upon it in light of these conclusions. <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s call to Syria and Fawzi’s report to the <gloss
          target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> followed this meeting.</item>
        <label>15.</label>
        <item>He showed us letter he had just written for transmittal to <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
          >Fawzi</persName>. The letter referred to conversations he had had with <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and information <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
          >Fawzi</persName> had given him about <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
         orders to Syria. The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had also spoken to <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in very blunt terms about Cairo Radio propaganda and
         the letter strongly urged that propaganda be stopped immediately. He did not give us a copy
         of the letter, which he is presumably sending today. The letter also included a statement
         that the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> thought that if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss> carried through with its plans, all foreign intervention would be avoided in
         Lebanon.</item>
        <label>16.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> did not reveal to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> this interview and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
         instructions. He told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> only that he was
         optimistic with “strong sense of responsibility and full integrity” and that he did not
         think any further <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> steps needed to be taken at this time.
         Contrary to newspaper reports, the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had not given him any request for <gloss

        <item>In his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> after returning
         from Cairo, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> asked whether authority of the
         observers could be strengthened without a new <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decision.
         The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> replied that it would not because to strengthen
          <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position would require it to be able to use force. The
          <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> thought effects of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> calling on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to assume this authority
         would be very bad internally and <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> agreed.
          <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decisions to
         give <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers authority to use force required a decision
         that aggression had been committed, which he was doubtful could be sustained. He also said
         he did not feel the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> could delegate its authority under
         Chapter 7<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Chapter 7 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>

        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> asked whether the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
          >UN</gloss> could put a <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> on the border. The <gloss
          target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he could not really judge this question because the big
         powers would have to make up their minds in light of their own interests. However, he
         questioned whether there was need for such action, pointing out again that it would mean
         use of force under Chapter 7. In order to carry out such an operation effectively one to
         two divisions of troops would be required or the operation would not be worthwhile. It
         would only be possible to get that many troops from the big powers, which in itself raised
         many political questions. He also pointed out that the number of troops would be two to
         three times the size of the Lebanese Government forces, with obvious political overtones.
         Such force would be bound to run into clashes with unorganized elements of Syrian frontier.
         He thought this would be opposed by communist agents who he was sure were in Syria and that
         it might ultimately end in “communist volunteers” arriving.</item>
        <label>19.</label>
        <item>He told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> he thought <persName

          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had commented that he could, of course, ask
         for help under Article 51 of the Charter.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">Article 51 of the

         he could, but pointed out that this also had major political repercussions, and that it
         would exclude progress which he had reason to expect. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> then said he was not asking <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> for
         anything at the moment. Gora (?), an assistant to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>, said at the airfield that “if there is no more infiltration we are
         out of it.”</item>

        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> told <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> that if he wanted to wreck everything he felt he had accomplished,
         best way to do this would be to have newspapers start speculating that <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was backing down as a result of the <gloss
          target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s visit to Cairo. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>
         had mentioned this problem to him before he left. Just before <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss>’s departure Wednesday, Lebanese Government official had come to him and asked
         him whether he did not think that they had handled the press situation well. This was
         obviously a reference to the fact that the press was continuing to treat <gloss

        <label>21.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said that his plan for settlement of the Lebanese

        <item>He hoped that the situation could be played out for another week while we watch the

        <label>23.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> referred to the opinion of Plaza that
          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> apparently hoped to use the trump of Western
         intervention to maintain himself as President for another term. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss> said he hoped, in view of the results he looks for from his talk to <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, if such request for external assistance came, that we
         would give <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> a conditional answer which would
         not result in immediate intervention. The answer could point out that <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had not made a public statement of his intention not
         to run, that Army was not vigorously defending the government, that he had not even ordered
         the Army to do so, etc.</item>
        <label>24.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> regarded the present political situation in
         Lebanon as an absolute stalemate. He said the Army could not be trusted to support the
         government. The rebels were not united in action or ideas except in opposition to <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Both the government and the opposition had about
         equal strength. Everyone was thinking about what the situation would be tomorrow and were
         therefore sitting back. No one wanted to do anything irrevocable. The opposition and the
         government were also keeping in touch with each other through many subtle ways. If foreign
         influences could be eliminated—if the Lebanese were alone “in one goldfish bowl”—he thought
         there was a very good chance that a satisfactory political compromise could be
         achieved.</item>
        <label>25.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said the main mood of the rebels was
          anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, whom he described as a very inept
         politician. While it probably included some strong Arab nationalist elements, the mood was
         not anti-Western. He could not say the revolt had been “staged” by <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss>. Probably both sides were taking a stronger position than they would
         otherwise because of expectations of outside backing. Neither had revolt been
         “spontaneous”. It was brought about by cliques of important Lebanese leaders whom <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had removed from office. Cliques had gone to “street”
         while <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was in Moscow. Probably there had been
         Syrian participation at the outset, but he did not seem to think <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had actively condoned intervention until Lebanon had
         complained to the Arab League and the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</item>
        <label>26.</label>
        <item>He thought Druzes were getting some supplies from within Syria by mules over old
         hashish routes. In north of Lebanon there is also some movement back and forth across
         borders. He also thought some <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0212"/>supplies were coming
         directly from Damascus. As far as Cairo was concerned he thought it was more situation of
         letting a situation go on than starting it.</item>
        <label>27.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers had received practically no concrete
         evidence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> involvement. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> proudly told <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> that Lebanese Army
         had destroyed two 81 mm mortars with its first salvo in position near Baalbek. <gloss
          target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> asked whether this had been reported to <gloss
          target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers and commented that two days later (now) Lebanon still
         had made no report on it.</item>
        <label>28.</label>
        <item>On his general attitude toward situation, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said
         that although he was used to Arab world, he would have to say that he was “shocked”. <gloss
          target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> pointed out extraordinary approach of <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He told others he would not run for President again
         but had not told this to Lebanese people. He had not tried to reach opposition leaders to
         arrange settlement. Opposition leaders were given safe conduct passes through army lines,
         and were allowed to contact each other by telephone. The Government had not even shut off
         electricity to rebel centers in Beirut. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has
         not made any direct appeal or speech to Lebanese people and he had not taken firm hand
         within the government. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had impression <persName>Samei
          el-Solh</persName> was fully loyal to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He
         also was staying on as Prime Minister in order to prevent situation from becoming
         Christian–Moslem conflict. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said all three of the <gloss
          target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Observer Groups and Labouisse concurred in his analysis of the
         situation.</item>
        <label>29.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he was not going to tell this story fully to
         others (presumably he meant primarily <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and that he does
         not intend to tell them full story of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
         orders or possibly also his completely frank estimate of the situation. He was very anxious
         that information about his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
         not be revealed).</item>
        <label>30.</label>
        <item><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> recommends earnestly that we give a chance for the
         progress he had made with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to produce results.</item>
        <label>31.</label>
        <item>At the conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s statement I said that I
         was astounded at his picture of the situation, which conflicted in so many ways with what
         we understood to be the case. For example, I said that I was preparing a speech of several
         hours’ duration consisting of what we believe to be hard facts showing massive infiltration
         and attempts by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to take over the
         state.</item>
        <label>32.</label>
        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s answer was that none of these facts which I
         had were being given to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group and that all that
         Loutfi, the Egyptian representative, would have to do would be to ask why these facts had
         not been made available to the group.</item>

      <p>In his June 26 briefing of the National Security Council on significant world developments
       affecting U.S. security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered the
       following assessment of developments in Lebanon: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Turning to the situation in Lebanon, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
          Dulles</persName> said there had been no significant change overnight. However, the truce,
         which had been observed during the visit of the Secretary General of the United Nations,
         was now over. From Hammarskjöld himself we have learned that he is opposed to the
         intervention of foreign troops in Lebanon, whether <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
         or other forces. He believes that a force adequate to police the border could not be formed
         from the armies of the smaller countries, and he does not wish to risk the prestige of the
          <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by a failure to provide an adequate force. While he
         thinks that there has been a considerable infiltration of Syrians into Lebanon, he is also
         convinced that the hostilities in Lebanon are largely internal. He seems to be impressed
         with the views of President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile, there had been a good many reports that rebel forces in and around Beirut are
         soon going to make a large-scale attack on the city. There is continued clear evidence of
          <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> financial and other support to the rebel forces.
         Meanwhile also, there are clear indications that General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> is continuing his equivocal policy. Accordingly, the situation drags on
         without any dramatics, although the tempo of military operations will soon be stepped up.”

      <p>Lord Hood said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Dixon</persName> had seen Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> last night and had been filled in on his Middle
       East mission. He assumed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> had also
       informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. It seemed clear that what
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> envisaged was a short <pb n="182"
        xml:id="pg_182" facs="0214"/>respite in order to provide time for political solutions in
       Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> now felt that the United
       States, the United Kingdom and France should urge such a solution.</p>
      <p>Although we had been reluctant in the past to inform <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> that he should step down, it now seemed necessary to advise him on the
       political future. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had stated privately that he
       would not expect to seek reelection, but there still was widespread doubt as to his
       intentions in this regard. Until these doubts were resolved, it appeared unlikely that
       progress could be made in selecting and obtaining support for his successor. If the present
       situation should continue, there was a grave danger that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> himself might be thrown out by the rebels, leading to chaos in Lebanon
       with the likelihood of an ultimate takeover by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. On
       the other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should declare his intention
       not to seek reelection, it might be possible to rally moderate elements in support of a
       satisfactory alternate.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>, therefore,
       proposed that the three Ambassadors should make a formal demarche advising <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to make a public statement on the election. They would
       say that we envisaged his role to use his influence in the background rather than in the
       office of President itself. The first step should be for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> and ourselves to agree upon a successor whom we would all support.</p>
      <p>In addition to this political move, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn
        Lloyd</persName> thought that we should support to the maximum <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> action in the Lebanon for the purpose of reducing the rebels’ effectiveness
       while working to strengthen the Government.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> planned to be in
       Paris on Sunday and would like to discuss this approach with the French if the Secretary
       agreed.</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented upon the order in which the various matters might best be
       considered with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He thought it important that a
       decision be made as to the best candidate in lieu of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>, before <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is asked to make a
       public statement that he would not stand for reelection. The discussion of the successor
       could be based on <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s statement to us that he
       would not seek reelection. The Secretary instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> to draft a possible communication which would provide the basis for
       instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>. This draft
       should then be discussed with the British. He said that until we had had further discussions
       between the U.S. and the U.K., it was difficult to comment upon the wisdom of taking the
       matter up with the French at this juncture. We should have a better idea on this before Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>’s proposed visit to Paris.</p>

      <p>In conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> you should refer to fact
       that he has on several occasions stated clearly to us that he does not plan to seek
       reelection. You should state that in these circumstances it seems to us most desirable that
       his great influence in Lebanon be used to insure the greatest possibilities for the election
       of a person in whom he has confidence and who shares his determination to defend independence
       and integrity of Lebanon. Accordingly and in view of our desire to be helpful to Lebanon in

      <p>Reading from notes, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> conveyed
       to the Secretary the substance of a telephone conversation <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> had had with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning.
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> said the following.</p>
      <p>Illegal infiltrations were going on undiminished; they were taking place at night, and
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers were not able to confirm infiltrations because
       they did not operate at night and because they do not reach points on the frontier where the
       infiltrators go. The observers spend their time in social clubs at night and some of them
       spend their days at the seaside. The situation in Tripoli is very serious and the insurgents
       used bazookas and mortars. The amount of fire was so great that it suggests that the
       insurgents may have considerably more ammunition than the governmental forces. Syrian
       officers are commanding movements of the insurgents in the <persName>Shouf</persName> area,
       and the situation in Beirut is somewhat serious. The army is working hard and doing its best.
       He did not know what the Secretary General’s optimism was based on. If <persName
        corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName>’s optimism is based on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s promise, the Americans know how much <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s and Syria’s promises are worth. Will they keep such promises? Is it
       conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has given up the idea of
       destroying Lebanese independence? <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> has not
       been given a promise not to destroy the pro-Western orientation of <pb n="186"
        xml:id="pg_186" facs="0218"/>Lebanon, and even if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> has given such a promise, the facts are to the contrary since
       infiltrations and the radio and press campaign continue undiminished. It is not a question of
        <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> or the observers since there are inherent
       limitations in both. It is the question of the clear pledge of the US. What has brought the
       present fury of Sovietism and Nasserism to Lebanon? It was Lebanon’s adherence to the
       Eisenhower Doctrine which has brought about Lebanon’s present difficulties. Two questions
       evolve from these difficulties. First, will the US come to the assistance of Lebanon within
       or without the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? Second, will US aid be directed against
       aggression, direct or indirect? He had heard conflicting statements by the US. (At this point
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he responded to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> that neither President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
       nor Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> has made any statements which
       indicated a change of US policy.) We certainly will and must exhaust every possibility before
       asking for direct aid. This matter affects Lebanon, her children and her children’s children.
       Lebanon does not approach this question in a frivolous way or light-heartedly. We will pick
       the right moment for intervention. A number of countries in the area know the importance of
       the battle. If Lebanese independence is compromised, other friendly countries in the area
       will go. Lebanon is holding the dike and this is a battle not for Lebanon alone but it is a
       battle of the West. If Lebanon goes, the West will go down too. All members of the Cabinet
       and the Prime Minister agree with the above.</p>
      <p>After reporting the foregoing as <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s words,
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> turned to a special message which he said he had
       received from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> a few days ago. He reported that
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is not prepared to accept any compromise.
       There were three reasons: First, that as a matter of principle <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> should not have any voice in the external or internal affairs of Lebanon;
       second, that any compromise would be detrimental to Lebanon’s foreign policy, would weaken
       the legal authority, and help the insurgents; and third, that he is opposed to any
       negotiations with the opposition group as long as there are Egyptians and Syrians on Lebanese
       soil. Any stopping of the fighting would help the rebels. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> recognized the limitations of the observers. While <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> agreed that the army could do better, it was
       nevertheless not idle. They have killed two thousand which is equivalent to four hundred
       thousand killed in the US. It must not be forgotten that 40 percent of the army is Moslem and
       therefore the army must be handled carefully. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       will fight this battle until he wins or collapses because this is a battle for freedom and
       for stability and peace in the Middle East. It transcends Lebanese interests.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> then said he would now like to make a statement
       of his own. He thought Lebanon was involved in a struggle concerning whose outcome the US
       cannot be indifferent. It was not an internal problem alone; it far transcended Lebanon. He
       said that “<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0219"/>may be this or that, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> may be this or that, <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> may be
       this or that, various politicians in Lebanon may be this or that, internal problems in
       Lebanon may be this or that; but allowing that there is something rotten in the kingdom of
       Denmark, must we allow the kingdom of Denmark to go to pieces?”</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> then raised two questions: “First, is the total
       international situation at present such that it cannot be helped that friendship with the
       West, and in particular with the US, puts governments and individuals in the Middle East at a
       decided disadvantage? Secondly, is the international situation such that it cannot be helped
       that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and the communists must score yet another
       advance in the Middle East?" <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said individuals
       were unimportant except insofar as they are called upon to play an important role.
       Individuals were fully expendable. “If there is any hitch as to individuals as obstacles to
       the useful course of history, such a situation should be discussed frankly.”</p>
      <p>The Secretary said he was starting from the premise that we are agreed that every practical
       measure should be taken to prevent a victory for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> and communism and that we should act in such a way as to make it clear
       that friendship with the West is an asset and not a liability. The Secretary said the
       practical question is what we do in present circumstances. The Secretary recalled that we had
       done quite a bit, including military equipment, strong support of Lebanon in the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and our assistance in bringing about the adoption of a
       resolution in the Security Council.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then said that on one important point our information did not agree with that
       of the Lebanese. Our intelligence sources indicated that there has been a considerable
       reduction or termination of infiltrations across the border. We have good independent
       intelligence sources and much concrete evidence regarding operations in Lebanon. The
       activities of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
        >Hammarskjold</persName> have brought about a large cessation of infiltration. The Secretary
       did not know how long it would last for the rebels may already have received great quantities
       of assistance. But we could not honestly say today on the basis of our own intelligence that
       the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation had failed.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then turned to the practical question of what to do. He said we both agreed
       that sending Western troops is disastrous. While military intervention by the US might be the
       lesser of two evils, it would touch off anti-Westernism and rally a bigger percentage of the
       Lebanese people against the Lebanese Government. Moreover, it might jeopardize other friendly
       governments such as Iraq and Jordan. The governments of the West would not be united because
       some are strongly opposed to intervention. Moreover, most <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       members would oppose such intervention in view of <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
        >Hammarskjold</persName>’s belief that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss><pb n="188"
        xml:id="pg_188" facs="0220"/>operations are having a desirable effect. The Secretary
       emphasized that on the basis of our information we could not dispute Secretary General
        <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName>’s view in this regard.</p>
      <p>The Secretary continued that we therefore come back to the proposition that the Lebanese
       matter should be resolved without the use of troops from the outside, particularly forces
       from the big powers. We are not deterred by nor do we fear the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss>. Our military experts feel that we are stronger vis-à-vis the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> today than we may be in the future since the Soviets for the
       purposes of economy have skipped the long-range bomber stage and have gone directly into
       missiles development.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said there is concern about the innumerable difficulties and issues which
       intervention would precipitate. The Secretary recalled how the US opposed the intervention of
       the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France and Israel in 1956. While the Lebanese
       situation is no parallel, the man in the street sees no real difference and intervention
       would undoubtedly be misrepresented in the Middle East. It is easy to get into Lebanon but it
       is hard to get out without promoting strong anti-Western feeling and anti-Americanism. A
       government sustained by bayonets is not a good situation. While intervention may be a lesser
       of two great evils, the Secretary thought we must use all our resources and imagination to
       avoid it. The Secretary also made it clear that he considered the greater evil to be that the
       appeal of a small country go unheeded and Lebanon thereby lose its independence.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then referred to <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s comments
       regarding individuals and their expendability. The Secretary said that Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> had been instructed to raise with <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> the question of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s purposes and plans. The Secretary asked: If <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> decides not to run, as he had indicated to us previously, who is going
       to take over? What is the political future in Lebanon? The Secretary said it ought to be
       possible to find an individual oriented to the West. Surely, if there were only one or two
       individuals oriented to the West, the situation was very bad. The Secretary said we need to
       think together on how to prepare the situation if <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> is not running. Economic support would be important to Lebanon and
       helpful to the individual who is to succeed <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.
       The election could be only about four weeks hence and therefore careful plans have to be
       made. The US was not trying to play politics in Lebanon or prescribe what should be done in
       the situation, but this was a problem which had to be explored. At this point the Secretary
       elaborated on the French attitude indicating their insistence on participation if the US and
       the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervene. The Secretary said this would bring all of
       the problems of North Africa to the Lebanese situation and make it more difficult.</p>
      <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0221"/>
      <p>The Secretary said that the use of naked force represented in a sense a failure of
       statesmanship. On the other hand, there has to be a willingness to use force in the last
       resort, otherwise diplomacy will not be able to do its job. If hostile forces believe that
       you are afraid to use force, they will pressure you into making concessions. It was necessary
       to be willing to fight.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said he did not exclude the possibility that the evidence of cessation of
       outside assistance may lead to diminishing efforts on the part of the rebels. Perhaps the
       rebels have already been so considerably supplied that diminished efforts on their part will
       not follow. Nevertheless, it was important that preparations be made for handling the
       political situation in Lebanon. If <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> were to run
       again there would be considerable disadvantage since it would look as if the US policy was
       directed to supporting one individual. It would be a great sign of weakness if there were
       only one person who could carry forward the pro-Western orientation of Lebanon. Plans should
       be made to select someone in whom <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has
       confidence; this man should not represent a compromise with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. The Secretary said he opposed a deal with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>, and he did not favor the election of someone who could be expected to
       adopt a policy of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> pan-Arabism. The Secretary
       said it was essential that someone be selected who is acceptable to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> and who
       reflects the Lebanese spirit of independence.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> agreed on the necessity of going ahead and
       making plans for a political change. He said that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> has been so harassed that he has not had time to think about these
       matters. Moreover, in the mechanism of the transfer of power it should be possible to arrange
       the transfer in such a manner that it will not reduce the power to be transferred. It would
       be particularly important that the authority and political power of the Government not be
       diminished in relationship to the rebels.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that we were concerned with this latter point. He said that we could be
       of help to a prospective successor, particularly with respect to certain measures of economic
       support. A period of weakness might therefore be avoided. The Secretary once again emphasized
       that plans must be carefully prepared. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that
       if this issue can be cleared up, a move could be made to the next stage. He said that what
       the Secretary seemed to be saying was a condition precedent to the next stage. The Secretary
       said that the question of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s political successor
       had become a more pressing issue since the elections were only four weeks away. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> added that this would be particularly the case if
       there should be a lessening of pressure from the insurgents against the Government.</p>

      <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjold</persName> was convinced
       that a good start had been made in accomplishing his mission. He may be right or he may be
       wrong. Nevertheless, as long as Hammarskjold is convinced of this fact, it would be extremely
       difficult to get further <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. The Secretary said there
       would not seem to be any advantage in pressing now for further <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> action. Moreover, he did not believe it would be possible to get seven votes in
       the Security Council as long as Hammarskjold is satisfied that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> effort has not failed.</p>
      <p>The conversation closed with <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> referring to his
       own personal plans. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> felt that there was no longer
       any necessity for him to stay on since he did not expect any Security Council action in the
       near future. Nevertheless, he said he might be useful if <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> indicated to him his thoughts regarding the political issue, and he
       could then be of some service here in discussing the issue with the Secretary. The Secretary
       concluded by emphasizing once again the importance of making plans so that a prospective
       successor could be assured of appropriate assistance, resources, and support.</p>

       <item>Interview opened with an account by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> of
        present military situation. He was pleased at yesterday’s action in the Chouf in which
        Jumblat’s Druzes had suffered losses and had been repelled from vicinity of Chemlan. Army
        and Air Force with gendarmérie were continuing offensive operations against Jumblat today.
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName><pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0223"/>dwelt
        at length on strategic importance of the Chouf where he said all Lebanon’s decisive battles
        for past 400 years had been fought. He pointed out control of Chouf permitted domination of
        access to Beirut, to the Bekaa from the coast and coastal communications with
         <persName>Sadon</persName>. Beirut was quiet although Basta might erupt at any time.
        Fighting in Tripoli had been very severe with estimated casualties on rebel side between two
        and three hundred in each of the two preceding nights. Insurgent military command in Tripoli
        was now in Syrian hands, said <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, there having
        been violent differences between Rashid Karame and the Baathist leader Rafi which had been
        compromised by giving military direction to a Syrian officer. However, Army was reacting
        energetically in Tripoli and its defensive lines seemed well held. (This point is
        corroborated by ARMA.) Intelligence indicated rebels were bringing in 120 millimeter mortars
        at Minia north of Tripoli for attack tonight against army lines. Situation around Baalbek
        and the Bekaa generally was quiet. In response to our question President said he thought
        military balance was leaning lightly in favor of government.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Ambassadors then pointed out that despite this light balance in government’s favor, it
        looked like a long drawn-out insurrection unless there could be some sort of political
        solution. By previous arrangement French Ambassador made his representation first. It
        included reference to advisability of a statement by <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> to his own people of intent not seek re-election; and of need for
        consideration of forming a government with as wide a possible base of national union to
        facilitate an eventual compromise. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> listened to
        this representation with obvious distaste.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>I followed, limiting my intervention to terms of paragraph 2, <gloss
         target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5080 which I presented orally. This was the only element
        of tripartite representation made in English as French was language of our
        conversation.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Middleton then associated himself with French démarche indicating with my complete
        agreement that all three Ambassadors had a friendly concern as to how political future of
        Lebanon would shape up, pointing out need to look beyond fixed dates such as July 24 and
        September 23.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item><p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> made his reply in mounting choler. He
         said “if I am in the situation you find me in today, it is precisely because I have been a
         friend of the west. If I had wished an easy life or to be reelected for a second term by a
         unanimous vote, all I had to do was follow a policy of positive neutrality. Instead of that
         in 1956 I refused to break relations with you—England and France—and this was the start of
         my troubles. It is because of my pro-western policy that you find me fighting today.”</p>
        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0224"/>
        <p>He said he had noticed many signs which seemed to indicate our three governments were
         having second thoughts on guarantees given for Lebanon’s integrity and independence. He did
         not at all relish political advice he was now being given. With flushed face and rising
         inflection he said all he wished to know was where he stood in respect to guarantees given
         by three western powers. He would await a response from our respective
        governments.</p></item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>I said so far as US was concerned I could give him a straight answer now. I said our
        readiness to intervene to assist Lebanon to maintain its integrity and independence has not
        changed but remained as defined to him in my interviews of May 14, May 24, June 16 (when I
        left a letter) and my oral presentation of a message from the Secretary of State on June 20
         (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4890).<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4"><ref
          target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> Matter we had come to discuss was not
        reaffirmation of guarantees but in all sincerity and friendship to inquire his views on
        political succession in Lebanon since he himself had told us all he had no intention of
        seeking a second term. Since Parliament had been convoked for July 24th to elect a new
        President, it seemed reasonable that Lebanon’s friends should ascertain from Lebanon’s
        President what he thought about these new elections.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had meanwhile been fighting to get a grip
        on his temper and began to calm down. He did somewhat resentfully mutter that he could not
        be charged with thinking up a presidential slate while at same time fighting for his life.
        Eventually however, and in a much calmer mood he ticked off the fairly unresplendent list of
        candidates both in and out of Parliament, concluding, “as you see it is no easy task to find
        a man who can govern Lebanon and carry out my policies.” However he said he would give
        problem further reflection although he did not rise to my remark that possibly we could meet
        again to discuss candidate. When he asked us if we had any names in mind, we said we had
        come to him to find his views, not to advance our own.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>Several times during conversation which lasted an hour and a half <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he could if he wished be re-elected again since he
        had a “crushing majority” of Christian population behind him. He said “if I wished to, by
        choosing my own time and in my own way, I could be president of this country again.”
        Although throughout interview he accepted proposition that issue of non-renewal had been
        decided, he was clearly furious at suggestion he make a public statement to Lebanese people
        to this effect. I had overall impression that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
        could easily persuade himself, given a slight upturn in his military fortunes, that he is
        the indispensable man who must remain in office to carry out his policies and vindicate his
        position.</item>
       <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0225"/>
       <label>9.</label>
       <item>President said several times during conversation he had no belief efforts of
        Hammarskjold would be successful in preventing infiltration against Lebanon. He denied local
        press reports <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had been instructed to request
        another session of Security Council.</item>
       <label>10.</label>
       <item>Interview closed on a note of strained cordiality. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> said we should mark well fact that Lebanon commanded position of Jordan
        and Iraq. If forces of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should triumph here, he
        predicted masses of population in AU would give their governments short shrift.</item>
       <label>11.</label>
       <item>As we left <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> inquired if our three
        governments still intended to give him aid in form of weapons and matériel. We said yes.
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> reaffirmed once more that he would not ask
        for our military intervention “unless the knife is at my throat.” When I pointed to a
        combination clock–barometer–compass on his desk and expressed hope the weather would be
        better he laughed and said “ I still have not lost my compass.”<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5"
          ><p>This telegram was discussed at the Secretary of State’s Staff Meeting on July 2.
           <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> indicated dissatisfaction that the result
          of British-French coordination had been an approach to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> based upon a position which the United Kingdom favored but the United
          States did not. He said that <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> had gone
          along with the British and French Ambassadors in making this approach, and the result was
          that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had reacted violently and the situation
          had become even more delicate. He felt that it would be necessary to call Lord Hood in to
          express U.S. displeasure. (Department of State, Secretary’s Staff Meetings: Lot 63 D
          75)</p>
         <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> saw <persName corresp="#p_HVS1"
           >Hood</persName> later in the day and raised the issue. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
           >Dulles</persName> said that rather than urging President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> to make a categoric statement immediately as to his intention not to
          run again for office, it seemed to him more important to have <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> concentrate first on getting a suitable successor. Hood agreed, but
          said that the French felt that this might eventually lead to the necessity of supporting
          whomever <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> chose. (<hi rend="italic"

      </list>
      <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he was inspired by the
       statement made by the Secretary to him in their last conversation that intervention spelled
       bankruptcy of diplomacy. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he agreed with this
       statement and for the record he wished to say that he never contemplated the possibility of
       armed intervention lightly, but certainly as a last resort and not without explicit support
       of Arab friends and, if possible, with their active participation. He, therefore, had
       considered what measures could be taken short of a last resort. He said that the measures he
       was suggesting have not been fully tried and if fully tried had an excellent chance of
       resolving the Lebanese crisis without having to proceed to the last resort and without either
       giving Nasserism or communism a victory or causing further retreat of the West in the Middle
       East.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that his suggested
       measures were based on four fundamental assumptions: (a) that it is the United States policy
       that Lebanon’s independence be maintained; (b) that it is United States policy that Nasserism
       and communism should not be allowed to score a victory; (c) that assumptions (a) and (b)
       above should be conceived as independent, if possible, of persons or regimes in Lebanon; (d)
       that the rebellion in Lebanon to overthrow the Government would continue with active and
       decisive assistance coming to it from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> left with the Department an informal note
       containing the following 18 suggestions: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Strong and repeated declarations of support of Lebanon by leaders of the West.</item>

        <item>Arming of paramilitary groups (partisans) in Lebanon to support the regular
         Army.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>Military and other technical advisers from the West, similar to the case of
         Greece.</item>
        <label>9.</label>
        <item>Promote a less strict interpretation of the Security Council resolution by sending
         more observers and, if necessary, troops to aid them as the Secretary General had at first
         planned.</item>
        <label>10.</label>
        <item>Bring the matter again to the Security Council with very strong speeches in support of
         Lebanon and with a strong resolution that will almost certainly be vetoed.</item>
        <label>11.</label>
        <item>Transfer matter to the General Assembly and have strong speeches made there with a
         resolution seeking diplomatic and economic sanctions only.</item>
        <label>12.</label>
        <item>Much more attention paid to the press of Lebanon.</item>
        <label>13.</label>
        <item>As many governments of the Middle East as possible to come out boldly and publicly in
         support of Lebanon.</item>
        <label>14.</label>
        <item>Have a firm understanding, and if necessary a showdown, with <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</item>
        <label>15.</label>
        <item>Try to win as many people of the Opposition in Lebanon as possible by political and
         all sorts of other means.</item>
        <label>16.</label>
        <item>Prudent Iraqi and Turkish troop movements to give <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> cause for worry.</item>
        <label>17.</label>

        <label>18.</label>
        <item>Exploit internal situation in Syria.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Secretary agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s approach and
       recalled his view that when governments turned over problems to fighting men diplomacy had
       failed. The Secretary said that if we are resourceful, we can find a solution short of
       intervention. The Secretary agreed generally that we and the Lebanese could do more short of
       intervention. He emphasized that the Lebanese had not made as effective a public case as
       desirable. He felt if the Lebanese dramatized the case more, it might create a greater
       deterrent. He expressed his feeling that civil war would dry up if outside assistance could
       be deterred. Without accepting any of the suggestions contained in the informal note left by
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, the Secretary said we would give them careful
       study. He emphasized that the Lebanese should get more support from the Arabs <pb n="196"
        xml:id="pg_196" facs="0228"/>and mentioned Tunisia specifically as a possibility. If a
       chorus could be developed in support of the Lebanese case, it would be helpful in the
       circumstances.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said the above were only suggestions. He
       stressed point 15 above as of particular importance. The Secretary noted omission of the
       question of a political program for Lebanon. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
       said this could be added to the list as No. 19 with the phrasing something along these lines:
       “Greater constructive clarity as to the political future of Lebanon.”</p>
      <p>The Secretary noted <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>’s discussion with
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> regarding the political issue in Lebanon did
       not quite follow the line we had intended since it appeared to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> as an attempt to try to get <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to step down rather than a question of who is to step in. The Secretary
       again noted there were some good ideas in the above list and stressed the importance of being
       concrete on some of these things. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> responded that
       the question of political settlement is a delicate issue and the limits of concessions should
       be drawn in advance. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said there was a field for
       greater precision between the United States and Lebanon on this question in particular even
       though it is internal. He felt it important to be precise as to the limits of concessions.
       The Secretary said there should not be concessions in the sense that someone is selected who
       is not an adherent of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s policy. He was against
       a political deal with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> responded that we cannot think of political changes unless
       there is a healthy atmosphere brought about by a victory over the rebels. With a victory over
       the rebels, the mood of everybody in Lebanon would change and the Lebanese would see that it
       was silly to go on with the fighting. He stressed that the rebellion must not be given a
       feeling of success. In response to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s
       query as to how <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> visualizes the progression of
       events assuming victory over the rebels, <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said
       this depended on events. If the rebels were given a serious blow, Parliament could meet; if a
       stalemate continues, it would be difficult for such a meeting to take place.</p>

      <p>95. For <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Barbour</persName>. In discussion British proposal
       extend guidelines Lebanese operation, Dept informed by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on
       July 2 that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> as <gloss
        target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1">CINCSPECOMME</gloss> has reacted negatively to proposed extension.
        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> supports <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName>’s view that US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces available are
       sufficient only for initial landing Beirut and should not be split to effect landing at
       Tripoli or elsewhere. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has informed British military reps
       here of foregoing.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would not object if British insist on conducting
       Tripoli operation themselves but would expect details would be worked out with <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>.</p>
      <p>On June 30 British Minister handed <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>
        paper<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">Not found.</note> outlining current Fonoff thinking re
       general policy US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should follow if military
       intervention becomes necessary. Inter alia this paper specifically included occupation of
       airfield at Rayak in addition to Beirut and Tripoli. Dept queried <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
        >JCS</gloss> about Rayak. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> commented that Rayak is
       obviously strategic location but <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> not aware that it had
       been included in any plans discussed so far. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> opinion is
       that <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>’s objections to extending operations
       include Tripoli would apply with much greater force to attempting initial landing at
       Rayak.</p>
      <p>In discussing foregoing with Fonoff and <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1"
        >CINCSPECOMME</gloss>, Dept desires you ascertain (1) if British interest in Tripoli landing
       such that they plan make additional forces available carry it out and (2) if British thinking
       in regard to Rayak operation is for landing there in early stages or in subsequent
       expansion.</p>
      <p>You should inform Fonoff that Dept is aware that some assumptions underlying present plans
       land only at Beirut may no longer stand and that it might be found necessary extend
       operations in early stages to include landings at Tripoli and perhaps elsewhere. As they
       stand plans recognize that developments after initial landing may require commitment of
       additional forces. If it appears that situation would require expansion of intervention then
       planning must comprehend forces necessary for achieving this.</p>

       <head>SUBJECT</head>
       <item>Anglo-French Approach to President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName></item>
      </list>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> told Lord Hood that we were concerned
       regarding two aspects of the demarche made by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, French
       and US Ambassadors to President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> early this
        week.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> First
       our Ambassador had been associated by his presence with the Anglo-French statements which
       went further than we thought useful at this stage. Second, despite the discussion and
       agreement with the British upon the line to be followed, we find ourselves at cross purposes.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> explained we had thought that an
       Anglo-American position had been worked out and were surprised that Foreign Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s conversations in Paris had resulted in new
       instructions to the British Ambassador with which we did not, and still do not, agree.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood agreed that this was an unfortunate incident. He explained that the Foreign
       Secretary was in Paris and that the Embassy telegram had come too late to affect the
       instructions to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador in Beirut. He enumerated the
       French points which the British had found persuasive in planning their approach to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>
       then commented that we had wanted only to let <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       know discreetly that we had taken him seriously when he had told us he did not seek
       reelection, and that we were interested in learning who he thought should be his successor.
       We did not favor asking <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to make a public
       announcement at this time that he would stand down in September. Due to this slip-up, Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> feared that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> has been greatly demoralized.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood said that <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> was equally as unhappy
       over developments in Lebanon. In the first place, he was disturbed over the lack of concrete
       evidence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> interference in Lebanon. In this connection,
       he hoped that we both would persuade <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to publish
       all the evidence available as to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> involvement in the
       revolution. He added that it is now clear the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers are
       not genuinely sympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and for that
       matter, neither is Hammarskjold. The latter, <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0231"
       />according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>, seems to think that the
       revolution is primarily due to internal dissension which <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> is using as an excuse to bring in outside forces to help him maintain
       power.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood said that <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> is also worried
       because he does not believe that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers are
       sufficient in numbers and that they do not take their job seriously enough. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> proposes that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
       US instruct their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives to talk to Hammarskjold
       and “goad” him into greater activity. Perhaps they could point out that Lebanon constitutes a
       test case to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which has a mandate there and that <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> failure could cause great damage to the organization. We might
       ask Hammarskjold whether he has suggestions as to increasing the number of observers or the
       scope of their activities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> agreed in
       general to this approach and said it was clear that the Secretary General would not wish to
       send a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police force or a substantially larger observer
       group without referring back to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for authority. Lord
       Hood said that the Foreign Secretary was speaking only of observers. Lord Hood said that if
       we will advise our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation along these lines the British
       will send appropriate instructions to Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Pierson
        Dixon</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> assented.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood mentioned a report from a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer in Lebanon
       who said that the insurgents have from 5 to 12 thousand men under arms of whom some 300 to 1,
       000 are Syrians. The observer expressed astonishment that the government forces have not
       taken a village in the Bakaa region to illustrate the fact that the Syrians are in Lebanon in
       significant numbers.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood asked what the American views are as to a successor to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that we would
       have to see how he reacted to the Anglo-French approach and the query of Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> before replying and added that he would let Lord
       Hood know our views after he had talked these matters over in the Department.</p>

        Hammarskjöld was visiting Washington in connection with the release on July 3 of the first

        established the problems for effective observation created by a difficult terrain, and by
        the fact that access to the border by <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> observers was only
        established for the 18 miles of the border controlled by government forces. (<gloss

      <p>The Secretary of State</p>
      <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> showed me the notes<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">Not
        found.</note> of his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, and some subsequent correspondence with
       Fawsi, indicating <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s agreement to stop movements
       across the border into Lebanon and also indicating Hammarskjold’s suggestion that observation
       be carried out from the Syrian side.</p>
      <p>While I was reading these papers, I handed to the Secretary General the “List of Reports
       received by the US Government bearing on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Intervention in
       Lebanon, May–June 1958”.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">Apparent reference to a document
        prepared in <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> on June 20 entitled “Evidences of <gloss
         target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Intervention in Lebanon.” A copy of this 16-page document was
        sent to <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_CHSJ1">Hugh S.
         Cumming, Jr.</persName>, on June 20 under cover of a memorandum from <persName>Richard H.
         Sanger</persName> of <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IRA/<gloss target="#t_DRN1"
         >DRN</gloss>. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/6–2058; included in the
        microfiche supplement)</note> I said that in addition to this report we had from sources in
       Cairo good reason to believe that, following the Secretary General’s visit to Cairo,
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had in fact sought to stop the movement of men
       and materiel from Syria into Lebanon, although he had apparently desired that the fighting
       within Lebanon continue. In connection with the paper which I had given to Mr.
        <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>, I remarked that I suspected that our own intelligence was
       far more complete and dependable than that of the Lebanon Government itself. I said that I
       had been dismayed at the Baghdad Pact meeting in Ankara at the time of the Syrian crisis and
       Egyptian take-over under guise of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> that the
       intelligence available to the governments of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan was either lacking or
       extremely undependable, and that the most dependable information had been obtained from
       Washington rather than from these neighboring states.</p>
      <p>I expressed my appreciation to the Secretary General for what he was doing and said I felt
       that his intervention with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had been useful,
       although of course, as the Secretary General agreed, it did not overcome the past
       intervention, the consequences of which were still apparent. (The notes of the Secretary
       General’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> indicated <pb n="201"
        xml:id="pg_201" facs="0233"/>that the Secretary General had very strongly asserted as an
       undeniable fact <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention by men and matériel and by
       provocative and inflammatory radio.)</p>
      <p>I said that the United States recognized that armed intervention from the West would be a
       very undesirable outcome. It would undoubtedly give rise to an intensified wave of
       anti-Western feeling on which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could capitalize.
       It would weaken the position of independent governments in the Arab area and also would
       create in Lebanon an unfortunate situation because a government which could only survive on
       the basis of foreign bayonets was not likely to survive very long after the bayonets were
       withdrawn. However, we had to take into account the fact that if Lebanon, which had been the
       most independent and pro-Western of the Arab States, appealed for help and was refused, the
       impact of that also would be great, not only in the neighboring Arab area but also in
       peripheral states such as Libya, Sudan, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. I said that the latter three
       States were strongly insistent upon a United States military intervention and that if
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his Soviet backers were to gain a victory
       in Lebanon while we stood aside and looked in the other direction, the countries neighboring
       on the Soviet Union and on Egypt would be so shaken that the effect could be very bad.
       Indeed, it was quite possible that to obviate this Turkey and Iraq would precipitate fighting
       by their own action on the theory that it would compel the United States to come in.</p>
      <p>Obviously, both to intervene and not to intervene under these circumstances would be very
       bad. Therefore the objective must be to find a third solution which would involve preserving
       the independence of Lebanon, while at the same time avoiding any victory for <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> through a political compromise of <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> with the rebel elements. The Secretary General said he
       fully recognized that there should be no such compromise and that as his notes confirmed he
       had made clear to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that there could be no such
       compromise.</p>
      <p>The Secretary General then began to outline an idea he had for bringing Lebanon
       semi-permanently and especially under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> protection by the
       establishment on an indefinite basis of a small group of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       observers at Beirut who would be there to note and to report on any intrusion from without on
       the independence and integrity of Lebanon, whether these intrusions were in the form of
       physical intrusions or radio provocation.</p>
      <p>We then adjourned from the luncheon room to the Secretary’s office, Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> left and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> joined us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> will

        <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>, at which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
        >Lodge</persName> was present. When the Secretary and Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>
       adjourned to the Secretary’s office, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>
       joined them.</p>
      <p>The Secretary repeated for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>’s benefit
       the Secretary General’s suggestion of a semi-permanent <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
       group of observers in the Lebanon which would note and report on any intrusion from without
       on the independence and integrity of Lebanon. In reply to the Secretary’s request for his
       comments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> expressed the view that this
       was an interesting idea that might be given careful thought. However, it would appear
       practicable only after the present crisis had been overcome since the plan assumed the
       reduction in the number of <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> observers whereas the present
       tendency, particularly among the Lebanese, was to believe that the group should be
       considerably expanded. If there were a satisfactory political solution to the problem and
       order were restored, it was possible that the Lebanese Government would see in the proposal
       an opportunity to enhance Lebanese security. On the other hand, it was possible that the
       Lebanese Government in power at the time would consider acceptance of the proposal an
       enfringement upon Lebanese sovereignty. Although the matter was discussed further, no
       conclusion was reached. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> whether he
       had discussed this matter with others, and Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> replied that
       he had mentioned it only to <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Ralph Bunche</persName>. He thought
       that if it should later be decided to proceed with the plan, it was important that it come
       either from himself or a representative of one of the smaller and relatively disinterested
       countries, such as Mr. <persName>Engen</persName> of Norway.</p>
      <p>In discussing the situation generally, Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> expressed the
       view that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had been reluctant to become involved
       in the Lebanese affair and had done so only at the insistence of the Syrians, who had taken
       the lead in any assistance which had been given to the Lebanese rebels. He expressed the view
       that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was in the position of feeling compelled
       to move aggressively either on the external political front or with large scale economic
       development. He thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> preferred the latter,
       and hoped that in the future he would pursue that course. The Secretary and Mr.
        <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> discussed in general terms the problems of Egyptian-Syrian
       relations.</p>

      <p>104. We have noted your recent reports indicating <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> now actively considering problem of successor to him. We believe this
       process should be encouraged and request that you convey following to President:</p>
      <p>You should refer to your statement on July 1<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">See <ref
         target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> concerning our desire to be helpful to Lebanon in
       matter of forthcoming election of new President in whom <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> has confidence and who shares his determination to defend independence
       and integrity of Lebanon. Since date of that conversation we have received increasing
       indications of expectation in Lebanon that Parliament will convene on July 24 or shortly
       thereafter for purpose of considering election of new president. Our estimate is that failure
       of Parliament to be convoked at that time for this purpose would have negative effect not
       only upon opposition but upon some elements loyal to government. Accordingly, and because of
       our desire to be of appropriate assistance, we are increasingly anxious to know from
       President what his political program for future is.</p>
      <p>We do not want to see any political compromise or “deal” with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. On the contrary, we believe there surely must be within Lebanon
       qualified presidential candidates dedicated to preserving genuine independence of Lebanon. We
       confident <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> appreciates great measure of faith we
       have shown him by grave and indeed momentous responsibility assumed by Western powers on
       behalf of independence and integrity of nation which he heads.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">In
        telegram 113 to Beirut, July 8, the Department indicated that it did not believe <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> expected a further reply from the United States to his
        inquiry during the tripartite démarche of July 1 concerning the willingness of the Western
        governments to stand by the pledges they had given Lebanon. The British Chargé raised the
        question of a reply on July 8, and <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> replied
        that the Department felt Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> had
        responded adequately to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s inquiry at the time,
        and no further response was required. Hood concurred. (Department of State, Central Files,
        783A.00/7–858; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> We believe this attitude on our
       part entitles us expect from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> a frank and
       confidential indication of what his own program is. He should not expect us to <pb n="204"

       desire be helpful in assuring election of successor to him of person dedicated like him to
       genuine independence of Lebanon.</p>

         ><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported, in telegram 256 from Beirut,
        July 10, that Colonel Zouein, Commandant of the Gendarmérie, told him that <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> intended to use the possibility of intervention by Iraq
        and Turkey “as his last cartridge.” <persName>Zouein</persName> characterized <persName

        concluded that he would not be surprised if <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
        asked for military support from the Moslem powers of the Baghdad Pact. (<hi rend="italic"

        244.<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">In telegram 244 from Beirut, July 10, <persName

        to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that if Parliament was not convened to
        choose a new president as scheduled on July 24, their “national bloc” would enter the ranks
        of the opposition. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> described a number of

      <p>Interview opened on sarcastic note when President said he hoped my government was satisfied
       that he had once and for all buried issue of his re-election in his statement to AP. He added
       we seemed more disposed to listen to our enemies than our friends. I said we were not at all
       happy at turn events in Lebanon had taken and recalled at one time we had indicated our full
       support for his re-election, opportunity for which had been denied by these events. I said
       however if he wished to open on question of elections Department’s 104<note n="4"
        xml:id="d119fn4"><ref target="#d118"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> came at an
       appropriate moment. I then gave him substance of that telegram.</p>
      <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0237"/>
      <p>With scarcely any pause for reflection President said only candidate who could muster
       enough votes in Parliament to be elected July 24 was General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>. When I mentioned candidates favored by Prime Minister (Embtel 244) he
       said neither <persName>Tian</persName> nor Boulos<note n="5" xml:id="d119fn5">Emile Tian,
        former President of the Court of Cassation and former Minister of Justice, and Jawad Boulos,
        writer and well-known political figure.</note> could secure sufficient parliamentary
       support.</p>
      <p>I asked President if he thought <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> could be
       persuaded to run. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he did not know, but he
       was continuing his attempt to persuade him.</p>
      <p>Without mentioning source (Colonel Zouein today) I said an intelligence report<note n="6"
        xml:id="d119fn6">Not found, but see <ref target="#d119fn2">footnote 2</ref> above.</note>
       had reached me that Phalangist and <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> partisans might
       attempt on July 24 to sabotage meeting of Parliament by setting up a fusillade to frighten
       Deputies away. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said categorically and with
       great emphasis this would not happen.</p>
      <p>I likewise informed President of my talk this morning with Reyes (Embtel 244)<note n="7"
        xml:id="d119fn7">In telegram 244, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>
        reported on a meeting with the proprietor of the Bristol Hotel, a Greek Orthodox businessman
        who said that he could produce on July 21 a national congress representing all the business,
        industrial, professional, and labor associations in Lebanon to address the political crisis
        which threatened to paralyze the economy.</note> and his proposal to hold a national
       congress July 21. I indicated Reyes favored <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he had no objection if Reyes could get
       together such a conference.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> All of this looks fairly straightforward, which in itself
       in Lebanon is a cause for suspicion. I recall distrust of President’s motives in favoring
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> voiced by Prime Minister this morning (Embtel
       244) and various reports reaching me that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is
       really angling for a condition of no solution in which performance he would be continued in
       power. As against this however is growing impatience of country at continued stalemate and
       obvious will of important commercial elements that Lebanon find its own solution by July 24.
       Much may depend accordingly on degree of encouragement given to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> by his Turkish and Iraqi friends over this weekend.</p>

      <p>358. President summoned me this morning. He said “Your government” had consistently
       underestimated this warning of danger in Middle East. They had thought he was exaggerating
       for reasons of personal ambition. Now however developments in Baghdad<note n="2"
        xml:id="d121fn2">In telegram 82 from Baghdad, July 14, the Embassy reported that at 5:30
        that morning a group of young army officers, headed by Brigadier <persName
         corresp="#p_QGAK1">Abdul Karim Qassim</persName>, executed a coup against the
         <persName>Royal</persName> family and the government of <persName corresp="#p_alSN1"
         >Nuri</persName> Said, and proclaimed the establishment of the Republican Government of

       wrong.</p>
      <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0240"/>
      <p>President apparently had no hard intelligence on developments in Iraq; certainly none from
       his own sources. He quoted a fairly extensive message which British Chargé had shown him from
       Baghdad which said was far more comprehensive than Baghdad’s 82. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> said lines were open to Amman but he had had no information of troubles
       there following arrest of <persName corresp="#p_ACR2">Radi Abdullah</persName>.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said in addition to our governments having
       underestimated his warnings <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been “blind” and
       Hammarskjold had by his actions given carte blanche to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. Only thing which surprised <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       was that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had not waited until Lebanon had been
       gobbled up but was now starting against Iraq with Jordan next.</p>
      <p>In these circumstances President said he wanted US military intervention in Lebanon within
       48 hours.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he did not wish any more inquiries or
       specifications or conditions re our intervention. He would interpret our intention by our
       deeds. He wanted 6th Fleet here within 48 hours or else he would at last know where he stood
       re assurances of support from West. So far as he was concerned he was determined to go down
       fighting.</p>
      <p>I asked if he had made a similar request of British and French. He said he had already
       called in British Chargé and made such a request; he was seeing French Ambassador at 11:30
       and would likewise ask for French intervention which he understood would be largely symbolic
       because of French lack of means.</p>
      <p>I asked if General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had been informed of these
       appeals and if he was in agreement. He said <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had
       been informed and whether he agreed or not was of no consequence. “He will carry out
       government’s orders—or else”.</p>
      <p>President was in a highly wrought-up mood, obviously angered and filled with a somewhat
       venomous feeling that events had now vindicated him against erroneous judgments of Western
       governments and Western press. Department will note he is making this momentous request
       orally and without other intelligence than what he has heard from Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad
       radios plus one telegram from British Embassy Baghdad.</p>
      <p>I am consulting with French and British colleagues 1 p.m. Will send further comments.</p>

      <p>The group discussed the possible effects of intervention and non-intervention in the Middle
       East, with particular reference to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s request
       (Beirut’s 358).<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2"><ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> As
       a first action Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJL2">Berry</persName> suggested, and General
        <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> agreed, that the delivery of F–86 aircraft
       and other military equipment to Iraq should be suspended at once. Note was also taken of King
        <persName corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName>’s messages (Jidda’s 46 and 47).<note n="3"
        xml:id="d123fn3">Telegrams 46 and 47 from Jidda, July 14, conveyed King <persName
         corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName>’s urgent request for military intervention by the Baghdad
        Pact Powers to reverse the coup in Iraq and to prevent a similar occurrance in Jordan.
        (Department of State, Central Files, 787.00/7–1458; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note></p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> noted that the situation which
       would greet U.S. forces on arrival in Lebanon might be quite different from that pertaining
       now. He also noted that the loyalties of the Iraqi Army are not yet clear, although it seems
       likely that the army will follow the coup group and that Iraq would probably then withdraw
       from the Baghdad Pact, followed by Iran.</p>
      <p>There was general agreement that the effects of the United States doing nothing would be: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would take over the whole area;</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The United States would lose influence not only in the Arab States of the Middle East
         but in the area generally, and our bases throughout the area would be in jeopardy;</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>The dependability of United States commitments for assistance in the event of need
         would be brought into question throughout the world.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> felt that in these circumstances we
       had no alternative but to go in. It was noted too that we would not go into just Lebanon but
       would have to be prepared to go into the whole area; this might involve a “division of labor”
       with the British (going into Iraq and Kuwait), and possibly the Israeli (moving into West
       Jordan), and the Turks (who might be disposed to move into Syria).</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the Sixth Fleet is
       already moving east from the central Mediterranean and that the United States military can
       meet their planned schedule of landings which would get the first battalion landed twelve
       hours after the order is given.</p>
      <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0243"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> attached great importance to having a
       United Nations or other “umbrella” under which to operate so as to give adequate moral
       sanction to our action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> noted this would
       be important in terms of Congressional reaction here and that there would be a disposition in
       some political quarters to equate Western intervention in the Lebanon–Iraq situation to the
       1956 intervention in Suez.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> felt that the scale of Western
       intervention would in great part determine the nature and scale of Soviet reaction. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName> and the Secretary agreed with him that
       intervention involves the risk of general war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HLW1"
        >Henderson</persName> felt that we would face the risk now as well as any time although he
       noted that at least in the beginning part of the non-Communist world would be unfriendly to
       us.</p>

      </list>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> opened with a summary on the
       situation in Iraq. According to reports received thus far (mostly from the rebel-seized
       Baghdad radio), the Crown Prince has been killed, and perhaps <persName corresp="#p_alSN1"
        >Nuri</persName><pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0244"/>also. The King’s situation is
       unknown. A Leftist government has taken over. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> commented that there has been no report regarding Iraqi forces outside of
       Baghdad. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> continued that Hussein’s
       situation is extremely critical in Jordan. Hussein has assumed power as head of the Arab
       Union and supreme commander of the Arab Union armed forces. The Israelis will be extremely
       alarmed; they are likely to take over Transjordan if disorder occurs in Jordan. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has asked for U.S. intervention within forty-eight
       hours, and has indicated he has already asked for U.K. intervention and will ask for French.
       The fate of Kuwait is presently in the balance. Two messages have come from
        Saudi-Arabia.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">See <ref target="#d123fn3">footnote 3, <hi
          rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> King <persName corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName>
       demands action at once, stating that if the United States and United Kingdom do not act now
       they are finished as powers in the Mid-East.</p>
      <p>The President commented that this is probably our last chance to do something in the area.
       While this rebellion continues, we still have a basis for going in, but once it succeeds the
       situation will be different. He did not think we could ignore the situation, but that we must
       move.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then gave a political analysis. The
       situation must be judged in a most serious way, going back to what is fundamental— what will
       the Russians do. If we go in we must expect very threatening gestures, particularly affecting
       Turkey and Iran. What the Russians will do depends upon what they judge to be the balance of
       power for a general war. We are better off now, according to General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, than three or four years from now. At the present
       time the Soviets do not have long-range missiles, at least in any quantity. Nor do they have
       a substantial long-range air capability. If we do not accept the risk now, they will probably
       decide that we will never accept risk and will push harder than ever, and border countries
       will submit to them. If we do not respond to the call from <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>, we will suffer the decline and indeed the elimination of our
       influence—from Indonesia to Morocco. Pakistan may stand with us because of India; Iran would
       gradually go down; Turkey would probably stand firm but with increasing anxieties. In Africa
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is already making gains in Sudan; Libya is in
       the balance; and Tunis and Morocco are already unfriendly.</p>
      <p>If, on the other hand, we do respond to the request, we must expect a very bad reaction
       through most of the Arab countries—a cutting off of the pipeline, stoppage of transit through
       the Suez, and hostile activity throughout the area. The British will have to move into
       Kuwait. <persName corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName> seems to want us to move in, but it is
       questionable if we can control the situation in his country. It must be noted that there is
        <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0245"/>an appreciable chance that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may have overplayed his hand and that if we are firm, he
       may withdraw from what he is doing if the Soviets do not come in.</p>
      <p>If we were to move in we would have to take simultaneous moves in the United Nations and in
       other international forums. The difficulty is that we do not have hard evidence in this case
       as in the case of Lebanon. It must be noted that a meeting of the Baghdad Pact powers at
       Istanbul has been called off, with the representatives other than Iraq going on to meet in
       Ankara. There is good chance that, whatever we do, the Turks will move.</p>
      <p>On balance, the Secretary was inclined to feel that the losses from doing nothing would be
       worse than the losses from action—and that consequently we should send our troops into
       Lebanon. Regarding Iraq, he was not certain as to what we should do. This is primarily a
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> responsibility. He made the further point that if we do
       not act quickly, we are unlikely to act at all—if we don’t act today, we never will and the
       situation will be lost to us. In this connection, the world expects that, if we have a strong
       case we will act promptly, rather than delay. In his opinion, by acting we make general war
       less likely than if we don’t, because in the latter case we will lose our allies. What we
       must decide upon is the lesser of two great evils. We thought we had a third way out in
       Lebanon but with the events in Iraq, that is no longer available to us.</p>
      <p>The President said it was clear in his mind that we must act, or get out of the Middle East
       entirely. He thought that the action of Hussein makes it easier for the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to intervene. What concerns him more than the Russian question is
       the temper or the attitudes of the people throughout the area. He cannot foresee a way of
       bringing the matter to a settlement.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> asked what Israel would do if we
       were to move into Jordan and Iraq. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought
       that, if we go in, Israel will probably stay out. In Saudi Arabia, Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> commented that the power rests with the tribes which
       are loyal to the King.</p>
      <p>The Vice President anticipated that we will undergo an adverse reaction around the world in
       this case, as we gained a favorable reaction at Suez. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> felt that the world will divide on this question, not on intellectual
       grounds but according to instinctive lines. Western Europe will support us, although the
       Scandinavians will be reserved. Most of the Latin American countries will probably do so,
       given persuasion. Most of Asia will be against us, including India, Ceylon and probably Burma
       and most of Africa wherever it is vocal will also. In many areas the leaders will privately
       applaud.</p>
      <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0246"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that in the Defense Department, all
       is in readiness to move. It is unfortunate we do not have a better international aura to move
       under, especially in the United Nations. He recommended placing greater emphasis on the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aspect—getting as much of a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> umbrella as we can. He did feel, though, that if we are going to act we should
       act at once and not wait in hopes of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> finding a solution
       to the problem.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he thought it was clear that
       we should act immediately to call an emergency meeting of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> Security Council.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the plans and
       preparations we have made are enough to protect American lives and property. Two battalions
       of Marines and two Army battle groups from Germany are ready to go. When these go into
       Lebanon, we would load up two divisions in the United States.</p>
      <p>General Persons asked as to whether the President would make a decision without holding a
       bipartisan meeting. The President said he would not but that he would like to have the
       bipartisan leaders down right away. He would simply tell them that we cannot subject
       ourselves to the blackmail <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be able to
       enforce should Lebanon and Iraq follow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName>
       said we would not find much enthusiasm among the Democratic Congressional leaders. The Vice
       President suggested that, while this had been true concerning intervention in Lebanon prior
       to the Iraq coup, it is likely that it is not so true today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1"
        >Macomber</persName> acknowledged this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
        >Anderson</persName> asked whether we could go into Lebanon without giving some assurance to
       Jordan, since Faisal was so close to Hussein. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said it is preferable for us to go to Lebanon, and for the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to go into Iraq and Kuwait. The Vice President said the major
       point to consider is whether this action will succeed, and how long the situation will
       continue. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said this is a situation
       where it will be easy to get ourselves involved, and very hard to get out. However, there
       exists in Lebanon a very strong community having an interest in stability, commerce and ties
       with the West. The Vice President asked what public reason will be given for our
       intervention, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said it would be to
       protect American lives and property at the request of Lebanon. The President added as a
       further reason, because of the increasing danger to the West from these developments.</p>
      <p>The Vice President said these may be mob violence against American embassies and Americans
       throughout the whole Middle East. In a way this is our greatest risk—as to what the mobs will
       do.</p>
      <p>The President said that the situation is clear to him—to lose this area by inaction would
       be far worse than the loss in China, because of the strategic position and resources of the
       Middle East. In further discussion the President commented that the most strategic move would
       be to attack Cairo in the present circumstances, but of course <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215"
        facs="0247"/>this cannot be done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       commented many will say we are simply doing what we stopped the British and the French from
       doing at the time of the Suez crisis. Although there are differences, they will be hard to
       put across.</p>
      <p>The Vice President raised again the matter of consulting Congress. He strongly advised that
       this be done and that the President chair the meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> commented that we should bring out that we can never foresee what will
       happen beyond the initial line of action, but that action is required. The Vice President
       said we should not assume that the Democratic members of Congress will oppose the President’s
       action, at least at this time. Some may. Others will probably be silent, so that they can
       later oppose it if they think it helpful to them to do so.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">After
        the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> drafted and sent a brief
        telegram to Beirut in which he indicated that telegram 358 from Beirut had been considered
        that morning in a meeting with the President, and that, barring strong opposition from the
        Congressional leadership, the response to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
        request very likely would be affirmative. (Telegram 189 to Beirut, July 14; Department of

       <item>There are a few discrepancies in representations made by <persName corresp="#p_CC7"

         <item>To both British Chargé and French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> demanded military intervention within 24 hours. To me he asked
          intervention in 48 hours. I am certain on this because I repeated it back to him, asking
          if he wanted indication of our readiness to intervene in 48 hours or of actual landing of
          forces in that time and he said forces in 48 hours (this may be explained by fact
           <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> thinks Sixth Fleet is deployed
          westward).</item>

         <label>B.</label>
         <item>To British Chargé who called at 10:30 a.m., <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> made it very clear that if allied intervention were not forthcoming
          as requested, he would “appeal to Soviet Union and to <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss>.” British Chargé got definite impression this was an ultimatum. However, when
           <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> mentioned possible need to have recourse to
           <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if west failed him, I took this to be a derisive
          statement. He made similar comment to French Ambassador who made similar
          interpretation.</item>
         <label>C.</label>
         <item>President told both French Ambassador and British Chargé he expected new developments
          in Iraq would result in immediate and fairly large-scale desertion in Moslem elements of
          Lebanese Army. He did not make such an observation to me.</item>
         <label>D.</label>
         <item>To French Ambassador only <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> interpreted
          radio report (Embtel 362)<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">Dated July 14. (Department of State,
           Central Files, 783A.00/7–1458)</note> calling on Iraqi pilots either to return Baghdad or
          assist forces of liberation in Lebanon as a cover to justify intervention from new
          revolutionary regime in Iraq.</item>
        </list></item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>In analyzing <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s mood and motives, all
        three of us are struck by fact he made this very vital request, based entirely on radio
        reports from sources which ordinarily he would have regarded with deepest suspicion, namely
        radios Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad, in rebel hands. His decision was made prior to reading
        British report from Baghdad summarized to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> by
        British Charge. In consequence, it is difficult not to feel that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> may regard this opportunity as his last card to play to bring about
        friendly military intervention in Lebanon. We believe he is sincere in saying integrity and
        independence of Republic are at stake and not his own personal fortunes. However at the same
        time he feels a sense of vindication, that he has been right all along and we wrong.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>As for hard evidence of an increased military threat to Lebanon, it is difficult to
        find this morning. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s statement to French
        Ambassador that Syria would now be free to step up its infiltration of men and matériel and
        that if such a heightened attack occurred, Lebanese Army could not resist more than 48
        hours, we must subject to more cool analysis. We should doubt if Syrian High Command would
        wish thus openly to invite Allied military intervention when it must be preoccupied with
        moves which Turkey may have in contemplation.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>We feel decision on military intervention can only be taken in light of broader
        intelligence and political and strategic considerations affecting the entire Middle East. So
        far as Lebanon alone is concerned, we cannot as of midday discern need for so portentious a
        step.</item>

      <p>The President began by thanking the Congressional group for coming up. He said the
       situation in the Middle East has changed drastically for the worse within the past few hours.
       President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has asked us to come in to assist,
       and American lives and property are endangered in Lebanon. In Iraq the Crown Prince has been
       murdered and Nuri Said may have been murdered as well. Substantial parts of the Army have
       gone over to the rebels, but it is not clear that the bulk of the forces have done so. The
       rebels are of course tied in to groups that are led and influenced by <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
      <p>At the President’s request Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> gave an

       paralleling his report to the President earlier in the day, and giving information concerning
       the situations in Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel in particular.</p>
      <p>At the President’s request Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next
       reviewed the political situation. He started with a discussion of the situation in Lebanon,
       stating that Cairo has been whipping up sentiment on calling for violence by radio. That
       situation had been showing signs of stabilizing up until the Iraq coup. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had decided not to run to succeed himself, and it looked
       as though the problem would work out without loss of Lebanese independence. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> now says he is no longer able unaided to preserve
       Lebanese independence, and we agree, unless the Iraqi forces outside of Baghdad remain loyal
       to the <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0251"/>former regime—this we consider unlikely.
       Thus, we are faced with the question, should we respond to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s appeal. If we go in, our action is likely to accentuate the
       anti-Western feeling of the Arab masses. While the governments of Iraq [<hi rend="italic"
        >Iran</hi>?], Saudi Arabia and Jordan want us to intervene, it is not clear that this action
       will prevent them from being overthrown. Neighboring states such as
        <persName>Sudan</persName>, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco would probably also like for us to
       intervene, but their leaders do not dare to say so. Our intervention would not therefore be
       likely to be a quick and easy solution. However, if we move quickly and decisively the Soviet
       Union—which is undoubtedly behind the whole operation—may feel that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has gone too far too fast and may call on him to pull
       back. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did not think that the Soviets
       wished to risk general war. Their long-range missiles are not ready, and they are far
       inferior in long-range aircraft. Undoubtedly, their violent propaganda against us will
       continue, and there will be danger to our people in the area. While we will probably be able
       through the presence of our forces to hold Lebanon’s independence, we would be drawn into the
       area and it is not clear how we could withdraw.</p>
      <p>The opposite side is that it does not appear we can hold Lebanon free if we do not go in.
       The first consequence of not going in would certainly be that the non-<persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> governments in the Middle East and adjoining areas would
       be quickly overthrown. Thus, whether we go in or not the result will be very bad within the
       Middle Eastern area. Elsewhere, the impact of our not going in—from Morocco to
       Indo–china—would be very unfavorable. Although popular feeling in these countries tends to
       oppose the West, the governments are anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in
       orientation, even though they do not publicly stress this. With regard to Turkey, Iran and
       Pakistan, it is clear that they would feel—if we do not act—that our inaction is because we
       are afraid of the Soviet Union. They will therefore lose confidence. We could expect Turkey
       to continue to work with us but with less firmness and resolution. The question of Iran is
       much more difficult. The Shah tends to vacillate emotionally, and the popular situation is
       not good. We would therefore have to expect a rise in neutralism and an increase in the
       influence of the Soviet Union. Pakistan would stay with us while they are getting equipment
       from us but would not stand up to the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>In summary, in the Secretary’s judgment, if we do not act we will have to take losses
       greater than if we do. We would soon be faced with a stronger Soviet Union, with a worsened
       and weakened situation on our own side.</p>
      <p>We must anticipate an immediate effect on the pipelines and tanker transit through the
       Suez. Offsetting this to some extent is the fact that oil is in better supply than at the
       time of Suez.</p>
      <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>
      <p>From the standpoint of the United Nations, our action to send forces in is entirely
       consonant with the provisions regarding collective defense. We would be putting troops where
       we could act if we found that the disorder arises from a group which is influenced by
       Communist controlled countries. The Secretary said he had just talked with Hammarskjold.<note
        n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">See <ref target="#d126"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>
       Last week the two had agreed that the situation could probably be worked out without
       intervention. The Secretary today told Hammarskjold that the situation has drastically
       changed. He also said we would keep in close touch with the United Nations. Hammarskjold
       himself recognized that the situation had altered. At this point the President asked if we
       had heard anything from the British and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       said we had not.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said we had assumed up until now that if
       it were necessary to go into Lebanon we and the United Kingdom would go in with approximately
       equal numbers of troops, we going in first. He understood General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> thought that it might be desirable if the United
       Kingdom held back, and formed a reserve for possible use in Iraq. He had told Lord Hood of
       this line of thinking. He was confident the British would want to participate in stationing
       armed forces in Lebanon in order to uphold their Middle East position.</p>
      <p>The President then asked Speaker Rayburn if he had any comments. Mr.
        <persName>Rayburn</persName> asked if we go in and intervene and our operation does not
       succeed, what do we do then. He thought the Russians would threaten general war. The
       President said it is not possible to prophesy the exact course of events. If we do or if we
       don’t go in, the consequences will be bad. He thought it was better if we took a strong
       position rather than a Munich-type position, if we are to avoid the crumbling of our whole
       security structure. Mr. <persName>Rayburn</persName> thought that intervention would
       intensify resentment against us throughout the area. The President agreed that, at least on
       the popular level, that would be likely to be true.</p>
      <p>Senator Knowland said he thought we must respond to the appeal from <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or see the whole area go down the drain piece by piece.
       Throughout the world a failure on our part to act would be a tremendous victory for <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. In his opinion we are in fact at a turning point in
       history. The President pointed out we would be going into Lebanon at the request of <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, and that our action would be a symbol of American
       fortitude and readiness to take risks to defend the values of the free world. If Iraq and
       Jordan ask the British to come in, we would have to consider what our own action should be.
       Senator Knowland suggested calling the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
       into session. He thought a token force from Iran and Turkey would also be needed.</p>
      <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0253"/>
      <p>Speaker Rayburn asked if these are not civil wars. The President said that they have that
       appearance, but in fact they are being fomented by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. He stressed the danger there would be to the West to be cut off from
       Middle Eastern oil. Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName> asked what agreements expressed or
       implied we have with Lebanon that would require us to come to their support. Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that they received at the benefit of the
       Middle East resolution in three respects—first, economic and military assistance to those
       that desire it to preserve their independence; the declaration that the integrity and
       independence of the countries of the area are vital to the security of the United States; and
       third, the President’s authority to intervene to oppose an armed attack by a country
       dominated by international communism. He added that we are not planning to act under the
       third category above. It is our thought that the presence of our troops will stabilize the
       situation. In addition, the tri-partite declaration of 1950 extends to the countries of the
       area. He recalled that he had said that we wouldn’t send in forces if the United Nations
       could handle the situation. Today the new situation is such that it could whip through the
       entire Middle East if left unchecked. Senator <persName>Russell</persName> asked what we plan
       to do in Iraq. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he had no present
       plans because we do not know enough. We must find out the thinking of the United Kingdom,
       Turkey and Iran. Senator <persName>Russell</persName> said he had no doubt that our troops
       will be engaged in hostilities if we go into Lebanon. However, he said he was prepared to see
       us go if our security requires it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       said we must certainly expect some sniping, but we have some grounds to hope that full-scale
       opposition will not develop. However, he felt that if the world comes to believe that we will
       not take risks we are heading for a series of disasters. He recognized that going in has many
       liabilities. Hostilities may spread, and we may take a heavy beating in propaganda. Senator
        <persName>Russell</persName> said that the Soviet prestige is also committed. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out it has not yet been committed, and that this
       is why we must act quickly. Senator <persName>Russell</persName> said he had hoped that, if
       we had to intervene, we could intervene on a basis in which world opinion would be with
       us.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that there is not much of a choice in his view. If we
       do not go in we are likely to lose our whole position in the Middle East. He thought that the
       British should put at least a small force into Lebanon with us.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that Lebanon is the one
       country that joined the Middle East resolution. They feel that for that reason they have
       undergone extra pressure. They feel that we are morally bound to help them.</p>
      <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0254"/>
      <p>Senator Mansfield said that he did not think the tri-partite agreement would hold because
       this is a civil disturbance. He considered that we would be getting into a civil war, and
       hoped that before American troops go in we would put the matter before the United
       Nations.</p>
      <p>Congressman <persName>Vorys</persName> asked what our forces would do. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that three battalions and two battle groups would
       be landed in Beirut to protect lives and property and support the Lebanese government. They
       would be under the command of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>. He
       did not think there would be heavy fighting and did not anticipate they would have to fight
       their way ashore.</p>
      <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> asked whether reasonable men would think we have
       broken our word to Lebanon if we do not go in. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said that governments will feel that we have reneged on an agreement.
       World opinion will be divided. Generally our friends will think that we did the right thing
       if we go in, and the wrong thing if we do not. Our foes will take just the opposite view.
       Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> thought that we gained world respect at the time of
       the Suez incident. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out some
       of the differences in the situation. In the present case a country is under attack and has
       invited us in. Because this is a civil war the situation is unclear and therefore more
       difficult. He recalled, however, that the Soviet had claimed that Korea was a civil war. The
       key point is as to whether the strife is fomented, inspired and aided from without. We have a
       great deal of intelligence as to the money, arms and forces that have been sent in from
       outside. If we were to adopt the doctrine that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       can whip up a civil war without our intervention, our friends will go down to defeat. He
       cited the “essentials of peace” resolution in the United Nations which provided that nations
       should refrain from fomenting civil war.<note n="5" xml:id="d127fn5">See <ref
         target="#d102fn2">footnote 2, Document 102</ref>.</note> It also brought out that we must
       look to the real source of the impetus for internal strife.</p>
      <p>Congressman Albert asked whether we could not retaliate in kind, and outdo <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Syria in subversion. It was pointed out that we have
       no successful record in this regard.</p>
      <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> recalled that the United Nations
       had found that the strife is not being supported from the outside. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this finding was that, at the moment the
       inspection was made, support was not moving across the border, but was silent as to earlier
       movement. The United Nations sent observers and the situation was tending to calm down, but
       had now been greatly stirred up.</p>
      <p>Senator <persName>Russell</persName> asked whether, if the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian
       governments were to fall, we would have to go in. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said we have no relation with them comparable to Lebanon. <pb n="223"
        xml:id="pg_223" facs="0255"/>They could, however, seek to invoke the Middle East doctrine.
       The President commented that <persName corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName> has sent us word
       that if we do not come in we are finished in the Middle East. Senator Bridges said that he
       believes we have a commitment to go to the aid of Lebanon and that we must keep it. He
       thought that control of the Middle Eastern oil is of determining effect on the free world’s
       future. If the Middle East goes, all of Africa immediately goes as well.</p>
      <p>Congressman <persName>Vinson</persName> stated that we must make up our minds to go the
       distance—that he thought we must envisage deeper involvement. The President said he believes
       that when we decided to resort to force we must be ready to use whatever force is necessary.
       The whole group knew how repugnant to him the resort to force would be. He did believe,
       however, that free government is on trial. While this could be a terrible thing he would
       welcome suggestions if anyone could tell him a better line of action. Really we are standing
       for just what we have stood for since 1947 and the attack on Greece. Mr.
        <persName>Vorys</persName> recalled that the Soviets had claimed that the Greek affair was a
       civil war and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed.</p>
      <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> asked when, if our operation succeeds, we will be
       able to get out. The President said there is one thing about war he would stress—we must
       expect it to be different from what was initially anticipated. The free world is going to
       have to make sacrifices if it is going to win through. He recognized that even this group,
       with all its wisdom, would find this a terribly difficult decision to make. However, we are
       faced with war-like struggle, and we must accept the burdens of defense.</p>
      <p>The President asked how soon an emergency session of the United Nations could be called.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said it could be done within minutes after
       a decision was taken. He commented that by the following day it should be possible to see the
       situation more clearly in Iraq. Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName> asked whether it would not
       be better to send our troops in before calling the emergency session. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it would be—thus we would put our prestige on
       the line before the Soviets do. Accordingly, we cannot allow much time to pass before acting.
       Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName> asked whether the President would act by legislation or
       under his powers as Commander in Chief. The President said he thought legislation would be
       needed before too long, but that if he tried to act after a debate the Soviets would be able
       to forestall us. He therefore thought he would be obliged to take action, were he to decide
       on this course, and then put the matter before Congress. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we would not be sending our troops in to
       fight, but on a basis more like that by which they are now in some twenty-five other nations
       in which we station troops.</p>
      <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0256"/>
      <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> said that it is not clear that
       this crisis is Soviet-or Communist-inspired. He said that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> is playing his own game. The President commented that there is not enough
       hard intelligence to be completely sure. It is clear, however, that whatever <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may think he is doing, the Soviets have a tremendous
       interest in this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> recalled that
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had recently visited Moscow and that his
       presence at the present time in Yugoslavia is the result of long-standing arrangements.
       Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> asked whether <gloss
        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had had notice of the coup in Iraq. [<hi rend="italic">1 line
        of source text not declassified</hi>] Senator Green commented that we do not know the full
       facts of the matter as yet. He said there is much that we could lose in war, but more that we
       could lose if we don’t make good on our agreements.</p>
      <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> asked whether we have consulted our allies—specifically
       the British and the Turks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the
       Turks have been pressing us hard to take this action. The British believe the action should
       be taken. Also the Israelis, the French and the Iranians have been pressing us. Senator Wiley
       said he had two further questions—is it necessary in the interest of America that this should
       be done, and what will public opinion be throughout the world. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled his earlier statement that reaction will follow
       existing division. The West will applaud us and probably Latin America also. In Asia, India
       and Burma will oppose. There is not much vocal expression in Africa. He did feel it is clear
       that the backbones of our friends will dissolve if we do not go in. Senator Wiley asked as to
       the strength of Egyptian forces and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
       said that they are not in a high status of military capability. The principal problems facing
       our forces would be the people of the area and its great spaces.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Morgan</persName> asked whether, if we do go into Lebanon, the Soviets are
       likely to go into Iraq. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
       they might send in volunteers but he would not see it as likely unless the British, Turks or
       Iranians send in their forces. Mr. <persName>Morgan</persName> said the North Koreans are
       demanding the removal of our troops from South Korea and asked if there is any connection
       between this and the Middle Eastern events. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> did not think so.</p>
      <p>Congressman Chiperfield thought that we had no possible choice but to send our troops into
       Lebanon. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> asked whether, if the
       Soviets were not involved, this would make any difference to us. For example, if we felt that
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is independent and not subject to direction by
       the Soviet Union, could we not then hope that he would collapse of his own weight. But with a
       close working arrangement between him and the Soviets, a victory for him is a victory for
       Soviet communism. The President commented that one crucial question is what the victims
       believe. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> believes it is Soviet communism that
       is causing him his trouble.</p>
      <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0257"/>
      <p>Senator <persName>Russell</persName> asked whether, if we send in forces, we would have to
       mobilize and strengthen our own forces. The President did not think it would be necessary
       immediately, but said that two divisions would be alerted and made ready to move. Mr.
        <persName>McCormack</persName> asked what the NSC had thought of this. The President said
       that he had met with the statutory members of the NSC in his office and that they had laid
       out alternatives and had seemed to feel that the alternative of doing nothing was worse than
       the other. He did want to stress, however, that this is not a matter of a decision already
       taken—that he wanted to hear the full views of the group and then try to reach a decision.
       General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> commented that if we do not go in we
       must expect to lose the Middle East and Africa and encourage Communist expansion in the Far
       East. We must recognize, however, that the situation might spread if we do go in. In that
       case our forces are ready.</p>
      <p>Senator Mansfield said that there are questions of prestige and policy involved and
       suggested consideration of the possibility of requesting a United Nations emergency session
       and going in on a multilateral basis. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       said that in his talk with Hammarskjold they had discussed the need for some way to make
       Lebanon a ward of the United Nations. He did expect to have a meeting of the United Nations
       Security Council tomorrow morning. He recalled that under Article 51 member states are
       allowed to act until the United Nations can itself take action. Anything that we do will be
       in the nature of an initial reaction to the situation, until an adequate <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force replaces us. We cannot, however, wait to see what they will
       do. The President asked what we will do, supposing we went in and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> were to condemn us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he
       thought we would have to pull out. Speaker Rayburn said he felt that if we are going to do
       this we should not wait for the United Nations. Senator Knowland asked concerning statements
       to the press, referring to the question of leakage before the President and the government
       take action. He hoped the discussion within the meeting could be kept secure and simply say
       that it was a briefing on the Middle East. The President said he knew that everyone was
       conscious of the need to avoid even inadvertent disclosures and suggested that there had
       simply been an examination of alternatives. Mr. <persName>Rayburn</persName> said he would
       say simply that there was discussion on the situation in the Middle East. Senator
        <persName>Russell</persName> suggested that the President should make a statement at once.
       The President said we would be working on one, and in addition studying our probable needs
       for money for which we would have to make a request to the Congress.</p>
      <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0258"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Rayburn</persName> concluded by saying that only one person should make a
       statement on the matter, and that should be the President.</p>

      </list>
      <p>Following the President’s meeting with the Congressional Leaders, the above group stayed in
       his office to fix firmly upon specific action steps.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that Lord Hood had talked with
       him, indicating the Prime Minister is available for phone conversation with the President,
       should the President so desire, and also that <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn
        Lloyd</persName> thinks he should come over to talk with us (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> did not think this is necessary), and finally that, if we go into
       Lebanon, the British would have to go into Iraq, and they would want to know if we can help
       and support them there. The President said that it might be better to put our troops into
       Lebanon unilaterally. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled that we had
       been working closely with the British on this whole matter. He also said that the United
       Kingdom has been asked by King Hussein of Jordan for help. The President said he thought we
       could give them logistical support, but did not see how we could commit ourselves quickly to
       do more (since this would exceed his constitutional authority without legislative
       action).</p>
      <p>There was next discussion as to when our forces should be put ashore, and when any
       statement should be made about it. The President stressed strongly that he did not want to
       make any statement until the landing is actually taking place. It must be done with complete
       surprise—otherwise opposition could be organized, and we <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227"
        facs="0259"/>should be under great pressures politically. He thought <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could be notified about an hour and a half ahead of the
       landing (later he agreed this might be as much as three hours).</p>
      <p>He thought a platoon or so should be sent in ahead to clear and secure a direct space. He
       would prefer the landing to be made at the dock rather than over the beach in anything like
       combat style.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> thought that a decision now to go ahead
       would leave us free to move immediately to the United Nations. He thought there was great
       merit in giving notice to the United Nations in advance of a landing.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> said that some of the Congressmen who
       were in attendance this afternoon have already been leaking to the press information about
       the meeting. The President said there was a lot of difference between leaks and an official
       statement as to intentions.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that we cannot depend on
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to be able to hold his position too long, and
       that we must therefore plan to move at the earliest possible time.</p>
      <p>After further discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
       we could now take an action in the form of announcing a call for an emergency meeting of the
       United Nations Security Council for a time as early as possible tomorrow morning. The
       President thought that our best course is to put our forces ashore in Lebanon, with the
       United Kingdom holding its force ready for Iraq or Jordan. He asked how long our First Marine
       battalion would be on the ground by itself, and General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
        >Twining</persName> indicated that it would be something like twelve hours.</p>
      <p>There was discussion as to what could be said at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       meeting if we have put our forces ashore just prior to that meeting. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he could stress that events have taken a grave
       turn, that we have been invited in, and that we are going in. The President interjected that
       we could add that we seek to stabilize the situation until the United Nations can act.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> stressed that we will need a statement
       to put out at about 4 or 5 AM tomorrow, assuming that our forces go in to land just twelve
       hours from the time of this meeting. The President suggested that the landing be at about 3
       PM Lebanon time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would have a statement
       ready at 8 AM our time to be given out by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>
       at the moment we know our forces are ashore. We could include in this announcement a
       statement that the President will have a statement to the Nation at about noon.</p>
      <p>During the discussion it was made clear that Defense should order the landing of the
       advance Marine contingent at 3 PM, should order elements of the Sixth Fleet now in the
       Western Mediterranean to move at once to the Eastern Mediterranean (it was recognized that
       the press would undoubtedly take some notice of this) and that the two battle groups to be
       moved down from Germany should receive their movement <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0260"
       />orders at approximately the same time as the initial landings in Lebanon (i.e., should
       begin their assembly some time tomorrow afternoon Wiesbaden time).</p>

      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that it had been a very disturbing
       day. There was little firm news from Baghdad. King Faisal’s and <persName corresp="#p_alSN1"
        >Nuri</persName>’s whereabouts were unknown. Fadhil Jamali, Abdul Ilah, <persName
        corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName>’s son, and a number of others were reported killed. There
       was no clear indication as to the extent of resistance, if any, to the coup d’etat. The
       rebels appeared to have firm control of Baghdad radio. The British Embassy had been sacked.
       The situation had all the earmarks of a pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
       anti-Western coup.</p>
      <p>The situation in Jordan was precarious, but King Hussein was determined and was in control.
       He had recently announced his assumption of the functions of Chief of the Arab Union.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> continued that the purpose of the
       meeting was to consult with the Ambassadors and to express to them our concern over the
       situation in Iraq. A great deal of thought had been given to this matter at the highest level
       in the U.S. Government. We were concerned because we believed perhaps there was a connection
       between the situations in Iraq and Lebanon. We had asked for a meeting of the Security
       Council for the following morning. This would be a very <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229"
        facs="0261"/>important meeting. He wished he were in a position to tell them what we were
       planning but the details were still being worked out and he could say only that we would take
       action responsive to the situation.</p>
      <p>The Pakistani Ambassador asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> meant
       by this that we were planning to take action in Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> replied affirmatively. The Pakistani Ambassador asked how this could be
       effective if we did not at the same time back up Jordan which also was seriously threatened
       by the events in Iraq. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> replied that we
       were seriously concerned with the situation in Jordan and were watching it closely but that
       we would have to cross that particular bridge when we came to it. Our planned action in
       Lebanon would be evidence of the seriousness of our concern for the situation throughout the
       Middle East. The Iranian Ambassador asked if the Security Council was being called to discuss
       Iraq or Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> replied that Lebanon was
       to be the subject of the discussion and that at the meeting we would inform the Security
       Council of the action we were taking and the reasons for it.</p>
      <p>The Iranian Ambassador said that this was a very wise decision. The Pakistani Ambassador
       said that the real showdown had come. Our action now would determine whether we would make a
       strategic retreat or face up to the Soviet menace in the Middle East. The Iranian Ambassador
       said that as he understood our plans, by giving support to Lebanon we would give support to
       Hussein and would let our friends in Iraq know that we were still a force to be reckoned
       with. The people of the area would know that the United States was serious in its intent.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that in general he agreed with
       this analysis. The difficulty with the Iraqi situation was that as yet we did not have many
       facts about it. There might be loyal elements or the coup might be completely successful. The
       Iranian Ambassador said that he wished to be forgiven for mentioning it but two years ago the
       Iranians had been informed that their fears regarding Syria were exaggerated. Events had
       proved the Iranians correct. A year ago he personally had told the British Ambassador that
       something was going on beneath the surface in Iraq. The Turkish Ambassador said that he and
       his colleagues had not been surprised by the coup and felt that now was the time to stop the
       steady decline of the Western position in the area.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> replied that the trend of events in the
       Middle East over the last several years had been fairly clear to us. The danger of Communism
       had been clear. The danger of the spread of Nasserism had been even clearer. We had realized
       the tremendous appeal of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> throughout the Arab
       World. It was obvious that this was a problem with which only local governments could deal.
       We had tried to work with these governments and support them. He agreed that the coup in Iraq
       was not totally unexpected, but the rapidity of action, not preceded by rumors of an
       impending coup, was most unusual in the <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0262"/>Arab world.
       As a result of rumors and reports regarding a similar situation in Jordan, King Hussein had
       been much more on guard than King Faisal and had been able to take action to forestall a
       planned coup.</p>
      <p>The Turkish Ambassador said that this was an important moment in which the United States
       should join the Baghdad Pact in order to save the situation. This was the time to show that
       the United States was really concerned. He asked if it was not necessary now to reconsider
       U.S. policy toward Nasser. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> inquired what
       the Turkish Ambassador considered to be U.S. policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. The Turkish Ambassador replied that because of our desire to get along
       with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> we had been lukewarm in our support of the
       Arab Union.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> replied that this was absolutely
       fallacious. We had wanted to help and had supported fully the Arab Union. We had offered
       large amounts of money to cover the Union’s budget deficit. We had been carrying Jordan on
       our shoulders for a year and one-half. We were willing and ready to support the Arab Union
       but we could not do everything. We could not put the Iraqis and Jordanians together and force
       them to cooperate effectively. This was something they had to do for themselves. With regard
       to our policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> we had not resumed
       economic aid to him and our release of frozen Egyptian assets had been made because there was
       no legal justification for retaining them in the U.S. after a settlement had been reached
       between Egypt and the Suez Canal Company. We understood Nasser. Our troubles with him were
       not concerned with the situation in Egypt but with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s desire to subvert other states while we were committed to support their
       independence and integrity.</p>
      <p>The Pakistani Ambassador referred to statements made in the Congress earlier in the day
       critical of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine and the Baghdad
       Pact. He said that such statements were very disturbing to people in the area, who did not
       understand the American constitutional system and who thought these were official statements
       of the U.S. Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> noted that this
       was one of the difficulties of foreign policy in a democratic state where freedom of speech
       and expression were maintained.</p>

      <p>The President said first: “You have all the news and intelligence on Iraq and know how it
       exacerbates the Lebanon situation. President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       has asked us both to go in. We have decided to implement the plan (for your very secret
       information). As I understand it, the contingent of yours is about 3, 700, and it is
       apparently in the lift that gets in somewhere toward the rear of the procession.”</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Yes, that’s right.</p>
      <p>The President: It is just possible that in view of the Jordan situation that I understand
       has been put in your lap, you may want to hold those people a little bit in reserve as the
       situation develops in Lebanon. <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0264"/>I just wanted to say
       that if there is that much modification in the military plan if you thought it wise to make
       it you could do that unilaterally.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Yes, but the thought is this: if we do this thing with the Lebanese it
       is only really part of a much larger operation, because we shall be driven to take the thing
       as a whole, and I want to feel that if we treat it as a whole it looks like a showdown.</p>
      <p>The President: Of course, you must understand that so far as we are concerned, as of this
       moment we can’t talk about anything happening elsewhere. I agree with you that the situation
       must contemplate more than that.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Yes, I agree the situation is going to be hard. It will start off all
       the row with the pipelines, with the bigger things, but this will stand right up to them. If
       this thing is done, which I think is very noble, dear friend, it will set off a lot of things
       throughout the whole area. I’m all for that as long as we regard it as an operation that has
       got to be carried through.</p>
      <p>The President: Now just a minute so that there is no misunderstanding. Are you of the
       belief that unless we have made up our minds in advance to carry this thing on through to the
       Persian Gulf, that we had better not go in the first place?</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: I don’t think that, but I think that we have got to see it together,
       dear friend. There is no good in being in that place and sitting there a few months and the
       whole rest being in flames. As soon as we start we have to face it—we have probably got to do
       a lot of things.</p>
      <p>The President: Well, now, I will tell you of course I would not want to go further. Today
       we tried to project in our discussions here I and with the legislative leaders the
       development of the situation, and they could take many forms. If we are now planning the
       initiation of a big operation that could run all the way through Syria and Iraq, we are far
       beyond anything I have to [<hi rend="italic">the?</hi>] power to do constitutionally. We have
       had quite some trouble justifying to our own leaders what we intend to do.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Yes. What is your time-table?</p>
      <p>The President: Right now. It would take—I don’t know the exact time that they will get
       there on account of the orders and hours, but I would not want to give any information over
       an open wire.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Of course. Now, are you going to speak to the country?</p>
      <p>The President: Yes. This is very secret. We are calling an emergency session of the
       Security Council for tomorrow morning. I will broadcast after that Council does
       something.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Tomorrow?</p>
      <p>The President: Well, probably.</p>
      <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0265"/>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Well, now, we have had a request from the two little chaps—the one is
       gone and the other is there, the king—</p>
      <p>The President: We did not know what the final reports were.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: I know there is little news. The second is going along for the other.
       We have got a sort of request from him saying that [<hi rend="italic">what?</hi>] are we
       going to do. I feel, my dear friend, that if you set off this great show, which I think is
       fine, you can’t confine it to what you say publicly, but in fact all the trouble will blitz
       through on destroyers, oil fields, pipelines. Taking on Turks and getting things back. We
       should be ruined. I am for it. I don’t want you to say that now to me, but so long as I
       understand we are in this together. We are doing this together.</p>
      <p>The President: My own idea would be this. If this situation develops where our whole
       national interests are abandoned and destroyed, I have to go before the Congress and ask for
       authority to act. We can understand and agree on that much. And that is exactly what you say,
       except I have to say it in my guarded terms.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: You see, we shall have a terrible reaction. Do you want us to come with
       you or do you want to do it alone?</p>
      <p>The President: At this moment, not knowing now under the new situation where your people
       may be needed, I think they should be alerted and then whatever happens, we will do it that
       way.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: We must support the whole thing in public and all that. It is the whole
       that matters. That is what we have to deal with.</p>
      <p>The President: Of course, as of this moment that has been—we don’t know what is going to
       happen and I think it would be very bad for you and me to talk over an open wire to discuss
       the great possibilities.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: What is your timing? Is it now seven o’clock?</p>
      <p>The President: No, it is six o’clock here.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: What have you got to do about speaking?</p>
      <p>The President: No, not tonight. This is very secret.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: I will send you a good message by wire, and you will get it in an hour
       or two. There are many things I can’t say over the wire.</p>
      <p>The President: Yes, do that. Tell the Ambassador here to get a copy of it instantly to the
       Secretary of State.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: I will write something out and get it to you in an hour. I will send it
       to Foster.</p>
      <p>The President: Now, on the rest of it, we will talk about these possibilities and what we
       have to be prepared to do. I realize we are opening a Pandora’s Box here, but if we don’t
       open it, I think it is disastrous.</p>
      <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0266"/>
      <p>The Prime Minister: Yes, I quite agree with you. What I mean is the old box when it is
       opened does a lot of harm. I am all for it.</p>
      <p>The President: You’d better send a message laying out your thoughts on it.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister: I will send you a message on those lines where I can speak more
       clearly.</p>
      <p>Then the President turned to the Secretary, at the conclusion of the phone call, and said
       he talked about destruction of oil lines, then we are really at war, then what do we do? He
        (<persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>) says we can’t sit down in Lebanon and do
       nothing, while the British are taking the hard knocks all over the area trying to get this
       thing straight. (And the President added he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName>.) But, the President continued, he tried to tell <persName
        corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> that he, the President, cannot make a decision such
       as this. We have now to justify our immediate action, which is that we did honor commitments.
       The President repeated that <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> would sent a
       cable immediately which he said would be through in an hour.<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2"
        >According to Greene, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded from this
        conversation that some doubt remained “about whether the British will go in with us at all.”
         <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, on the other hand, subsequently told
         <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that his opinion of <persName
         corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> had gone up as a result of the conversation. He had
        asked for an assurance of British support and felt that <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
         >Macmillan</persName> was “very fine” in providing it. (Memorandum of telephone

       situation in the Middle East generally, justifies and indeed demands, urgent action.</p>
      <list>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Intervention in the Lebanon in response to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName>’s request is certainly made much more necessary by what has happened in
        Iraq. No doubt you will justify it in the United Nations and to the world in general as
        action against interference both from Egypt and from Syria against the independence of
        another state. We shall certainly give you full support in any action you decide to
        take.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>What I was trying to say on the telephone was that the action you contemplate must not
        necessarily have great repercussions. It will set off a lot of trouble. The installations at
        Tripoli cannot be immediately protected, and will probably be destroyed, and all the
        pipelines through Syria will be cut. There may also be attacks on other oil installations
        throughout the whole area, all of which will inflict great loss upon the international
        companies and particularly upon us who depend on sterling oil. I have talked this over with
        my colleagues and we are quite prepared to face these risks if it is part of a determination
        between us both to face the issues and be prepared to protect Jordan with the hope of
        restoring the situation in Iraq. With regard to the Persian Gulf which you mentioned, we
        have already taken preliminary steps and I hope we shall be able to handle this ourselves.
        Of course I understand your difficulties with Congress and there is also the United Nations
        which will have to be handled. I also understand that you must seek the necessary authority
        step by step. But what I would like to feel is that it is our joint intention, not merely to
        be content with rescuing Lebanon (not very important in itself) but to face the wider issues
        together.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Now with regard to the Lebanon expedition. I think you are right in feeling that our 3,
        700 men should be held in reserve: they may very soon be needed elsewhere. We will of course
        give the fullest public support here and in the United Nations and through all our friends
        in the Commonwealth and in friendly countries with whom we have influence. I want you to
        feel that we are completely with you in this enterprise. If you decide that you do not want
        us for the Beirut expedition, will you please let us know at once. One minor point. It
        occurs to me that it might be wiser for you to inform the Canadians yourselves. It also, I
        think, might be wise for you to inform India. We would of course send our own messages to
        these two countries and to the other Commonwealth countries.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>To sum up. I should like to feel that you agree with me that in the new situation the
        Lebanon cannot be looked at by itself. Indeed if these events had not happened in Iraq we
        would probably be carrying on the policy on which we were working together up till today;
        that is to hope for a political settlement in the Lebanon and a gradual quietening <pb
         n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0268"/>down of the situation. Now Lebanon is only part of a
        much wider crisis. But, if you decide to go into the Lebanon realising all that is involved,
        we will give you every support. I am sending you a separate message about Jordan.<note n="3"

         independence of Lebanon; (d) forceful and factual statement of infiltrations that continue
         seriously threaten independence and integrity of Lebanon; (e) expression of deep concern
         that recent grave developments in Iraq, and plots in Jordan constitute grave further threat
         to independence of Lebanon; (f) expression intention <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>

      <p>Last evening Lord Hood brought me two messages to the President from <persName
        corresp="#p_MHS2">Harold Macmillan</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">See <ref
         target="#d132">Document 132</ref> and <ref target="#d134fn3">footnote 3</ref>
        thereto.</note></p>
      <p>With respect to the Prime Minister’s wish to feel “that it is our joint intention, not
       merely to be content with rescuing Lebanon (not very important in itself), but to face the
       wider issues together”, I told Lord Hood that in general we would agree, although it is hard
       to see at the moment what the course of events will be in Iraq or what we could do. I also
       indicated we would be prepared to help in meeting the problem of oil if, as the Prime
       Minister’s message suggests, the pipelines are cut.</p>
      <p>On the point in paragraph 4 as to whether we want the British in on the Lebanon landing, I
       said that if it is militarily feasible for the British to hold back from the initial
       operation as planned, that would be agreeable to us.</p>
      <p>I said we would instruct Ambassador Bunker to inform Nehru and that we have already
       informed the Canadians.</p>
      <p>As to the Jordanian request for assurance that we will come to their assistance, I told
       Lord Hood that this was a totally new question, not covered by our present military planning,
       and that I did not therefore feel that at the moment we could either give King Hussein the
       assurance he sought or accept the British suggestion that we urge him to request the
       assurance at once. We would, however, give this matter urgent study.</p>
      <p>We discussed where the 3700 British troops earmarked for the initial operation in Lebanon
       might go if they do not join our forces. Lord Hood said that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
        >HMG</gloss> would be prepared to send them to Jordan and emphasized that action in Jordan
       is seen in London as a necessary complement to action in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>I said that I could not give any considered view of what to do about Jordan without
       consulting our military and political advisers but that my off-hand thought was that Hussein
       has a better chance of pulling through without western military assistance than with it.</p>
      <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0271"/>
      <p>I told Lord Hood also with regard to <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>’s
       message to me<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3"><p>The following message was passed from <persName

       which could be picked up in Arabic transmissions throughout Middle East. Anything an Arab

      <p>I likewise told President that of course we wished to provide him personally with maximum
       security but for political reasons I would very much hope presidential palace could be
       defended by Lebanese security forces. He agreed and said he would not call on our protection
       unless in case of last resort.</p>
      <p>I pointed out that since British are not landing in initial phase of operation and may not
       land at all, it seemed to be unnecessary to request French participation. I repeated same
       observation to French Ambassador who called at 1100. Roche was most reasonable and said he
       entirely agreed that if this were solely an American operation, there was no need for French
       participation. I hope same line of reasoning will prevail in Paris.</p>

      <p>The Secretary of State called the President—8:40 AM. The Secretary said that he had had
       quite a little talk with Lord Hood last night on messages from the Prime Minister.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d137fn2">See <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note> The British are greatly
       concerned that we should commit ourselves to act with them in Jordan and possibly Iraq. The
       Secretary last night told <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> that he could not
       possibly give him an answer on that last night and that, further, the President would not
       want to give any answer without careful check <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0274"/>with
       the military and area advisers. The Secretary said that the British were particularly
       concerned with the Iraq business because they have tremendous investment in oil there and in
       nearby Kuwait.</p>
      <p>The Secretary went on to say that as far as Lebanon was concerned, we were on pretty solid
       ground—that there was a large segment of the population on our side there. In the other
       countries the thing might blow up—for instance, what would you do with the refugees in
       Jordan? The Secretary finally told Lord Hood that he could not possibly give them an answer
       until the latter part of the day.</p>
      <p>The Secretary reiterated that Lord Hood wants a commitment that we (the British and the
       Americans) will stand together on this situation. The Secretary says we cannot give them a
       blank check. He said that if the British were worried about the oil situation, if the Iraq
       pipe line is destroyed, that we would of course help them meet their shortages.</p>
      <p>To intervene militarily would introduce problems that we have not even considered.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that King Hussein had asked if we (and
       the British) would be willing to intervene if we were called on. The British think he should
       be asked to call on us right away. The President said he did not think so. <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the British do not want the situation to drift. The
       President said we all agreed what we should do in Lebanon—we have studied that carefully.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he had sent over a statement to be
       issued as soon as the planes reach Lebanon (which should be within 15 minutes). <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked if the President had given thought to whether he
       would go before Congress—and the President replied he was going to talk to the staff this
       morning. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said it was very hard to tell how to
       play it— there are some advantages and some disadvantages in going before the Congress. The
       latter makes a much greater affair of the action, looks like a declaration of war.</p>

        Lodge</persName> laid out the background of the U.S. intervention in Lebanon, and stressed
       “the sole purpose of helping the Government of Lebanon at its request in its efforts to
       stabilize the situation, brought on by threats from outside, until such time as the United
       Nations can take the steps necessary to protect the independence and political integrity of
       Lebanon.” <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out that the tense situation
       in the Middle East had been exacerbated by the coup in Iraq and by persistent efforts to
       subvert the Government of Jordan. Together those developments had jeopardized “both the
       independence of Lebanon and that of any Middle Eastern state which seeks to maintain its
       national integrity free from outside influences and pressures.” U.S. forces, <persName
        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stated, would remain in Lebanon only until stability was
       restored or until the United Nations assumed “the necessary responsibilities to insure the
       continued independence of Lebanon.” (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> Press Release
       2956; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pages 960–964)</p>
      <p>Later in the day, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> introduced a draft
       resolution calling for the United Nations to take over the defense of Lebanon. (<hi
        rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> pages 967–968) President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> also sent a special message to Congress on July 15 to explain the
       United States intervention in Lebanon. (White House Press Release, July 15; <hi rend="italic"
        >ibid.,</hi> pages 965–967) In the evening of July 15, the principal radio and television
       networks carried an address from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
       to the nation in which he expanded upon the rationale for intervention in Lebanon outlined in
       his initial statement that morning. (White House Press Release, July 15; <hi rend="italic"

      <p>The President and the Vice President talked a little more about situation in Mid East.<note
        n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Shortly before this conversation with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> called <persName
         corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and discussed the announcement of the troop landing in
        Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> complimented <persName
         corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> for his handling of the Congressional briefing on the
        previous day. Of the decision to intervene, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
        said “if it works we are heroes and if not we are bums,” but he added that nothing would be
        worse than waiting for the United Nations to act. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Dulles
        Papers, General Telephone Conversations; included in the microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>The President said we had come to the crossroads. Since 1945 we have been trying to
       maintain the opportunity to reach vitally needed petroleum supplies peaceably, without
       hindrance on the part of any one. The present incident comes about by the struggle of
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to get control of these supplies—to get the
       income and the power to destroy the Western world. Somewhere along the line we have got to
       face up to the issue. It is too bad. You see the mistakes that were made.</p>
      <p>The President said he was sure of one thing: we need a strong powerful voice speaking in
       the Mid East—powerful in the terms of technical capacity and a man (as well as a station)
       that could present the Western point of time [<hi rend="italic">view?</hi>] all the time and
       who would also support legitimate nationalism. The trouble is that we have a campaign of
       hatred against us, not by the governments but by the people. The people are on <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s side.</p>
      <p>The Vice President then gave the President his ideas as to how the talk to the nation, or
       to reporters, should present the case. For the United States, the argument has to be tied to
       Mid East oil; for world opinion you cannot allow it to appear that the Mid East countries are
       simply a pawn in the big power contest for their resources. What is required, the Vice
       President said, was an historical announcement of when a civil war becomes the type of action
       in which outside intervention by the United States is justified. When is a civil war not a
       civil war? Any nation ought to have the right to revolution. We recognize the right of
       revolution. We also say every people has the right of self-determination—that right of
       self-determination is one that carries with it the right not to have outside interference
       that stimulates it. We go into Lebanon because we were invited in and because here is a man,
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, who was freely elected leader in his country
       who finds his country infiltrated by corruption, subversion and bribery. In the larger sense
       the President could say we have to find a way to deal with civil <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245"
        facs="0277"/>war—if we do not, we will lose the world. The Communists have developed the
       device of foreign-inspired revolution to create a civil war (a classic case was
       Czechoslovakia). What we are doing here is saying that finally the West has reached a
       conclusion. We will not stand by to allow civil war to deliver a country even to <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Vice President further cited our action in the
       Greece–Turkey difficulty.</p>

       <head>OTHERS PRESENT</head>
       <item>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName></item>
       <item>General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName></item>
      </list>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the landing operations in
       Lebanon have gone well. The second Marine battalion will land beginning at dawn tomorrow, and
       the third one will begin landing by nightfall. The two battle groups in Germany can land
       within twelve hours, on call from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>.
       This will give us a very respectable force in the area.</p>
      <p>The President said that the United Kingdom wants to get us to commit ourselves now to
       clearing up the whole mid-East situation, and this gives him a good deal of concern. General
        <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that he and the Chiefs are strongly of
       the view that going into Lebanon was the right thing to do—otherwise we would lose our whole
       position. The President said that he too thinks it was the right thing to do, so long as the
       action rests on moral ground. If, however, our only argument is economic—saying that the life
       of the western world depends upon access to oil in the Middle East—this would be quite
       different, and quite inferior to a purpose that rests on the right to govern by consent of
       the governed. The President said he is giving deep thought to finding a moral ground on which
       to stand if we have to go further. He also referred to a question in the Congressional
       meeting yesterday—as to whether the impetus action comes solely from <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, or through him from the Soviet Union. The fact is that
       he is so small a figure, and of so little power, that he is a puppet, even though he probably
       doesn’t think so.</p>
      <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0278"/>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> next said that the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff think that they should put <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> on increased alert. He
       was in agreement on all measures except the one of deploying our tanker aircraft into forward
       positions. This would be a very major operation, and could well occasion a good deal of
       alarm. The President thought there would be merit in dispersing our tankers at the present
       time. After further consideration he said he felt we should send a few of them forward.
       General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> asked whether this could be limited
       to the continental United States, but the President said he would like to see some
       contingents sent overseas, including Great Britain. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
        >Twining</persName> said they also consider that the Air Defense Command should be put on
       increased readiness. This would not attract so much attention. The President approved this
       action.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> next referred to the two divisions
       (one Army and one Marines) which have been placed on alert in the United States for movement
       to Europe or the Mediterranean area. To proceed with loading them out would call for the Navy
       to charter vessels, and this again would give notice of an operation of major scope. Part of
       the Marine Division could be loaded on the Navy’s own transportation, but the remainder of it
       and all of the Army division (the 101st) would require chartered vessels. In addition, a part
       of the 82nd Division is ready for quick airlift to Europe if directed. The President first
       suggested keeping a careful roster of shipping that is in position to be quickly chartered,
       and used for this purpose. He agreed that if the ships were chartered now, this action would
       give alarm. He said he would like to see a study by the Chiefs as to just what would be
       involved, but recognized that anything of major proportions would create a bad psychological
       impact at this moment.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that, if orders are given now,
       the Marines could be loaded and ready to move within ten days without substantial disruption.
       The President approved this action, but told General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
        >Twining</persName> not to charter vessels for the 101st Division as yet—but rather to plan
       such an operation. He agreed that all of these units could be placed on alert, leaves
       cancelled, etc. In response to a question by the President, General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that some 400 transport aircraft could be pulled
       off <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> activity in order to move elements of the 82nd
       Division if so directed. (In checking over the foregoing with me, after leaving the
       President’s office, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> indicated that he
       would defer any chartering of ships at least until tomorrow, so as to avoid adding any impact
       from that action to the situation created by the initial landings.)</p>

      <p>401. Although my original appointment with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> had been fixed for noon (Embtel 390),<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2"><ref
         target="#d136">Document 136</ref>.</note> at request of President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> I put it off until 1:30. Obviously President did not
       wish to give time for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to stage an Army coup
       before landing of US Marines. It later developed from my conversation with General that
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had given evasive information to <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> this morning. It was not until I saw General that it
       clearly understood we contemplated landing a battalion of Marines. As I was speaking to
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, his Chief of Staff announced seven vessels
       were standing to, six miles off airport. This was 13:45 local.</p>
      <p>With an air of infinite sadness General said only thing which had saved Lebanon during
       these recent months was its Army. With arrival of US forces he could no longer be sure as to
       future conduct of that Army. He gravely feared Army would disintegrate on confessional lines.
       As for future of Lebanon he predicted it would either become a Christian Israel or would be
       inundated in the sea of Islam.</p>
      <p>When I said we fully expected complete cooperation from Lebanese military and further
       expected Lebanese Army would continue to do its duty in opposing rebellion, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> shrugged his shoulders in a tired way. He did however
       say he would continue to do his best to keep Army together.</p>
      <p>Stressing this was a purely military opinion unrelated to politics, General asked me
       urgently to prevent actual disembarkation of troops. He said “We are on the brink of
       catastrophe. There is a very thin chance we can avoid going over that brink provided your
       soldiers stay on board their ships.”</p>
      <p>I said I would ask our Army Attaché who was present to convey this professional opinion to
       commanding officer of expeditionary force. My own recommendation would be that, if compatible
       with his orders, he keep his force on board, ships be docked in Beirut port ready for
       immediate deployment. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he would have no
       objection if such small detachments of Marines as I might wish to protect US Embassy
       installations went ashore for that purpose.</p>
      <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0280"/>
      <p>Subsequent to this interview, I am informed by Naval Attaché that his messages suggesting
       coming alongside in port did not reach task force which is at 1430 disembarking troops in
       landing craft off airport. At 1500 five hundred men had been deployed at airport.<note n="3"

       operation here that views of US Ambassador re political matters are paramount.</p>
      <p>I am currently engaged in an extremely delicate endeavor to keep Lebanese Army from

       coming into port with most of his men on board were based on political considerations since
       if <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> decides to throw in sponge, Lebanese Army
       will fall apart, and one of essential elements of our intervention (that Lebanese armed
       forces continue fighting) will have disappeared.</p>
      <p>In answer to my oral message set out penultimate paragraph Embtel 401, I have received
       following message from “Gladwell” (whether brassbound man or ship not indicated) torn
       straight out of military manual: <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0281"/>

       </quote></p>
      <p>Furthermore, subsequent to despatch Embtel 402<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">In telegram 402
        from Beirut, July 15, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported that
        President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had sent word to him that he had
        received information through military sources that General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> had decided to send an armed force to arrest <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> responded that he
        would try to arrange for the despatch of a detachment of marines to help protect the palace,
        and he called <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to express astonishment at the
        report. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said that he had tried to dissuade his
        officers from attempting a coup, but he felt his arguments were weakened by the fact that
        the U.S. forces had come ashore. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> stated
        that he had warned the General “very explicitly" that the United States was undertaking the
        landing in support of the legitimate government of Lebanon and that if the Lebanese army
        arrested the chief of state “there would be most disagreeable consequences.” <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> responded that he would “recommend" that the coup
        against <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> be stopped. (Department of State,
        Central Files, 783A.00/7–1558; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> I had a direct
       oral request from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> on his secret radio channel
       to send Marines with tanks for defense of palace. I passed this on by messenger to Marine
       Colonel commanding at airport, thus far without result. This again bears upon my major
       political responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Three times this afternoon General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> or his
       chief of staff have protested that at airport Marines have told Lebanese military to pack up
       and go home. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> says his understanding was we were
       landing to cooperate with Lebanese security forces, not to take their places. This also is my
       understanding.</p>
      <p>I refer to Deptel 5093<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">Dated June 30. (Department of State,
        Central Files, 783A.00/6–3058)</note> in which it is explicitly stated that: <quote

       </quote></p>
      <p>Request immediate instructions to whoever is in command of landing forces that he must get
       in touch with me and likewise take my judgment on matters of vital political importance. I
       realize local commanders are doing their best but are bound by exceedingly rigid orders. Thus
       far Lebanese military look to me to interpret actions of our military and I have not yet even
       been able to establish contact with commanding officer almost four hours after operation
       began and apparently has been completed.</p>

      <p>217. Following is State–Defense cleared political directive to military commander being
       communicated to <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1">CINCSPECOMME</gloss> by Defense: <list>
        <item>“1. The USG has acceded to the request of the lawful Government of Lebanon that US
         military forces be dispatched temporarily to Lebanon. The purpose of this action is to
         assist the Government of Lebanon in maintaining the independence and integrity of the
         country and to ensure the protection of US life and property.</item>
        <item>2. The military measures whereby those objectives are to be attained are laid down in
         the overall military plan. Military operations will be limited to the geographical confines
         of Lebanon unless the Government of the US specifically authorizes their
         enlargement.</item>
        <item>3. Only the minimum degree of force necessary to attain the objectives should be used,
         and military tasks should be handed over to the Lebanese forces as soon as they are in a
         position to assume them. It is intended that withdrawal should take place as soon as
         practicable after the Government of Lebanon is able to fulfill unaided the purposes set out
         in para 1 above or the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has assumed the responsibilities
         now being exercised by the US. The US Government will provide further instructions when
         this stage appears to have been reached.</item>
        <item>4. This is an operation in a friendly country in support of a friendly government, and
         members of the US armed forces should act accordingly in dealing with local authorities and
         with the local population. All public relations activities should be fully consistent with
         official guidances issued by the US Government and to that end should be coordinated with
         the local US Diplomatic Representative.</item>
        <item>5. Advice on political matters relating exclusively to Lebanon should be sought from
         the US Diplomatic Representative in Beirut. To this end liaison should be maintained with
         him at all times, and he should be consulted also in regard to procedures for making any
         necessary official contacts with Lebanese political and military authorities. Through the
         local American Diplomatic Representative, the US forces landing in Lebanon should also
         establish appropriate liaison with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Observer Group in
         Lebanon. To the maximum extent compatible with their mission, the US forces should
         cooperate with <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0283"/>the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
          >UN</gloss> Observer Group and avoid any action which would impede the functioning of the
         Observer Group. Wider political issues affecting US military forces in Lebanon should be
         referred to the US Government through military channels and should such reference become
         necessary, the local Diplomatic Representative of the US should be kept fully
         informed.</item>
        <item>6. In case of difference between the military commander and the local US Diplomatic
         Representative in regard to political matters relating exclusively to Lebanon, the views of
         the latter shall be controlling.”</item>

      <p rend="center">TELEPHONE CALL TO THE PRESIDENT</p>
      <p>The Sec said <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> is coming in. The British are very
       naturally exercised about the situation in Iraq and tried yesterday through M’s talk with the
        Pres<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">See <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note> and
       through cables to get a blank check which the Sec does not think they should do but one
       suggestion was that <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> would come over to
       talk about it and the Sec is inclined to suggest to <persName corresp="#p_HVS1"
        >Hood</persName> that if they think that is desirable we would be glad to have him come. The
       Pres said that is all right. It will show what the difficulties are—we are not a
       parliamentary govt and they can’t get it through their heads. We can do a good deal on
       logistic support etc. beyond what we are now doing. All our statements today are full of
       prudence but we have laid the groundwork for showing the bad ones are in Iraq and Jordan.</p>
      <p>The Pres made the statement all right—just under 14 minutes. The Sec praised our technique
       for 1 minute to a page.</p>
      <p>The Sec referring to the above is not clear as to their strategy.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d144fn3">An hour later, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> discussed

         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s request, and “indicated the need for people

         <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Robert Murphy</persName> might be effective in addressing the
        political problems involved in the crisis. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
        added that, having taken the initial military step in the area, he hoped the United States
        would not vacillate in supporting the British where necessary in Jordan and Iraq. <persName

      <p>423. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> telephoned me at 9 this morning
       to protest intent of Marine landing force to enter Beirut. He said he could not be answerable
       for conduct of his force if they moved into the city before he had had an opportunity to
       speak with his men.</p>
      <p>On my own responsibility I requested General <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName>
       temporarily to suspend operations until I had a chance to talk to President. This General
        <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName> did. Because of communications difficulties I
       was not able to consult Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>.</p>
      <p>I called on <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> at 9:30 accompanied by General
        <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName>. President said he was seeing <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> immediately and unless General could advance more
       convincing arguments than he expected, he, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>,
       would agree to Marines carrying out their operational plan to invest port area, this
       deployment to be along avenues skirting seacoast and harbor. I concurred particularly since
       Marines will have an impressive show of force in way of armor and firepower.</p>
      <p>I suggested to President (who confirmed his continuing apprehension that Army coup d’etat
       might at anytime be launched against the palace) that rather than station Marines in palace
       itself, it would serve purpose for a detachment of armor to be stationed at my residence
       compound in the old Chancery. This would place aid within five minutes of palace and since I
       am on a 24-hour open radio hook-up with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, I
       could summon assistance in very short order. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       thought this an excellent idea and I have made arrangements with General <persName
        corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName> accordingly.</p>
      <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that unless I hear from him by 10:30
       a.m. I would request General <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName> to carry out his
       orders. As of 10:35 when this is written, movement of Marines into port area will recommence.
       Some Lebanese tanks have been moved into position on airport road on which they will pass. I
       have sent Foreign Service Officers speaking French and Arabic to assist General <persName
        corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName> in dissuading tank commanders from opening fire.</p>
      <p>Expect envelopment of port to be completed shortly after noon today. Will bring Admirals

      <p>I told General that President had learned from General <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1"
        >Wade</persName> that Lebanese artillery and tanks had taken up positions along airport road
       subsequent to <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1">Wade</persName>’s call on President. <persName

      <p>In consequence in <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s presence I suggested
       General accompany me to these new positions in order personally to make arrangements for safe
       passage of marine battalion. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had no option but
       to go along with this request. I then took General in my car out toward airport where we met
       entire column stopped by Lebanese military who had meanwhile lined up every available tank
       and recoilless rifle in Beirut with guns trained on US column.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3"

      <p>Fortunately at this juncture I met Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_YRAHA1">Yeager</persName> who had
       just arrived and together with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> we
       proceeded to nearby command school where General got in touch with his headquarters staff and
       countermanded orders which had set up Lebanese tanks and artillery in a hostile posture.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> went through an extensive telephone
       arrangement ostensibly to provide escort jeeps manned by Lebanese army to bring column into
       harbor area in platoons of three vehicles with a ten-minute interval between each segment.
       Whether by design or accident a small <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0287"/>burst of
       firing near command school gave <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> further pretext
       to hold up movement of column on grounds he wished to prevent “incidents”.</p>
      <p>By this time Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and I had impression
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was stalling. In consequence I said we would
       now move with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> to escort first segment of column to port area. With
       some reluctance <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> went along. We got first column
       well on way to port and then found main body was stalled near airport. By this time all

        >Holloway</persName> and <persName>Yaeger</persName> and I have since been doing operation

       and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> … who, characteristically, is taking the
       afternoon off at Junieh.<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">Ellipsis in the source text. <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported, in telegram 433 from Beirut, July 16,
        that the Marine battalion was fully positioned in the harbor area by afternoon, without any

      <p>135. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>, acting Foreign Minister, handed me
       at 6:15 p.m. 6-page declaration of the Soviet Government in connection developments in the

        States with “open aggression” in the Middle East creating a “serious threat to peace.” (<hi

         target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> on July 17 for the Secretary, noted that the wording of the
        statement had been exceeded in terms of gravity only by the warning issued by the Soviet
        Union in conjunction with the Suez crisis on November 5, 1956, and by the TASS statement of
        October 18, 1957, warning against an attack on Syria. Nonetheless, the <gloss
         target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> analysis concluded that the purpose of the Soviet statement
        was to deter the West from moving against the new Iraq regime rather than to foreshadow a
        forceful reaction to the U.S. intervention in Lebanon. (Memorandum from Cumming to <persName

        <p>“Soviet Government imperatively calls upon the Government of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
          >USA</gloss> to cease its armed intervention in the internal affairs of the Arab states
         and to immediately withdraw its forces from Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Government declares that the Soviet Union cannot remain passive toward events
         creating a serious threat in an area bordering on its frontiers and retains for itself the
         right to take the necessary measures dictated by the interests of preserving peace and
         security.”</p>

      <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said declaration would be published
       tomorrow. Full translation in following telegram:</p>
      <p>I merely stated that he was aware of the position of my government from the statement I had
       made to him yesterday and from the debate in the Security Council. I did, however, wish to
       point out with reference to the use in the declaration of the words “open <gloss

      <p>US in landing troops in Lebanon at request <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> has acted to
       assist in preservation independence of Lebanon and in interest safety US nationals in that

       soon as circumstances permit.</p>
      <p>Our forces thus are not on hostile mission. We seek, as we sought in 1956, to preserve the
       independence and integrity of a country which considers itself threatened from without. We
       cannot deny responding <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0291"/>to such a plea from a small
       country which turns to us for aid—aid which seems the more necessary in view of the bloody

      <p>We earnestly hope that our mission will be completed in circumstances which will have a
       minimum adverse effect upon our relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. We
       believe that government of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should understand that if US

       forces intended to clear out of Lebanon quickly. The Secretary replied that it was the U.S.
       intention to stay there. The only possibility, he said, might be that whoever was elected
       President might ask the U.S. forces to leave, say in September. If that should happen, he
       said, he did not see how the U.S. forces could remain.</p>

      <p>473. For the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. You might be
       interested to know that the AF Boeing 707 took us from Westover non-stop to Beirut in exactly
       11 hours averaging close to 500 miles an hour at an altitude of about 40, 000 feet. Pilot
       said it was minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit outside.</p>
      <p>Temperature in Beirut fortunately considerably warmer. Immediately after arrival <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> and I met with <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName>. I find a very satisfactory working relationship and understanding
       between them. They deserve credit for the skillful manner in which incidents with Lebanese
       forces were avoided yesterday, due to fact that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       had failed to persuade his military entourage of the necessity and wisdom of US military
       intervention.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> I called this afternoon
       on President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He gave me lengthy account of
       events preceding present outbreak of civil strife in Lebanon attributing his principal
       difficulties to enmity of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> for his refusal to
       reject British and French diplomatic representation after Suez. In larger field he felt
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was following Soviet policy objectives in
        <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, and although he “hoped <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> might reform” he had frank doubts.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said so long as Syria was in <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s hands, there could be no lasting peace in <gloss
        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. However for immediate crisis he thought if situation could be
       restored in Iraq, Government of Jordan stoutly maintained and Lebanese assisted in preserving
       its integrity, there would be a good chance for maintenance of general peace. If anything
       were to be done against Syria militarily, it should be done with secrecy and speed. He
       emphasized latter as being an essential element if Russians were to stay out.</p>
      <p>Most of our conversation naturally dwelt with situation in Lebanon. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was warm in his expression of thanks to President
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and yourself for swift and effective
       action by US forces.</p>
      <p>President was frank in admitting we had been very close to an ugly incident yesterday and
       was equally candid in saying that unless Lebanese Army could be divested of a small group of
       disloyal officers, our military and political enterprise here would be placed in jeopardy. He
       said he could not give a final answer as to extent to which Lebanese <pb n="263"
        xml:id="pg_263" facs="0295"/>Army would be effective in putting down revolt until he had
       settled this problem. He said he would instruct General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> tomorrow morning to remove disloyal officers in the general staff.
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> will check with President after his talk
       with General who is calling on me at 1 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
      <p>In response to my query whether elections could be held July 24, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> said answer must wait on development of events particularly purging of
       higher army staff. He said it was already clear, however, many deputies now would be
       reluctant to vote for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as President because of
       yesterday’s near-miss between Lebanese Army and Marines.</p>

      <p>To determine whether the United States should make jet fighter aircraft available to
       Lebanon and Jordan on a grant basis.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background:</hi></p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item><p><hi rend="italic">Lebanon:</hi></p>
        <p>The pro-West Government of Lebanon continues to feel insecure in its position and to look
         to the United States for economic and military aid. The Lebanese are particularly urging
         that we furnish the Lebanese Air Force with modern jet fighters to replace the obsolete
         planes with which they are presently equipped. The Lebanese believe that their possession
         of jet fighters would act as an important deterrent to the Syrians. They also stress the
         psychological effect which the provision of such fighters would have on Lebanese public
         opinion. The British have expressed an interest in Lebanon’s air strength and are
         maintaining a small air training mission in Lebanon. We have been advised by the British,
         however, that while British fighter aircraft might be made available to Lebanon, the United
         Kingdom is not in a <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0297"/>position to offer them on a
         grant basis nor even to pay a portion of the cost of these planes on the understanding that
         the United States would assume the balance.</p></item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item><p><hi rend="italic">Jordan:</hi></p>
        <p>Since his accession to the throne in 1953, King Hussein, himself a trained pilot, has
         exhibited a strong interest in the strengthening of Jordan’s Air Force which presently
         consists of about 36 planes, of which 12 are obsolescent British jets. While the
         Anglo-Jordanian Treaty was still in force, King Hussein constantly sought British
         assistance in this connection, but relatively little was done. About a month ago, the King
         advised the British Ambassador in Amman of his desire to purchase a number of the latest
         type of British fighters. The British have accordingly provided considerable information as
         to availabilities. Just recently a representative of the British aircraft firm of Hunter
         has been in Amman and has awakened the King’s interest in acquiring 16 Hunter Mark VI
         fighter aircraft at a total cost of about $7 million. Not unexpectedly, the Jordanians have
         approached us as to the possibility of our assisting Jordan in financing this
         transaction.</p></item>
      </list>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basic Considerations:</hi></p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>The Department of Defense states that it has no military requirements for aircraft to
        be supplied to either Lebanon or Jordan. However, Military Assistance Program funds can be
        made available for this purpose if the transaction is of sufficient importance to warrant
        the diversion of funds from other military assistance programs because of overriding
        political considerations.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Defense further states that if a political decision is made to supply these aircraft,
        there are more than adequate numbers of United States F–86 jet fighters available
        immediately at less than half the cost of the Hawker Hunter. However, Defense will not
        object to the supply of British aircraft and recommends the Hawker Hunter as the best choice
        among British aircraft for this purpose.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>Although it would be cheaper to provide American fighter aircraft such as the F–86, we
        feel that considerations arising from the Arab-Israel dispute and our past refusal to supply
        United States jet aircraft to Israel would make it preferable for us to avoid placing United
        States aircraft in either Lebanon or Jordan. Aircraft from a friendly Western power would
        seem to be preferable and Britain is apparently willing to assume the political risks
        involved.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Political considerations applying to both Lebanon and Jordan are so similar that it
        seems clear that we could not decide to supply the planes to just one of these two
        countries. If we made the planes available to Lebanon, it would be almost impossible for us
        to justify a negative response to the Jordanian request, and vice versa. From the economic
        viewpoint, the major difference is that once planes were <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
         facs="0298"/>made available on a grant basis to Lebanon, there would be some prospect that
        Lebanon could bear the recurring costs of their maintenance. These costs, so far as Jordan
        is concerned, would have to be absorbed by a budget which is already being supported
        primarily by the United States. These recurring costs are estimated at $1 million annually
        for maintenance and operation of 12 aircraft of the Hawker Hunter type.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>The total cost of a program of 12 Hawker Hunter Mark VI’s for Jordan and 6 for Lebanon
        is estimated at between $5 and $6 million. This includes an allowance for adequate spares
        and ground servicing equipment. Procurement would be under standard MAP procedures rather
        than through financing a commercial transaction as requested by Jordan.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>While the International Cooperation Administration has stated that it has no direct
        substantive responsibility in this matter or reason to object to the proposed provision of
        jet aircraft, attention was called to the fact that continuing costs associated with
        military build-up carry with it a probable requirement for future military assistance and/or
        defense support from the United States, though not of major magnitude.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>Admittedly, the provision of aircraft to countries which request them primarily for
        reasons of prestige is a costly business and a risky one so far as its global implications
        are concerned. The heavy pressures to which these two small pro-Western countries are being
        submitted, however, incline us to the belief that we should be prepared to do something by
        way of an affirmative and sympathetic gesture. Both Governments have assumed considerable
        local and international political risks in maintaining a pro-Western position, and we
        believe they should be sustained and encouraged by us. We believe that these considerations
        are overriding and that we should give a favorable response to their requests in this
        instance. Specifically, we believe we should agree to supply 6 Hawker Hunter Mark VI’s to
        Lebanon and 12 to Jordan.</item>

       meetings less likely be interrupted. Following are highlights our conversation lasting over
       two hours: <list>
        <label>(A)</label>
        <item>King Hussein, deeply concerned, believes that while “real" federation Egyptian-Syrian
         unlikely some kind “paper unity” will be announced shortly which would put propaganda
         initiative for Arab unity in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s hands, make
         Jordan’s position precarious since even “paper federation” would have tremendous appeal
         throughout Arab world especially among west bank refugees.</item>
        <label>(B)</label>
        <item>Rifai basically differs with King in that he regards Egyptian-Syrian link-up as a <hi
          rend="italic">possibility</hi> whereas King believes it immediate definite <hi

        <label>(C)</label>
        <item>Following several conferences between King and Rifai latter convinced of imminent
         danger propaganda victory through paper federation required immediate action. At King’s
         direction Rifai prepared plan in effort counter Egyptian-Syrian federation move.</item>
        <label>(D)</label>
        <item>Plan drafted by Rifai which King accepted is based on revival treaties friendship and
         brotherhood between Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia which permit great latitude economic,
         military integration without surrendering any sovereignty as would be required in either
         federation or confederation. Rifai intends explain plan along following lines. Inasmuch as
         treaties have been in force more than ten years and already renewed for additional periods
         five-ten years plan cannot be called response to or in competition with the Egyptian-Syrian
         proposal but rather as the next logical step toward greater unity among Arab states sharing
         common borders. Furthermore since Egypt, Syria now under Soviet domination Jordan, Iraq,
         Saudi Arabia as only logical remaining defenders holy places Mecca, Medina are faced choice
         either join opposing <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0301"/>power bloc (Baghdad Pact) or
         seek common front among independent Arab states, continue work for Arab unity, provide only
         defense Arab world against further Israeli aggressions.</item>

      <p>Rifai volunteered opinion British would not object too strongly if Jordan liquidated
       providing this were price of working their way back into Egypt and by making full use of
        <persName corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName> Said and his clique into Iraq and eventually
       other parts <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. He said <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss>
       had intelligence information indicating British are willing make considerable concessions
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in exchange more liberal Egyptian policy
       toward British interests. Rifai became quite excited and said in light creation <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and serious threat it held for Jordan and King Hussein in
       particular <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> must quickly assess its position and determine
       who her friends are. In an impassioned voice he said while British, US interests are mutually
       compatible in Europe they tend to fragment in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> where we seem
       to be in competition with one another. He therefore wished to know USG position in view
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName>’s statements.</p>
      <p>I replied that despite fact I had been informed by British Embassy officer of certain
       common conclusions reached at Ankara I had as yet received no specific directive other than
       the general policy that my government was favorably disposed to all efforts toward Arab unity
       providing they represented the will of the people and governments involved. I gave as my
       personal opinion that it would be most difficult for any country to publicly oppose <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or to deny it recognition although the latter might be delayed
       pending outcome proposed plebiscite. I reminded both Hussein and Rifai that my government had
        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0304"/>demonstrated its friendship for Jordan in a most
       tangible way and as far as I knew had no intention alter its present policy which was based
       on a willingness work with our Arab friends wherever and whenever possible. I suggested that
       it would be helpful if Hussein could give me outline any specific plans create and Arab
       organization to counter the effect of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">9 paragraphs (11/2 pages of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>I expressed my appreciation to both Hussein, Rifai for information they had provided and
       said I would appreciate knowing what they envisioned as role to be played by the US in
       present situation.</p>
      <p>At Hussein’s direction Rifai asked me transmit following request to US: <list>
        <label>(A)</label>
        <item>Public support by USG for the new organization of Arab States as proposed by
         Hussein;</item>
        <label>(B)</label>

       </list></p>
      <p>I immediately pointed out to both Hussein, Rifai that on the surface this seemed to
       represent a considerable upward revision in the amount of US aid and I felt would require
       considerable study Washington.</p>

      <p>Embassy comment follows.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">The Embassy’s comment followed in
        telegram 1436 from Amman, February 4. The thrust of the comment was that the Saudi response
        to Hussein’s proposal cast doubt over the prospect of a federation of the three Arab states,
        and Hussein’s suspicion of British motives indicated an increasing conviction that
        U.S.-British interest were incompatible in Jordan. The Embassy concluded that Jordanian
        anxieties were rooted in a fear that Jordan could not survive a “popular” call for Arab
        unity unless Hussein’s federation proposal was adopted. (Department of State, Central Files,

        <item>Question of Iraq’s relationship Baghdad Pact is of course one for Iraq to decide. In

         There is nothing inconsistent between Iraq’s membership in Baghdad Pact and fulfillment of

       cause it difficulties in its formative stage.</p>

      <p>1553. Complex problems in US–Jordan relations posed by announcement Arab Federation<note
        n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">On February 14, Iraq and Jordan announced the formation of an Arab
        Federation with King <persName corresp="#p_FII1">Faisal II</persName> of Iraq as Chief of
        State and King Hussein of Jordan as his Deputy. The announcement, which was signed by the
        two Kings at Amman after 2 days of meetings, indicated that each King would retain
        constitutional authority in his own kingdom, the federal capital would rotate between
        Baghdad and Amman every 6 months, a federal legislature would be established, but two
        regional councils would exist to deal with non-federal matters, and a constitution would be
        enacted within 3 months to implement the announced federation.</note> are made subject
       following preliminary country team assessment. Underlying most conclusions reached below is
       belied that US–free world interests dictate support of this western-orientated federation
       which, while obviously requiring time prove successful, eventually likely play important role
       in any future Arab grouping.</p>

      <list>
       <item>A. Jordanian attitudes.</item>
       <item>Despite initial enthusiasm Jordanian officialdom, full implications Jordan-Iraqi action
        not yet realized by most. Emotional appeal momentarily has brushed aside awareness of
        difficulties ahead in process implementation. Future sacrifices by vested interests only
        vaguely understood.</item>
       <item>General Jordanian reactions still difficult define in precise terms. While reception
        favorable particularly on east bank, there remains sizeable frustrated elements on both
        banks incline reject federation as mere gimmick designed block “real” Arab unity through
         <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Much potential negativism tempered however by
        expectations of economic gain for Jordan with result that large portion population appears
        willing wait and watch developments. Public demonstrations of enthusiasm have been obviously
        lacking in spontaneity and conviction. But failure of announcement to elicit full popular
        acclaim does not detract from <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> over-all evaluation that
        pressures against King and government, which received added strength through declaration
         <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, have now subsided greatly. <gloss target="#t_CT1"
         >CT</gloss> believes it safe assume that <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> has passed at
        least temporarily from year-long “holding operation” into stage of greater stability.
        However, changes in martial law rule not expected until stability becomes more demonstrably
        permanent.</item>
       <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0309"/>
       <item>B. Initial implications for US.</item>
      </list>
      <p>Past record Arab states of rising above local considerations has not been such as to
       inspire faith in their ability produce more than paper results, e.g., Arab League and
       multilateral treaties. Jordan no exception to this record, but apparent increased local
       awareness of present international political circumstances provide basis for <gloss
        target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> optimism that selfish interests can be subordinated to larger
       considerations of unity provided US lends full support to maintenance of momentum generated
       by federation announcement.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> expects even during period preceding promulgation new
       constitution many pressures will be generated through painful process of relinquishment
       sovereignty. If unchecked these pressures could vitiate true effectiveness of federal
       authority by creation of supranational body incapable of directing national policies.
       Indications of such tendencies have been observed already in King Hussein, Rifai, army and
       others, although these attitudes are partially tied in with maintenance of bargaining
       position for Jordan.</p>
      <p>It may be expected that schedule for initial steps implementing agreement will conform in
       general with that outlined by Rifai, reported Embtel 1507. Request for recognition therefore
       likely early May. But before this stage is reached <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> believes
       that well-formulated political decisions by US will be necessary in order to provide needed
       impetus to federation. Perhaps certain appropriate indications of US plans prior to May could
       serve to check tendencies “have cake and eat it too”.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> envisages basically uncompromising positions on some
       sovereignty issues which would seem require early formulation by US of policy most likely to
       enhance position federal authority even at expense wounding royal prides. By taking such
       action <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> believes US can begin laying ground for its eventual
       disengagement from direct participation Jordanian politico-economic scene and still exert
       constructive influence on federation. However, premature attempts at such disengagement, in
        <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> opinion, can spell only failure of Arab Federation.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Economic</hi></p>
      <p>A. General considerations.</p>
      <p>Much of US support must continue to be provided in terms economic and military needs of
       area without undue emphasis being given at this time on potential capacity Iraq to assist
       Jordan.</p>
      <p>Economic integration is likely to proceed slowly and any indications prospective losses in
       public or private sectors will tend retard implementation. Ministry of Finance and some
       businessmen already advocating go-slow attitude in view interests considered threatened by
        <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0310"/>Iraqi competition. However, these interests not
       significant in total picture since with few exceptions Jordanians should eventually profit
       economically from federation.</p>
      <p>Certain early developments must be expected if any progress to be made. Among these would
       be (1) abolition trade barriers and (2) free mobility capital and labor.</p>
      <p>Governmental expenditures in Jordan will continue dependent US and other aid. British
       attitude development aid and <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> debt repayment to <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> likely to become less generous owing favorable Iraqi financial
       situation. Especially in view growing Jordanian suspicions British motives, effort should be
       made encourage full British recognition Jordan’s continued need for <gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss> economic assistance in context latter’s support of federation.</p>
      <p>B. US aid program.</p>
      <p>In order bolster federal authority <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> believes basic US aid
       relationships should be established soon as possible on centralized basis with new federal
       government. Since Jordanian officials still do not know how operations will be carried out or
       what will be completely unified it’s still too early to foresee best method of operation and
       organization. Some difficulties precluding current assessment are: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Communications;</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Extent to which Jordanian and Iraqi Governments will consolidate functions, e.g.,
         Minister of Economy expecting consolidation and seeking immediate action before his
         authority curtailed; Minister of Agriculture expects no unification agricultural
         operations; Ministry of Health anticipates some sort federal advisory health service in
         future but expects no direct authority from federal government over his administration of
         health program for Jordan.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In order to produce successful transition in operation US aid program care must be taken to
       allay fear that Jordan will become economically neglected province of Baghdad’s empire.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Military</hi></p>
      <p>Jordanian army views federation project with studied caution but no lack of agreement in
       principle that higher joint staff headed by Iraqi general will be created. Belief is that
       under this command Iraqi and Jordanian armies will operate as separate forces and that
       details for complete integration will not be completed before 1960. At present Jordanians
       expect stipulation in agreement concerning previous international commitments will “protect”
       Jordan from association <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> or BP whereas US aid to Jordan
       would continue be channeled through “Jordan” army.</p>
      <p>Many Jordanian analyses of army unification suffer from close examination particularly
       since it is clear that problems of logistics and administration have received only casual
       study to date. Integration of <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>Iraqi officers into
       Jordanian army must be done on larger scale than contemplated now using their greater
       experience and rank; schooling of officers must be standardized; budgeting and programming of
       funds will have to be maintained by central authority to be successful; promotions and pay
       rates must be standardized; and many prior international agreements so intimately affect army
       operations that Jordan will be required adhere to them in spite of present reservations.</p>

       <head>SUBJECT</head>
       <item>Budgetary Support for Jordan</item>
      </list>
      <p>I refer to your memorandum of February 28, 1958<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">Not printed.
         (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> in which you question the necessity of continuing
       budgetary support for Jordan under the Mutual Security Program in the light of the recently
       announced agreement of federation between Iraq and Jordan. Specifically, you ask whether it
       is in the interest of the United States and within the intent of Congress to use Mutual
       Security Funds to help maintain governmental operations and services in Jordan, which has now
       become part of a federal state whose total resources appear to be adequate for the purpose.
       We believe it is in our interest to continue budgetary support for Jordan. The following are
       the principal considerations bringing us to this conclusion: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><p><hi rend="italic">United States Interests in Iraq–Jordan Merger:</hi> We believe
          that the federation between Iraq and Jordan is potentially a significant and favorable
          development with respect to United States interests in the Middle East. Properly
          implemented and executed, this federation can make a substantial contribution to area
          stability and economic development and should have a favorable effect on both long and
          short term problems now facing us in the area. For example, it could help check Soviet
          penetration and eliminate or lessen the effect of some of <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280"
           facs="0312"/>the elements of instability in Jordan. Therefore, it is in our interest that
          the federation be successful and that we support and assist it to the greatest possible
          extent.</p>
         <p>In our approach to it at the present time, however, we must remain aware that, while the
          federation has been proposed, it has not been formally established and, while we have no
          doubt that the February 14 proclamation will be implemented, it would be premature to
          formulate policies on the assumption that actual federation has been established. Our
          separate commitments to Iraq and Jordan are, therefore, still fully in effect and must be
          considered to be so until formal federation gives us a basis for taking a new look at the
          situation. Further, our desire to see federation successfully implemented makes it
          desirable to continue to demonstrate, in discussions of the future, a keen United States
          interest and desire to render assistance to Jordan and Iraq under whatever new political
          arrangement they may make.</p></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Past United States Assurances:</hi> Prior to the February 14
          federation agreement, we had given assurances to both the Iraqis and Jordanians of our
          continuing desire to assist Jordan (Deptels 1294 and 1309 to Amman<note n="3"
           xml:id="d162fn3">Neither printed.</note> and Deptel 1989 to Baghdad<note n="4"
           xml:id="d162fn4">In telegram 1989 to Baghdad, February 1, the Department conveyed
           assurances to the Iraqi Government that the United States remained interested in the
           stability and integrity of Jordan and would continue to give sympathetic consideration to
           the requirements of the Jordanian Government for economic assistance. (Department of
           State, Central Files, 885.0087/1–2258)</note>). On February 13, we sent Deptel 1919 to
           Amman,<note n="5" xml:id="d162fn5"><ref target="#d160">Document 160</ref>.</note>
          expressing our favorable view of the proposed federation and stating that the United
          States was prepared, subject to constitutional requirements and the availability of funds,
          to consider how it could best assist in strengthening the association, with particular
          reference to the needs of Jordan. This, plus subsequent telegrams dealing with technical
          aspects of our assistance program in Jordan, has conveyed to both the Iraqis and
          Jordanians the clear, and correct, impression that we support the Federation proposal and
          to aid in its success we wished to continue economic and financial assistance to
          Jordan.</p>
         <p>An indication now that the United States sought to terminate its financial assistance to
          Jordan would not only be considered by the Iraqis and the Jordanians to be a breach of
          faith but might also cause the Iraqis to reconsider their role in the new
         federation.</p></item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Implementation of the Federation Agreement:</hi> The February 14
         agreement stipulated that a new constitution would be drafted for the federation and that
         the necessary measures for setting up a federal government would be taken within three
         months. It has already become apparent that there will be considerable difficulty in
         working out <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0313"/>specific details of the merger,
         particularly in the government organization and economic spheres. We believe the Iraqis
         should be more forthcoming in the field of financial and economic assistance to Jordan, and
         will urge in the strongest terms that they be so, but we must recognize that we can not
         expect the Iraqis to agree to a one-sided arrangement whereby Jordan obtains great economic
         advantages at Iraq’s expense while Iraq, by the nature of Jordan’s economic position, can
         expect almost none. While it is too early to forecast the final terms of the economic
         aspects of the federation, we are reasonably sure that they will fall far short of Iraq’s
         immediately assuming responsibility for Jordan’s budget. We do not think it practicable to
         attempt to influence these terms radically now, but rather that we should work toward a
         gradual assumption of Jordan’s financial burden by Iraq.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Iraq’s Economic Needs:</hi> While Iraq’s economy is far stronger
         than Jordan’s, substantial uncommitted Iraqi funds are not available for budgetary
         assistance to Jordan. In the first place, Iraq is not expected to recover from the
         financial losses suffered as a result of the sabotage of the oil pipe lines in Syria until
         some time during the second quarter of this year and has, in fact, incurred an indebtedness
         of around $80 million as a result of loans from the Iraq Petroleum Company during 1957. Its
         ordinary budgets for the past two fiscal years have shown deficits which were financed by
         these <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> loans and a deficit of ID 3.8 million ($10.6
         million) is expected in Iraq’s fiscal year 1959. In the second place, 70 percent of Iraq’s
         oil income is earmarked for an economic development program which authorizes expenditures
         of over $1 billion during the four year period April 1957 through March 1961. Any delay in
         the realization of the economic benefits of this program would seriously impair a promising
         long-term possibility for ultimate drifts of population from overcrowded Jordan to Iraq.
         Therefore, it would be unwise both politically and economically to urge a reduction in this
         development program. As you know, one of the reasons for our grant military assistance to
         Iraq is to permit Iraq to strengthen its defenses, and to contribute actively to collective
         defenses within the Baghdad Pact without diverting funds from its development program.
         Therefore, although we believe that Iraq can contribute more to the support of Jordan’s
         budget than it has in the past and we will continue to urge it to do so, we do not think it
         will be possible to discontinue or reduce United States budgetary assistance to Jordan
         during the coming Jordan fiscal year. In fact, we may well have to face <pb n="282"
          xml:id="pg_282" facs="0314"/>a more serious budget support problem than in the past year,
         since indications are that Saudi Arabia’s financial situation is forcing a serious
         reconsideration of its aid to Jordan.</item>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Related to this is the further question:</hi> How can the United States

       States interests in the area?</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">The Problem:</hi></p>
      <p>The long-range threat of the United Arab Republic to take over neighboring Arab states is
       considered to be contrary to the interests of the United States in the area. The most likely
       challenge to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s advance in the area would be a
       strong and successful federation of Iraq and Jordan. The Arab Union, however, has little
       broadbased appeal within Iraq and Jordan and plays a definite “second fiddle" to <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in other areas of the Arab world. The Governments of
       Jordan and Iraq rest mainly on force and are regarded with cynicism and suspicion by all but
       a small minority in each country. While the United States believes it to be in its interest
       to support the Arab Union, there are <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0315"/>disadvantages
       to a close identification of the United States with the regional and internal political
       policies of the Arab Union and its component governments.</p>
      <p>The popularity of any Arab government among the politically conscientious sectors of the
       population is determined mainly by the degree to which that government: (a) avoids dependence
       upon Western European nations; (b) supports issues of importance to the Arab world; (c)
       opposes excessive internal corruption, and (d) fosters economic and social reforms. The
       chances of increasing the popularity of the Governments of Iraq and Jordan are, however,
       further handicapped by a basic cynicism toward government itself, which exists in both these
       countries as a holdover from Ottoman times. Furthermore, both present regimes in these
       countries suffer from their own past association with the mandate period.</p>
      <p>The Iraq Government enjoys little popular support because it is considered to be still in
       control of those who depend on Western support for their strength and because little appears
       to be done to oppose traditional and excessive corruption. Recent efforts to gain popularity
       by the extreme espousal of Arab views on Palestine and Algeria have been of little help. Only
       in the field of economic progress is the present Iraq Government gaining any popular
       support.</p>
      <p>King Hussein of Jordan, by his dismissal of Glubb,<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">General John
        Bagot Glubb was dismissed by King Hussein as Commander of Jordan’s Arab Legion in
        1955.</note> his unquestioned courage and will to rule, and his continuing firm stand
       against Israel, enjoys some popularity. His government, however, is also considered corrupt
       and has been able to gain little support through economic activity.</p>
      <p>Popularity in itself in this part of the world is not necessarily an essential element for
       the survival of a government. Popularity has proved in the past to be a fickle thing and
       moves made solely to gain popularity may not contribute to stability. No government in the
       area, however, can afford to be completely unresponsive to public opinion for any extended
       period of time. Even the strongest governments seek means of assuring, on occasion, waves of
       public acclaim.</p>
      <p>In pure theory, a number of possible courses of action are open to the Arab Union as means
       of gaining more support within Iraq and Jordan and some measure of support externally.</p>
      <p>The withdrawal of Iraq from the Baghdad Pact, the abrogation of Iraq’s special agreement
       with the United Kingdom, or Iraq’s withdrawal from the sterling area are examples of action
       which might serve to erase to some extent the impression of excessive dependence upon the
       West.</p>
      <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0316"/>
      <p>In the field of Arab issues, Iraq and Jordan might recognize a separate Arab state on the
       West Bank under refugee control, although the loss of the West Bank could be a serious
       psychological blow to the Union. The Arab Union might seek action in the United Nations to
       reaffirm the 1947 resolutions or might promote joint action with Saudi Arabia in blocking the
       Gulf of Aqaba. These governments might seek to strengthen their hands by efforts to undermine
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s control of Syria. On the more positive side,
       the Arab Union might seek more actively over the next few months to obtain the adherence of
       Saudi Arabia and possibly Kuwait and Bahrein to the Arab Union.</p>
      <p>Internally, there are in pure theory a number of actions which the Iraq or Jordan
       Governments might take to strengthen their popular appeal. They might agree to conduct
       genuine free elections or agree to the sincere sponsorship of tax and land reform laws. Iraq
       might resume its anti-corruption campaign (instead, the new <persName corresp="#p_alSN1"
        >Nuri</persName> Government is reviewing previous dismissals for corruptions). <persName
        corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName> and Rifai might retire and provide an opportunity for new
       faces in the Government.</p>
      <p>In the economic field, the Iraq development program is already having some positive appeal,
       although much remains to be done to create genuine public confidence in its efforts. If this
       enlightened concept with its essentially non-political character could be extended to Jordan
       and the Union as a whole, it would undoubtedly help the stability and support for the
       Union.</p>
      <p>Given these various possible courses of action by which the Arab Union might seek to gain
       wider popular support, the possible role of the United States is extremely limited. Any
       support or encouragement on our part for extreme moves of the type which might give the Iraq,
       Jordan or Union Government some public acclaim would probably not be in our broader
       interests.</p>
      <p>In the internal field, any effort by us to encourage directly the type of political reforms
       with which we might be sympathetic and which might create a more popular government would run
       the grave risks of being considered interference in internal affairs and of undermining the
       strong governments which now provide stability. Once the present restraints on political life
       are removed, it is not at all uncertain [<hi rend="italic">certain?</hi>] that the result
       would be favorable to the United States.</p>
      <p>Concern over the possibility of being charged with intervention in internal affairs,
       however, need not prevent us completely from seeking opportunities to provide advice to these
       governments. We do this with some degree of success on a daily basis through our Point IV
       programs. We can find frequent opportunities as we comment to these governments on new
       developments in their Union. The chances, however, of their accepting or appreciating advice,
       which might require a fundamental change in their thinking or in their social order, are
       extremely limited.</p>
      <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0317"/>
      <p>The internal security in these countries remains an important element. It is always
       possible that a long period of internal stability, accompanied by some economic improvement,
       can create a preference for and a vested interest in stability which can have a marked and
       beneficial effect on the long-range development of the country. We can continue to support
       the stability of the present regime by assistance to the armed forces and the security
       forces, although it may not be long before the saturation point for such assistance is
       reached.</p>
      <p>The economic field appears to provide the best possibility for a constructive United States
       role in strengthening the Arab Union and its component parts. The Union, itself, would
       probably be strengthened and the United States could assume a more appropriate role if Iraq
       could be induced to assume responsibility for budgetary support for Jordan. The United States
       might then assist the Arab Union or its components on specific development projects.
       Assistance to the Union in the economic field would avoid our involvement in internal
       political matters and provide the least risk to our wider position in the area.</p>
      <p>In addition, we can remain alert to opportunities to assist in establishing new or
       alternative methods of petroleum transit which would give greater insurance to Iraq’s
       economy.</p>
      <p>The ultimate success of the Arab Union will also depend to a considerable extent on the
       degree to which satisfactory relations can be established with the other Arab states, and
       particularly with the United Arab Republic. The Arab Union has, undoubtedly, been handicapped
       by the bellicose and unrealistic policy which <persName corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName>
       has pursued toward the United Arab Republic. We recognize that it may be difficult to advise
       leaders of the Arab Union to pursue correct relations with the United Arab Republic in view
       of the past history of their relations and the very real fear that the United Arab Republic
       represents a threat to their ultimate existence. We nevertheless believe, if opportunities
       arise, it is important that we and the British advise leaders of the Arab Union against
       continued public opposition to the United Arab Republic, and, to such an extent as may be
       possible, encourage them to establish correct diplomatic relations as a minimum.</p>

      <p>2488.1) We believe it to be in US interests and in those of AU that AU, largely through its
       own efforts, become true union and evolve into meaningful constructive entity responsive in
       important respects to wishes of its people. Approach by <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss>
       and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to practical problems involved in implementing Union
       should therefore be positive in terms of establishing sound foundation state which will
       constitute new constructive influence in area. In our view Union has very little chance of
        <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0319"/>success if sole or most important motivation is to
       establish counterpoise to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and if component parts continue
       go own separate ways on important problems. In practical terms, foregoing means that any move
       proposed by Iraq or Jordan in connection with Union should be weighed in terms of whether it
       contributes in fact as well as in appearance to accomplishment meaningful Union.</p>
      <p>2) We are concerned by recent reports from Amman and Baghdad which give impression some
       members governing group still thinking more in terms preserving national and personal
       prerogatives than in terms making concessions necessary to effective implementation Union. We
       recognize important concessions made heretofore, particularly by King Hussein, and realize it
       natural individuals should not wish surrender perquisites and prestige attached to present
       positions. Seems evident, however, such feelings must give way to pressing need endow Union
       government with attributes and authority customary in federal state.</p>
      <p>We have also noted tendency count on outside assistance, either from US, <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or Kuwait, to accomplish what must in essence be responsibility
       of Arab Union Government. There appears to be too much emphasis on what must be done by
       outsiders to assure success of Union and insufficient emphasis on actions which Iraqis and
       Jordanians themselves must take. Finally, we sense undesirable inclination evade basic
       problems such as financial situation which will face AU as well as <gloss target="#t_HKJ1"
        >HKJ</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> Governments, and problems involved in
       determining precise international status.</p>
      <p>3) Foregoing leads us consider whether we and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should not
       take more active role in pressing for immediate consideration important problems facing Union
       and in providing appropriate guidance in solution these problems. We recognize need avoid
       giving impression we are sponsoring or directing specific proposals, our association with
       which might prejudice position <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> and <gloss
        target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and invite charge we were endeavoring force Union on reluctant
       government and people, as well as need avoid being maneuvered into position where major
       financial assistance requested and expected of us. In any discussions this question we
       believe it is essential however stress first of all importance for Iraq and Jordan of making
       Union a going concern and our conviction Union will succeed if <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
        >GOI</gloss> and GOJ want it to.</p>
      <p>4) Coordinated comments Amman and Baghdad requested on foregoing.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d164fn2">The Embassy in Amman responded, in telegram 1912, May 9, that it agreed
        with the overall assessment of the circumstances facing the Arab Union, but added that, in
        many important respects, the United States considered the success of the union to be more
        important than most Jordanians did. It was necessary, the Embassy felt, to avoid any action
        which would reveal that disparity, such as attempts at direct guidance, in that such action
        could lead to demands for material assistance beyond what the United States was prepared to
        contemplate. The Embassy suggested that the correct approach to the new union would be for
        the United States and the United Kingdom to treat it in all important respects as a single
        entity, in order to underwrite the integrity and prospects for success of the union. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 786.00/5–958) The Embassy in Baghdad also agreed with the
        Department’s general analysis of developments affecting prospects for the union between Iraq
        and Jordan, and echoed the Embassy in Amman’s emphasis on the importance of encouraging a
        genuine union capable of developing inherent strength. (Telegram 1843 from Baghdad, May 9;

        bypass an active role in the Arab Union Cabinet for the position of Prime Minister of the

         indicated that his decision to refuse the post of Prime Minister/Foreign Minister in the

         down the effective integration of the two states in light of what he viewed as Iraqi
         reluctance to modify a number of the economic and foreign policy issues on which there were
         differences of opinion between Amman and Baghdad. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> Both

        the Embassy reported that a note dated May 19 had been received from the Jordanian Ministry

        policy structure for the Arab Union. (Department of State, Central Files,
        786.00/5–2058)</note> creates serious doubts in our minds that Union will in fact have
       international status required for recognition as new state. Apparent lack of intention
       establish functioning AU governmental authority at early date also creates problem from point
       of view immediate recognition. Apparent unwillingness <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and
        <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> leaders make concessions necessary to establishment real
       Union will in our judgment enable enemies of Union without <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289"

       security and welfare of both Iraq and Jordan can be best assured through establishment strong

       e.g. February 14 declaration, if Iraq and Jordan now do not carry through their political
       position in the area will be seriously damaged.</p>

       existed between us and is prompted by our very real concern over what we fear may be
       consequences of failure establish Arab Union as constructive entity in Middle East. Further
       point out that, assuming AU found to possess legal qualifications for recognition as state,
       we assume diplomatic relations would properly be conducted only with duly constituted AU
       Ministry Foreign Affairs, not with local governments as Rifai proposes. We also assume
       international agreements would be concluded only with AU Government through which US economic
       and military assistance should be channeled.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">Chargé <persName

        <p>As a result of this discussion, we are able to inform you that, in addition to the
         substantial support already given by the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to the
         Jordan Government, the US Government will, subject to Congressional authority, make
         available to the Arab Union up to $25 million to meet the whole of the Jordanian share of
         the Union budget for the period July 1, 1958–March 31, 1959 in replacement of budgetary
         assistance to Jordan. Since Jordan’s share of the Union budget is estimated at $18.75
         million, there could be available up to $6.25 million to help meet the deficit on the Iraqi
         side. For their part, the United Kingdom Government will make a contribution of up to the
         equivalent of $4 million to the Union budget. These maximum figures are based on the
         presently available estimates of the Union budget, and on the assumption that the Union
         will become operative on July 1st.</p>
        <p>We hope that this assistance will enable the Union Government to surmount the
         difficulties of this first period, and give an opportunity which you can use to work out
         more permanent arrangements.</p>

        <p>In view fact AU assuming responsibility for military and foreign affairs portions
         Jordanian budget and since US plans make contribution to cover Jordanian share AU budget,
         this procedure will replace direct US budgetary support to Jordan. However, untransferred
         remaining $7.5 million of $15 million already obligated to Jordan remains obligated for use
         in Jordan in manner to be mutually determined. Above is convincing evidence our support for

      <p>2260. Although final outcome Lebanese rebellion unknown all indications point best we can
       expect is neutral Lebanon in place former pro-western government with definite possibility
       country may come under <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> domination. My opinion time has
       come consider politico/economic effects such change will have on Jordan. Present <gloss
        target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> pro-western government headed Prime Minister Rifai lacks
       popular support, is maintained in power only through imposition martial law carried out by
       army/security forces loyal King Hussein. Both Hussein/RIFAI reluctant yield more than minimum
       sovereignty AU, fear they might lose direct control those forces protect own political
       interests. For same reason Rifai refuses delegate authority, operates virtually as dictator
       with every branch Jordanian Government under his personal control. Result, while his ability
       respected, alienation other government officials including certain number cabinet virtually
       complete. Mutual interdependence Hussein Rifai and latter’s astuteness protecting Jordan’s
       interests information of AU plus his demonstrated ability secure substantial US
       economic/military aid provides raison d’être his power. Since sudden death either Hussein or
       Rifai which is definite possibility would shatter present power structure, question arises
       what prospect continuance pro-Western policies by successor government. Unfortunately my

      <p>In event either Hussein/RIFAI or both should be killed who would be able form new

        <item>He confirmed number army officers ranging in rank from Cadet to Colonel have been
         arrested in connection plot assassinate King Hussein, Rifai, other pro-western officials.
         Rifai said investigation continues, possibility total number arrests may reach 40 or more.
         In answer my question if conspirators have previous record disloyalty he replied several
         lower rank known to have been on fringe 1957 attempt dethrone Hussein but never apprehended
         because government felt they lacked necessary leadership. I asked if conspirators had
         penetrated higher echelons army including General Staff. Rifai replied this possible but
         not yet definitely established. His opinion even if some general officers implicated this
         not important as if regimental commanders involved. So far investigation has produced no
         evidence field commanders above company grade officers implicated. Rifai expressed
         confidence government could deal effectively with situation but admitted Beni Khalid tribe
         which straddles Jordan/Syrian border now providing communication channel for conspirators
         with former Jordan military who fled to Syria last year. Rifai added this further evidence

       Rifai expects his brother will arrive Washington during first week August. He said this will
       enable him (RIFAI) keep Jordan needs, views before US officials much better than in past. I
       remarked that his brother would not be representing Jordan alone but AU whereupon Rifai
       launched into a long dissertation on just how he expected relations between US/Jordan be
       conducted. In essence both he and Hussein apparently are going to insist that all matters
       directly affecting Jordan are to be handled through whatever US representation located Amman
       with communication being addressed to AU Foreign Minister but actually delivered, processed
       through Khususy Khairy’s office as Minister State Foreign Affairs with Rifai making all but

        military attaché political direction of conspiracy comes from outside army and undoubtedly
        from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, probably through Colonel Serra in Syria. There
        does not yet appear to be organization in Jordan capable of carrying out a coup d’etat on

        opposition elements by arrest, curfew, censorship and other Draconian means has paid off to

      <p>I have just read a telegram saying that the King of Jordan has specifically asked for an
       assurance both from your Government and from ours, that we will come to his assistance
       militarily if he thinks this necessary to preserve the integrity and independence of Jordan.
       I very much hope that you will agree that we ought both to give this assurance at once. But I
       think it would be to our advantage not to let the situation drift, as it has done in the
       Lebanon. We ought, in my opinion, to urge the King to make his request at once, since if our
       military support is to be effective and have a real impact upon the whole situation in the
       Middle East, it will have to be given promptly. Moreover, we ought to act before disorder
       develops, and while we can be sure that the airfields are in friendly hands. If we are asked
       to send British forces, we should use for this purpose the forces now earmarked for the
       Lebanon. It would help us to know what forces you would be able to make available. Here
       again, we should have to deal with the United Nations, and all the public presentation, on
       the same lines as for the Lebanon. There has been an attempt to subvert the Jordanian Army
       and the revolution in Iraq is clearly fostered and supported from Cairo.</p>
      <p>2. I should be grateful to have your views urgently. I hope you will feel with me that this
       action is the necessary complement to what is proposed for the Lebanon.</p>

      <p>There was some discussion of the urgent need for the United States forces in Lebanon to
       have a political adviser attached to the Commander. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName

       to think Julius Holmes should be spared from his imminent duties as Assistant Secretary and
       agreed that while the officer chosen should have appropriately high rank, Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>’s position must be preserved.</p>
      <p>Lengthy discussion of King Hussein’s request for assurance of U.S. and U.K. support, and of
       British importunities that we join in giving this assurance (the Prime Minister’s message to

       mount and sustain the dispatch of military forces to Iraq without military or at least
       logistical as well as financial assistance from us was in serious question. The Secretary
       concluded that for the moment only an interim holding reply to Hussein could be sent (he
       signed the telegram),<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4"><ref target="#d176"><hi rend="italic"

       affirmatively to <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>’s offer to come to
       Washington to discuss the Iraq and Jordan situations.</p>
      <p>The Secretary felt that if the French inquire about <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName>’s coming they could be told that it is only to discuss Iraq and Jordan and

      <p>The Secretary said that it was not clear to him from the British messages we had seen how
       the British thought the problem of Jordan and Iraq should be played and what were their
       concepts and plans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> had indicated he
       might be able to come to Washington. If there were time, the Secretary thought this would be
       a good idea and he said that the President was agreeable. Lord Hood replied he believed
       London’s belief that unless something were done quickly in Jordan and Iraq, it would be too
       late. To this the Secretary agreed and added that there was a great absence of information.
       It was clear the landing in Lebanon today had had a good effect but the big question was
       Iraq. Whoever came over from London should come over <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0338"
       />if and when he was ready to discuss this problem seriously and perhaps he should bring some
       technical people with him. We had thought about many contingencies but the Iraq development
       was a new one. We had sent a brief holding message to King Hussein<note n="2"
        xml:id="d177fn2"><ref target="#d176"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> but had no
       clear idea as yet on the desirability of putting troops into Jordan. We were studying these
       problems and would try to be ready by Thursday.<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">July 17.</note>
       The Secretary said we might probably want to have a working party on this subject, which
       perhaps should be set up in London, but first the top people should determine what was to be
       done. The Secretary said that he could probably make all day Thursday available and part of
       Friday morning for meetings with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>. Friday
       afternoon he would be taken up by Mutual Security hearings on the hill.</p>

       <item>Bloody events which have taken place in Baghdad have, no doubt, greatly distressed free
        world. The legitimate head of state and the Government of Iraq, our ally within BP, have
        been overthrown as result of revolt of some army elements working for foreign powers, namely
        Egypt and Communist world. Thus, this situation which is result of external subversive
        activities, has created conditions which are seriously injurious to both Iraq and AU, our
        friend and ally. As result of this revolt, jointly prepared by Nasserism and Communism, the
        vital interests and security of regional members of BP, namely, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan,
        have been seriously shaken and breached and security and stability of entire free world has
        now been more exposed to danger of Communism.</item>
       <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0339"/>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>As is known, following tragic events which have taken place in Iraq, King Hussein has
        assumed powers of legal head of state of AU in accord with constitution, and has requested
        powers accredited to AU not to extend official recognition to the rebels who have taken
        control of Baghdad and to address all communications to Amman.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>Bloody and inhuman acts perpetrated in Baghdad following annexation of Syria and
        rebellion initiated in Lebanon are clear indication of extent of the aggressive policy
        pursued by Nasserism acting in unison with Communism. In fact, instigations of Egypt among
        Kurds in region through <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> encouragement, which have been
        undertaken even before attempts at subjugating Iraq, prove clearly that true objectives of
        both <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and international Communist are to create
        common frontiers between Soviet Russia and Egypt, in other words, to place entire <gloss
         target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> under Soviet domination.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>In fact, regional pacts among which figures BP covering our region have been
        established with the support, and later, the physical participation of US, because of
        designs of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to dominate <gloss target="#t_ME1"
         >ME</gloss> coupled with inability of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to ensure fully
        security of its members as a result of Soviet veto.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>It is again for same reason that, following the Canal incident, US has proclaimed
         <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine which has been gratefully
        welcomed. Following Syrian events, and uprisings in Lebanon, bloody incidents in Baghdad are
        now taking place in our region which we believe is being defended against Soviet
        infiltration and subversive activities by BP on one hand and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine on other.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, allies of US and aligned with free world, are following
        above events and are intently watching whether <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine will operate in this instance or not. For, action taken by
        US in order preserve AU and Lebanon’s independence and territorial integrity which are at
        present jeopardized because of above-mentioned subversive activities, will not only indicate
        a measure of the guarantee of our own defense, in event it should become necessary, but also
        to such proportionate extent would cause either increase or decrease of audacity of Soviet
        Union and its partner <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</item>
      </list>
      <p>For this reason, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan deem it necessary to state that, following
       gratifying decision taken by their friend and ally US, in order safeguard independence and
       territorial integrity of Lebanon, the implementation of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine in case of the Iraqi-Jordanian Union’s situation is of vital
       importance for them.</p>
      <p>At same time, all three countries stand ready to support with all means at their disposal
       decisions to be taken by the US for preservation of independence and territorial integrity of
       AU, as well as these already taken by US in case of Lebanon, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, <pb
        n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0340"/>urge US to proceed with utmost vigor to take all such
       measures which may be considered necessary in light of such situations which may arise.</p>

       Representative.]</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then went on to say that the Jordanian
       situation is rapidly becoming extremely dangerous. We have information of a <pb n="309"
        xml:id="pg_309" facs="0341"/>planned attack against King Hussein on July seventeenth.<note
        n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">Two reports were received on July 16 indicating that <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had instructed his agents in Jordan to assassinate
        Hussein and overthrow the Jordanian Government on July 16 or 17. (Telegrams 47 and 54 from
        Tel Aviv, July 16; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 785.00/7–1658) Secretary <persName
         corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> characterized this intelligence as important in a
        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> on the morning of July
        16, and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> indicated that a flash warning
        had been sent to King Hussein. (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, General Telephone
        Conversations; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> A severe petrol shortage
       exists, because the Jordanians are not getting their normal supplies from Iraq, and have no
       storage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said we are studying the airlift
       of packaged <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, but are unsure whether we will get Saudi
       Arabian clearance to fly it in from that direction. We will plan to use the Aqaba base, but
       this will be slow in developing. The suggestion was made of obtaining <gloss target="#t_POL1"
        >POL</gloss> for Jordan from Israel; he said this would be very dangerous, and would have to
       be approached most carefully. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
       suggested that Israel might turn it over to the United States or United Kingdom who in turn
       could convey it to Jordan.</p>
      <p>The President said he is concerned that, if the Armed Forces we are supporting in the area
       are unreliable and seditious, we really seem to have nothing on which to base our action. He
       emphasized the need for one or more good radio stations in the area. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> suggested setting up a “black Iraqi” radio in Turkey.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> thought a short-wave station could be
       opened in Jordan, and that it might be possible to move the <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
        >USIA</gloss> radio ship up to Beirut. The President stressed the need to identify ourselves
       in the area with nationalism. We need to get some clever and convincing people from the
       populations and to carry the message that their progress lies in association with the West.
        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said he would get some of his people to
       work on this.</p>
      <p>The President referred to a report from a Senator earlier in the day that the Voice of
       America had sought a statement from him, and might well be seeking statements from others
       opposing the President’s action. He thought this was very unwise and asked Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to look into the matter. He stressed that he
       feels the Voice of America should be used to put out our official story.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> informed the group that <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> would be arriving the following day; the question
       was whether the situation in Jordan would hold until his arrival.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of support for Iran and Turkey.]</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that if there is any military
       action contemplated with respect to Jordan, either by ourselves or the British, the Defense
       Department needs to be advised. The President said he knew of no basis on which we could move
       in, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought we should wait to see what
       the British are doing, and talk to <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>. <pb
        n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0342"/>The President commented that the British may be
       planning to move in light of the threat to Hussein. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said this intelligence came from the British who gave a digest of it to
       Hussein. He said he assumed the British would go in by air, and Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> confirmed this, adding that they will need logistic
       reports from us. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> thought the British
       should get their forces in at once, but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said he had no enthusiasm for British forces going in. Lebanon has not
       been swept by pan-Arabism, but in Jordan and Iraq, pan-Arabism could sweep the country very
       quickly. To his question as to whether Jordan would welcome the British, <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> thought there were ties going back to the old Arab
       Legion which would tend to create a good relationship, even though the legion has been
       scattered. (At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MWBJ1">Macomber</persName> and Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> joined the group.)</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next took up the point as to
       whether we should press Hussein to make a call for the British to come in. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> thought we should not do so. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that if any troops were sent in they should be
       British, although we might provide air logistical support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
        >Allen Dulles</persName> wondered if we could send a couple of planes into Amman from
       Dhahran so as to be able to pick up the King if that should be necessary. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> agreed to make this arrangement.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d179fn3">At 11:05 p.m. on July 16, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
         >Burke</persName>, Chief of Naval Operations, cabled the Commander of the Sixth Fleet:
        “Stand by to evacuate King Hussein from Amman with two COD planes and appropriate air
        cover.” (<gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss> telegram 29527 to COMSIXFLT, July 16; National
        Archives and Records Administration, RG 218, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Files;
        included in the microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>The President said that the strategic action in the circumstances would be to turn Israel
       loose on Egypt, thus going for the head of the snake. This did not seem possible, however. He
       thought we should strengthen Turkey and Iran but did not feel we could send our troops
       further than Lebanon. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that if
       Iraq were to drop out of the Baghdad Pact, he thought there would be good reason for our
       joining. It would be premature to do this today, but the action should be considered
       soon.</p>

      <p>132. Rome for McSweeney. McSweeney pass to CINCSOUTH. At 1900 hours local time King Hussein
       summoned British Charge Mason, myself to Palace where in presence Prime Minister Rifai he
       announced “in view critical situation facing Jordan as result Lebanese crisis, rebellion in
       Iraq and on basis information obtained from most reliable sources that <gloss

       information I knew had been provided from American sources or was there other evidence

        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> agents had penetrated not only bank refugee camps but also
       considerable portion East Jordan, that they had responsive groups within security forces
       including Army who in all probability would not “fire on their brothers” once mob action
       began. Mason said his information fixed date of coup as July 16/17. Rifai added as result
       arrest important Communist leader yesterday <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> had uncovered
       subversive network geared to Syrian and Iraqi apparatus which had definite plans attempt
       uprising using civilians as instigators, relying on emotional influence Iraqi revolt

       security forces, prevent outside subversive elements from taking over country. [<hi

      <p>I pointed out time factor made it unlikely US troops could be positioned Jordan for at
       least 24 hours even if all requirements their dispatch be expedited soonest. Hussein said “we
       need them now, can’t your Sixth Fleet fly them in as British propose to do from Cyprus?” I
       said my opinion we were intruding into military field, suggested Mason/myself could serve
       best by processing Hussein request to Washington/London as quickly as possible since that is
       where decision must be made. Hussein said he has summoned Parliament into night session in
       order advise them his decision. Expressed determination make Jordan “freedom fortress Middle

       <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“The United States Government supports the action of the Government of the United Kingdom
         in responding affirmatively to the urgent appeal of Jordan for assistance in the defense of
         Jordan’s independence and integrity. The United States believes that this is a justified

          Spokesman, the Department sent a circular of the announcement to the principal posts in

       </quote></p>
      <p>In the course of drafting the statement, there was considerable discussion of the final
       sentence. The Secretary said, in discussing the “inherent right of nations to call for
       assistance,” he was thinking of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d186fn3">See <ref target="#d106fn4">footnote 4, Document 106</ref>.</note> He said
       other arrangements by which the U.S. had troops in foreign countries were not reported to the
       United Nations, although generally the bilateral agreement on which the arrangements were
       based were reported to the United Nations. In emphasizing the threat to Jordan in the
       statement, he said he was conscious of the possibility of Soviet troops being sent to Syria
       at the request of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and wanted to differentiate between
       action taken when a nation was threatened and that taken when there was no threat.<note n="4"

        Jordan in response to a request from the King of Jordan. U.S. Representative <persName
         corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> expressed strong support for U.K. military assistance
        to Jordan, which he said pointed up the need for the United Nations to cope with the serious
        problem of indirect aggression in the area. Texts of these statements are printed in <hi

         considered the urgent need for increased fuel supplies for Jordan. (Memoranda of

      <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> on the
       assistance the U.S. was prepared to render to British forces in Jordan the Secretary of State
       confirmed that the U.S. was prepared to provide logistic assistance. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he did not expect to provide U.S. operational help
       unless the situation developed to a critical point. He said he was not immediately inclined
       to favor a combined operation but that if the Jordan operation should require further
       operational assistance the U.S. would study the possibility with an open mind.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that the United States
       recognized the dangers in the positions in both Lebanon and Jordan. Lebanon, he said, had the
       advantage of a large group of Christians who welcomed U.S. intervention. In Jordan, however,
       the mass of people were not loyal to the King and if the refugees were turned loose the
       problem would be particularly difficult. It would be a serious matter if the British forces
       were required to shoot the refugees or other civilians.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said that the British by going into
       Jordan had put themselves in an extremely vulnerable position. He said he would feel much
       more certain of the security of the British position if the United States also had troops in
       Jordan. While the public position adopted by the United States and the logistic support
       demonstrates U.S. support for the British action, the success of this enterprise as a
       deterrent to <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0352"/>further <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> interference in Jordan might be greater if U.S. troops were also in the
       country. He added that he was not however authorized to request U.S. participation at the
       moment.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that he doubted the presence of U.S. troops would materially alter the
       course of events. He said that at the moment the United States was inhibited because he had
       told Congress that the U.S. did not intend to put troops anywhere but in Lebanon. If the
       presence of U.S. troops would do good, however, the Secretary said he was willing to consider
       it.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said it was important to avoid any
       appearance of division between the U.S. and the U.K. on this matter. Marshal Dickson pointed
       out that Jordan had also asked the United States for help.</p>
      <p>The Secretary promised to think further about the matter.</p>

      <p>The Secretary reported on the progress of his conversations with Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">United Nations</hi>—The Secretary said he and Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> had agreed that the United Kingdom and Jordan should
       make a statement in the Security Council with respect to the British response to King
       Hussein’s request for military assistance but they hoped that it would not be necessary to
       table a resolution and thus avoid a debate with Egypt.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated matters.]</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said he had
       been asked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> to say how very grateful
       they were for U.S. support with respect to Jordan. The Secretary had given something to the
       press, we were to make a statement in the Security Council, and our experts were looking <pb
        n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0353"/>into the problem of logistical support. This was all to
       the good but the British Government would be particularly happy if the Jordanian exercise
       could be a truly joint operation. This would in effect make it a kind of deterrent. The
       President pointed out that we did not have the advantages of a parliamentary form of
       government and that our operation in the Mediterranean had been presented as being limited to
       Lebanon. We would surely stand shoulder to shoulder with the British but as in the Torch
        Operation<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">Reference is to the Allied invasion of North Africa in
        1942.</note> there were occasions when it was well to have a division of effort. There was a
       brief discussion of the progress of the British troop movement into Amman, concerning which
       information was very meager, as well as regarding the plot against King Hussein. The
       Secretary reported that he had been called at 2 a.m. because the Israeli insisted that we
       support the British request for overflight commission. He had agreed to this but the timing
       has been very late.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said the British were putting 2200
       paratroopers into Amman and the Guards Brigade would be behind. They did not want to put in
       too many forces because of the supply problem which had to be carried out by air.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated matters.]</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>—At the end of the meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> again raised with the President British hopes that there might be a U.S.
       participation in Jordan. The President gave him no encouragement but said that we would of
       course not permit the British to get into a jam there.</p>

       commitments. Contrasted our attitude with British who had “rushed to our side in moment of
       peril.” In response I reminded him rather forcefully of very substantial economic
       [garble—and?] military support already given Jordan totaling approximately $50 million and
       our pledge provide $25 million additional pay in full Jordan’s share AU budget. I pointed out
       heavy concentration US land/sea/air power in Lebanon other nearby countries effectively
       guaranteed Jordan from external attack. Seemed to me placing additional token force within
       country would therefore not appreciably increase its defensive capability. Rifai in fit of
       anger shouted “King and I are not concerned with outside aggression, it is the psychological
       effect of having only British troops in Jordan that we wish to offset.” I replied that if
       this were the case, why hadn’t the danger been perceived before the request was made for
        US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention.</p>

       loyalty under close surveillance. [<hi rend="italic">13½ lines of source text not
        declassified</hi>] I told Rifai in view what he had already said I would appreciate frank
       answers following questions: <list>
        <label>(A)</label>
        <item>Had arrival British troops materially changed internal security picture? He replied we
         intend use foreign troops keep things under control when Hussein reorganizes Jordan army
         into attack force marches into Iraq restore rightful government.</item>
        <label>(B)</label>
        <item>How many US troops does Hussein expect, what role are they intended play maintenance
         internal security? Rifai indicated aside from performing occupation duty they would “take
         sting out of presence British troops in Jordan”.</item>
        <label>(C)</label>
        <item>On basis preliminary public reaction had arrival British forces created any new
         problems for present regime? Rifai admitted latent hostility “mandate days" now emerging
         with considerable evidence many Jordanians fear once British get back they will never
         depart. This connection Rifai said American troops required otherwise Jordan Army could not
         be sent fight against Iraq leaving only British in Jordan since do so would invite charge
         from anti-government groups that Hussein/RIFAI trying “pick British chestnuts out of Iraq
         fire”.</item>
        <label>(D)</label>
        <item>I said in other words if disorders broke out and American troops were stationed in
         Jordan there is a distinct possibility they might be called upon to shoot down Arab
         civilians. Rifai admitted this possible [<hi rend="italic">11/2 lines of source text not

       </list></p>
      <p>I ventured opinion this type duty not suitable combat troops expressed doubt my government
       would be willing use members its armed forces in any such home guard function. Rifai insisted
       American troops needed flavor foreign contingent although admitting difficult to justify
       their presence on anything but psychological basis. My meeting with King Hussein was similar
       that with Rifai except King was appreciative compliments paid him by USG. [<hi rend="italic"
        >41/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">211/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] It seems to me in
       light adverse reaction presence British troops USG should concentrate on humanitarian side in

      <p>496. From <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. After witnessing landing this
       morning of additional marine contingent at Yellow Beach <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
        >McClintock</persName> and I had thorough discussion all aspects situation with Admirals
        <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BVACR1"
        >Brown</persName>. I can assure Department excellent coordination is established between
       Embassy and military command. <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> could not be
       more cooperative and understanding. He expresses complete confidence in <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> whose advice he seeks.</p>
      <p>Ambassador and I then called upon Osseiran, President of Parliament. I vigorously contested
       misstatements of fact in his message to press and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> as well
       as his own private assumption that Lebanon Parliament is sole representative of Lebanese
       people. I pointed out US Government had responded to an appeal from the duly constituted
       government and President of Lebanon for friendly aid. It was invidious for Osseiran to charge
       President of US with having violated Lebanon’s <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0359"
       />sovereignty by our landing of troops when we had acted only in response to an appeal from
       the constitutionally responsible authorities in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>All Osseiran could summon as an answer was that he thought most of Parliament was against
       our landing and that in any case Lebanese Government should have consulted Parliament before
       it requested US intervention. I expressed respect for his opinion but said I understood this
       as his personal opinion rather than that of the Parliament. We pointed out for record that
       present Lebanese Government enjoys a vote of confidence from all of Parliament; that Cabinet
       by a unanimous vote on June 16 authorized <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to
       ask for friendly military assistance; and that we had responded accordingly. I urged that he
       qualify his message to President and retract the charge that there has been a violation of
       Lebanese sovereignty.</p>
      <p>Because of other appointments Osseiran’s lengthy review of situation had to be suspended
       but he is calling on me at 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>We next called on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName>, who gave a
       lengthy review of how <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in particular and
       pro-western elements in Lebanon in general had arrived at their present crisis. <persName
        corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> in our presence gave a directive for a message which
        <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> should file with <gloss target="#t_SC1"
        >SC</gloss> setting forth constitutional right of Lebanese Government to ask for our landing
       here. He ridiculed the Osseiran charge of violation of Lebanon sovereignty.</p>
      <p>At one p.m. I received General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. He gave me a
       frankly oriental expose of Lebanese politics and of his concept of Lebanese army role in
       keeping Moslem and Christian factions from fighting one another. General was frank to admit
       there had been extensive intervention from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and for first
       time in <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>’s experience, gave details of how
       in past few days direction of revolt comes from Damascus. (<persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> has also given us Arabic text of telephonic intercepts<note n="2"
        xml:id="d192fn2">Not found.</note> showing that Damascus is giving direct orders in clear to
        <persName>Saeb Calaam</persName> and other rebel leaders in the Basta.)</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was in complete ignorance of US
       resolution filed with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">See <ref
         target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.</note> saying that opposition elements had told him they
       hoped US forces could withdraw from Lebanon in favor of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       police force. I told General this is exactly what our resolution meant. <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said this would be of utmost use to him not only with
       opposition leaders but in enlightening his own troops. We suggested he pass word to
       opposition that they should get in touch with their Syrian-Egyptian-Russian clients to
       forestall a Soviet veto on our resolution. I doubt if this will have any effect on <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; it has already had effect on <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and will, I think, have effect on Lebanon military.</p>
      <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0360"/>
      <p>I am glad to report that liaison arrangements between General <persName corresp="#p_WBGSS1"
        >Wade</persName> of Marine Corps and General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       are progressing satisfactorily. Wade has informed Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName> that all of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s military
       advice has been sound. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> told us he was now sure
       his officers and men would cooperate with US forces and proposed on his own initiative he
       arrange a social reception between his staff and <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName>’s staff.</p>
      <p>Last night we had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> possibility
       of removing certain traitorous officers from <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
       “état-major.” This morning <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> told <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> he had discussed this with <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> who swore he would undertake personal responsibility for
       future conduct of all his officers. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> himself
       suggested advisability of going slow on grounds that a rapid removal of general staff would
       be expedited by enemy propaganda as under American instigation. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> told me incident day before yesterday<note n="4" xml:id="d192fn4">See
         <ref target="#d147">Document 147</ref>.</note> did not reflect a conspiracy but was a
       “spontaneous movement” with confidence of some Christian officers but motivated largely by
       Moslems who were quite prepared to die at their guns as a symbolic gesture of defiance. He
       insisted, however, this was now a flash-in-the-pan and that future there would be no
       recurrences of such in subordination. (Fact is <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       himself did not know how far his staff and subordinates had gone in preparation to fire on
       American column. First he knew was when <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>
       requested him—Embtel 428<note n="5" xml:id="d192fn5"><ref target="#d147">Document
        147</ref>.</note> —to go out to the guns.)</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he wished very much US units could be
       accompanied by Lebanon units and gave every appearance sincerity in saying there would be
       complete cooperation with our military. As a sign of progress, he did not flinch when we told
       him an army battle group would arrive by air tomorrow.</p>
      <p>We pressed him for action quelling revolt, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       was not optimistic. Prime Minister had asked me to intervene with General to crush resistance
       in the Basta by indigenous means. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s reply was a
       shrug of the shoulders and a long disquisition on how his army would disintegrate if he used
       violent means against the rebels. It was clear this General contemplates no decisive military
       action and looks hopefully for some internal political solution.</p>

      <p>Events moved so quickly yesterday that I had no time to communicate with you, but it was
       immensely heartening to have two conversations with Foster.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">See
         <ref target="#d182">Documents 182</ref> and <ref target="#d184">184</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>I only wish that it had been possible to defer the decision about Jordan until after the
       Foreign Secretary had had his talks in Washington. Clearly this is a situation in which we
       ought ideally to have had a proper joint long-term plan before embarking on any operations.
       And of course, as Foster rightly said in his message, it is not really Jordan but Iraq which
       is the real problem. Furthermore I very much dislike from the military point of view the sort
       of operation to which we are now committed in Jordan, where our troops will have no port, no
       heavy arms, and no real mobility. Without your help our logistic support passing over a
       country at least nominally neutral would be tenuous. If the gamble with the Jordan army does
       not come off, our troops will indeed be in a difficult position. Despite these difficulties I
       believe that you agreed with me that in the face of King Hussein’s appeal and the plots which
       we knew would otherwise be sprung in Jordan today, it seemed to us even more dangerous to do
       nothing than to try the operation on which we are now engaged. My great consolation is that
       we are together in these two operations in Lebanon and Jordan. We must at all costs not be
       divided now when we have been forced to play for such high stakes. I am sure that Foster and
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn</persName> will be able to work out together a joint
       plan for the future. Now that we have started on this difficult road, I do not see how we can
       withdraw until we have somehow restored stability and strength, in at least some areas of the
       Middle East. If we hesitate now, we shall indeed get the worst of all worlds, but what we do
       will require the most searching and careful weighing.</p>
      <p>I am certainly not despondent. I refuse to believe that our close and intimate cooperation
       together will not in the end produce the results for which we both hope.</p>

        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn</persName> have had useful talks and I believe that our
       thinking on common problems is identical. Our operations seem to be satisfactorily
       coordinated. I recognize that your decision as regards Jordan was a very close and difficult
       one. We have of course fully supported your decision.</p>
      <p>What the immediate future will bring we cannot tell. We can however face it together with
       the consciousness, I believe, that we have responded in a manner befitting our traditions.
       Whatever happens in Iraq and other parts of the area, we must, I think, not only try to
       bolster up both loyalties and the military and economic strength of Lebanon and Jordan, we
       must also, and this seems to me even more important, see that the Persian Gulf area stays
       within the Western orbit. The Kuwait–Dhahran–Abadan areas become extremely important and
       Turkey and Iran have become more important. We shall seek ways to help them be sturdy allies,
       first in quality and second in quantity, insofar as that quantity can be usefully provided
       and maintained.</p>
      <p>Pakistan is important but the fears of India compel some caution in the extent of giving
       more military help there.</p>
      <p>One factor that has helped to create for us the serious Mid East problem has been the
       Western inability to counteract or effectively neutralize the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> propaganda in that region. Of course, we cannot match his extreme
       positions. We cannot, like the Russians, support anti-Israel propaganda nor can we, like the
       Russians, support programs for confiscating the oil properties and the like. These are themes
       which appeal to the Arab masses and seem to win for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> the enthusiastic, even idolatrous, support of the largely illiterate
       populations in the region.</p>
      <p>We shall, however, have to try to do a better propaganda job than we have done up until
       now. Particularly we should be able to do so in regions where the particular theme of extreme
       Pan Arabism and anti-Israelism does not carry much weight, and where more emphasis can be put
       upon nationalism which, in fact, Soviet Communism tries to destroy.</p>
      <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0363"/>
      <p>Of course, the foundation for all that we do is understanding here at home. I am struggling
       hard these days to overcome the reluctance of Congress to appropriate money for information
       programs and mutual security costs and the economic development of the less developed
       nations.</p>
      <p>The problems are immense and we are not free of danger. We can, I think, however, recognize
       that the danger is not here <hi rend="italic">because</hi> of what we have done. What we have
       done has made apparent and overt a danger <hi rend="italic">that was always there</hi>.</p>
      <p>Let us together face these dangers with such wisdom as the Lord gave us to bring about a

      <p>On July 18, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Security Council considered the

       measures, including the contribution and use of contingents, as may be necessary to protect

        (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>) Lodge followed with a statement noting that the Soviet Union
       had effectively frustrated the Security Council’s efforts to respond to the crisis, and he
       introduced a resolution calling for an emergency session of the General Assembly to consider
       the Lebanese complaint of aggression by the United Arab Republic. (<gloss target="#t_USUN1"

      <p>The Sec and the Pres discussed changes in the statement the Pres will make to the men in
        Lebanon.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">On July 19, the President recorded a message which was
        broadcast to U.S. forces in Lebanon over Armed Forces Radio on July 19 and July 20. The
        message assured the troops of support for their mission of “helping the Lebanese people to

       not looking on this as a long-term operation. Our rationale was that this was not going to
       help but would prevent our friends from losing faith in us. Now the problem is to get out.
       Murphy is talking about getting out. If the Br feel we are deserting them in Jordan we may
       have to send a small token force to Jordan so as to show we are not abandoning the Br. We
       have to give logistic support anyway. The <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> is bad because
       the Saudis won’t let us fly over it. The Sec explained how the Br situation in Jordan is
       different. We are hooked for 30–40 million a year to pay the budget deficit of Jordan—the Sec
       would rather <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or the Soviets do that. The thing
       we want to preserve is that Persian Gulf position the Pres spoke of.</p>

      <p>528. Eyes only Secretary from Murphy. Here follows my very preliminary assessment of the
       political situation in which we seem to find ourselves. This is after what so far is a
       successful military intervention in Lebanon—successful in that it has worked smoothly, our
       forces and equipment are ashore and not a shot has been fired.</p>
      <p>The local political result is dubious. During the two days I have been here I have
       discovered among other things that (1) <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has been
       a self-constituted prisoner in his residence for 67 days. He has apparently not dared to look
       out of the window of his house during that period. (2) Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> was opposed to our compliance with <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s request for military support even after the events in
       Baghdad, so far as it related to Lebanon alone (last paragraph Embtel 366).<note n="2"
        xml:id="d197fn2"><ref target="#d125">Document 125</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>Taken in isolation our military operation here obviously does not provide a solution of the
       political problem weighing upon us in the Middle East. The mere presence of our forces in a
       small coastal portion of the country seems to have brought no fundamental change in the local
       political climate.</p>
      <p>It might be assumed that the availability of our forces would relieve the pressure on the
       Lebanese security personnel thus giving them a free hand in suppressing the insurrection now
       in its third month. There is no indication that this is the case. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>, the commanding officer of both the military and internal security
       forces, in reply to our pressing questions asserts that the bitter factional split among his
       personnel prevents even energetic action to clean up the city of Beirut much less the country
       at large.</p>
      <p>My initial reading of the local situation leads to the preliminary conclusion that it is in
       our interest to promote a solution of the immediate and major Lebanese political problem,
       i.e. the election of a new president. We should use whatever influence we can bring to bear
       under present circumstances to ensure parliament’s meeting next Thursday for that purpose.
       This would be in consonance with the Lebanese constitution. There will be criticism because
       it occurs in the shadow of our military operation. Alternative procedures could generate
       worse criticism. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would serve the balance of his
       term ending September 23.</p>
      <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0366"/>
      <p>It is my belief election of the new president will bring about relaxation in the country
       with the prospect of cessation or reduction for the present of rebel activity.</p>
      <p>If this assessment is reasonably accurate we are then left with the problem of what to do
       with our forces. Locally it would be possible to claim their mission had been successful. If
       calm is restored there could be gradual withdrawal. <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>
       could remain if not replaced by a more substantial <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       force.</p>
      <p>But the larger area problem would not have been solved. I have no knowledge of results of
       your talks with <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>. I do not know what action in
       Iraq and Jordan is contemplated or whether Damascus and Cairo will be left to generate
       further disturbances here or elsewhere. It is fairly evident that unless the <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> movement is checked at its source our withdrawal may
       even give added impetus to it. No doubt our military intervention has exercised a sobering
       effect throughout the area. But unless it is followed by a reversal of the area trend that
       effect may rapidly dissipate.</p>
      <p>Thus I come to the primitive conclusion that the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> element must be either destroyed or an accommodation with it developed. I
       know that this conclusion does not add to your fund of knowledge.</p>

      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> then read another message which he had
       received several days before from President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.
       After conveying his deep thanks for U.S. military assistance, the President made three basic
       points.</p>
      <list>

       <item>Neither Lebanon nor Jordan could remain independent unless the combined onslaught of
        Nasserism and Communism were dealt with now.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>The talk of a holding operation in Lebanon and Jordan saps the moral energy of those
        who would like to see a general cleaning up in the Middle East.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>There is the impression that the U.S. is in a hurry to turn over the responsibility for
        guarding Lebanon’s independence to the “dubiously adequate” ability of the <gloss
         target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If this is the intention of the U.S. it would be better if U.S.
        forces had not come in in the first place.</item>
      </list>
      <p>The Secretary asked what President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would like
       to have us do. The President had made no specific suggestion, said Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, but some of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName>’s personal ideas were that we should support King Hussein to the hilt,
       that we should put 20, 000 troops in Lebanon and 20, 000 troops in Jordan, that we should see
       what Turkey can do in Syria and Iraq, if this can be confined to local operations, and that
       there should be a strong warning to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that when we responded to the request of the Lebanese Government we did
       not think of this as a commitment to root out Nasserism and Communism from the Middle East.
       We thought of it as responding to a call for help from a small nation threatened in the face
       of events in Iraq. We did not go into Lebanon to deal with Nasserism and Communism. Had
       President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> told us that he wanted us to come in
       for this purpose, we would not have given an affirmative response. It was now disconcerting
       to be told that it would be better not to have gone in at all if we were not ready to expand
       the operation.</p>
      <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0368"/>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> presumed that President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was being honest. The President believed that Lebanon,
       even with the presence of U.S. forces, could not be protected against Nasserism and
       Communism. The President was of course deeply grateful for what the U.S. had done.</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented that it was legitimate to discuss the future, but not in terms that
       unless we went to war with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> we should not have gone into Lebanon. We do not believe in
       preventive war. The only way to deal with the basic problems in the Middle East without
       resorting to global war is by handling them with patience, piecemeal. He believed that
       Lebanese independence could be preserved, if the Lebanese wanted to preserve it, through an
       increased <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence and a gradual U.S. withdrawal over a
       period of months. A <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mantle should be cast over Lebanon.
       There was no use in talking in grandiose terms about uprooting Communism and Nasserism. This
       was something we were not prepared to go to war to do. It was better to hope for a peaceful
       solution than to solve matters by nuclear warfare. Frankly, we did not contemplate using
       Lebanon as a base for general war in the Middle East. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> said that the Lebanese Government never believed that the U.S. had any
       such idea.</p>
      <p>The conversation then turned to the prospect of election in Lebanon. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> believed that it would not be possible to hold these on
       July 24 because of the tense atmosphere. He thought they should be held before September 23,
       however.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> inquired who would decide whether the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had established adequate measures to protect Lebanese
       independence and, therefore, US forces could be withdrawn. The Secretary said that the
       decision would rest with the U.S. and Lebanon, not with Hammarskjold or anybody else. It
       would be a derogation of Lebanese and American sovereignty for anybody to try to force U.S.
       troops out of Lebanon if Lebanon and the U.S. did not desire this. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that if there could be an understanding between the
       U.S. and Lebanon on this point, the Lebanese Government would not object to the Japanese
       resolution in the Security Council.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">See <ref target="#d195"
         >Document 195</ref>.</note> The measures taken by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       must really be adequate to preserve the independence of Lebanon. The Secretary agreed.</p>

      <p>530. From Murphy. I called on <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning
       with <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>. The President had previously
       received Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BVACR1">Brown</persName> and had given him his
       military recommendations based on his intelligence there had been increased infiltration from
       Syria in recent days. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> told Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_BVACR1">Brown</persName> priority objectives in military reduction of rebellion
       were in following order: (1) Tripoli (2) Baalbek (3) Rashayar. He did not include Basta
       section of Beirut or the Chouf in this military appreciation.</p>
      <p>President said he had no particular worries now that US forces were installed in Beirut,
       however, as had I, he had received indications there might be increased terrorist activity
       directed from outside.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he now felt stronger vis-à-vis <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> because of presence of American forces. He had asked
       General this morning to prepare a plan of operation—or some prompt military result. I told
       President I had to speak frankly. With American forces in Beirut if there were any incidents,
       as for example terrorism or attacks from the Basta, they would have very serious
       consequences. These would be good neither for Lebanese nor ourselves. I therefore wanted to
       impress very firmly on President need for prompt and effective action by the Lebanese
       military. I regretted however that my impression of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> yesterday were [<hi rend="italic">was</hi>] that he intended to do
       nothing. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said if <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> did not act he would then consider removing him and appointing a new
       commander. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> said he has heard similar talk
       over the past 2 months with no result. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> replied
       situation now was different with US forces landed.</p>
      <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s visit to Damascus <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had no hard information. He said he expected by this
       evening through listening to radio and telephonic communications to be able to formulate a
       better judgment as to what significance of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
       visit in Syria might be.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had no information re Iraq.</p>
      <p>I mentioned my conversations yesterday with President of Parliament Osseiran (Embtel
        496)<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2"><ref target="#d192">Document 192</ref>.</note> and my
       attempts to persuade Osseiran to make at least a clarification of his misleading statements
       in telegrams to President and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> re US intervention in
       Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he intended to set matters
       straight in a press conference tomorrow with Hearst newspapers. However we pointed out
       official nature of Osseiran’s communication and injury done US by a message from President
        <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0370"/>of Lebanese Parliament. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> finally agreed to suggestion he telegraph President <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> as one head of state to another indicating Osseiran
       spoke for himself only and in disregard of constitutional law; while at same time he would
       ask <persName>Sami Solh</persName> as Prime Minister to send a similar communication to
        <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>On domestic political problem and question whether if Parliament can meet July 24 a
       President can be elected, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> seemed almost wholly
       at sea. He said he was undertaking consultations and would know by Monday or Tuesday what
       possibilities were both for holding a parliamentary session and with respect to what
       candidates might have a chance of election. At this point of interview <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s weary mind seemed almost to black out. He furrowed his
       brow and had at times difficulty in recalling what he had said only moments before. At one
       point he startled us by asking “what would you think if I resigned before July 24 in order to
       force Parliament to meet?” This suggestion had reference to provision in Lebanese
       constitution that on removal for whatever cause of chief of state temporary head of
       government becomes cabinet, which in turn is called upon mandatorily to convene parliament
       immediately for purpose of electing a new president. I suggested he wait before acting on
       such a desperate course as certainly repercussions from outside Lebanon would not be very
       favorable either to himself or ourselves.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BVACR1">Brown</persName> who has known President for some
       years said he was shocked at degree to which <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       had physically and psychologically declined since he last saw him. <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> who has been in almost daily contact with <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> during last two months of crisis informs me he had
       definite impression President may be suffering from some physical or psychological
       disturbance. This was first day for example in Ambassador’s experience <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> did not use tobacco. A man with a medical record of two
       heart attacks, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> did not look in physically good
       shape this morning. This is his 68th day without leaving the presidential residence.</p>

      <p>On July 19, a message from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Nikita S. Khrushchev</persName>,
       Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to
       President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was presented to the U.S. Embassy
       in Moscow. The text of the message was transmitted to Washington in telegram 170 from Moscow,
       July 19, and subsequently released in Moscow and Washington. (Eisenhower Library, Whitman
       File, International Series; text of the letter is printed in Department of State <hi
        rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 11, 1958, pages 251–233) In the letter, <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> stated that “armed intervention” by the United
       States in Lebanon and by Britain in Jordan, and the danger of intervention in Iraq and
       elsewhere in the Middle East posed the danger of a general conflagration. To prevent such a
       catastrophe, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> proposed a conference of the
       heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, France, and India
       to meet to consider the crisis in the Middle East. He also proposed participation by the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Secretary-General, and suggested that the conference be
       held in Geneva on July 22, although he was prepared to meet anywhere else if preferable. He
       noted that he had addressed similar letters to the leaders of the other three countries
       involved, and to the Secretary-General. (Copies of all of the letters were released by the
       United Nations on July 20 as <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. S/4059)</p>
      <p>On July 20, Presidential Press Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>
       issued the following statement in response to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> letter: “The United States is carefully studying the Soviet note and
       intends promptly, after appropriate consultations, to make a calm and constructive response.
       It will not undercut and, we hope, will enhance the work of the United Nations which has been
       so well begun. We think it vital that the work of the United Nations Security Council
       energetically go on.” For full text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

      <p><hi rend="italic">Soviet Proposal for an Immediate Summit Meeting</hi>—The Secretary read a
       draft press statement which he proposed to issue immediately commenting on Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s invitation.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">See <ref
         target="#d200">Document 200</ref>.</note> He felt it important to contradict at once the
       Russian imputation of aggression to the United States and the United Kingdom over their
       actions in Lebanon and Jordan respectively. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
       said that while he had no comment on the text of the proposed statement, he would not wish to
       reach any decision yet on the substance of the reply to the Russian proposal for a meeting.
       The Secretary agreed, although his own feelings about a meeting were very negative.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Lebanon</hi>—The Secretary said that he had seen Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, who had spoken by telephone to President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> just previously. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> implied that the American entry into Lebanon had still left the main
       problems of Communism and Nasserism unaffected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> had agreed that no attempt at a solution of these problems by force was
       likely to be profitable but had no useful suggestion to make. He did not suggest that the
       United States should leave Lebanon. He thought that the elections should be postponed for
       some little time although not beyond the last date in September required by the Constitution.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that we should aim for an agreed
       international status for Lebanon by which the country would undertake not to join the United
       Arab Republic or any Western alignment. The Secretary made clear his intention that United
       States forces should remain in Lebanon until some satisfactory alternative to their presence
       had been found which would ensure the independence and security of that country. If this was
       to take the form of a United Nations force he could not envisage anything being built up
       which would take the place of the United States forces inside two or three months. If,
       however, President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> should ask for the United
       States to leave a new situation would arise. He also considered that Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion for an international solution deserved very
       serious consideration.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> emphasized that the United Kingdom would
       back the United States “to the hilt” in remaining. In further discussion, Sir <persName
        corresp="#p_HSW1">William Hayter</persName> and Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1"
        >Hood</persName> urged that it was essential to set the United Nations to work on a
       political solution and that this was more desirable than any attempt to form a United Nations
       force in Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> pointed to the difficulty
       in restoring order in the country when the Government in Beirut appeared to be the prisoner
       of the insurgents and the Lebanese Commander-in-Chief reluctant to take any firm action. The
       Secretary said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> had reported from
       Beirut in very gloomy terms.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">See <ref target="#d197">Documents
         197</ref> and <ref target="#d199">199</ref>.</note> The local political situation was
       dubious, President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had been prisoner for the
       last sixty-</p>
      <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0374"/>
      <p>seven days in his house and the presence of the United States forces had not effected any
       change in the internal situation. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       asserted that divisions of opinion amongst his own personnel made action against the rebels
       impossible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> felt therefore that a political
       solution was essential and that the election of a new President would ease the tension. The
       United States forces could then leave, claiming that their mission had been successful.
       Unless some solution could be rapidly devised such sobering effect as the military action had
       achieved would speedily be dissipated. Lord Hood suggested that this provided an argument for
       a meeting with the Russians in that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
       might be brought to agree to tell <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to bring
       insurgent activity in Lebanon to an end. The Secretary agreed that a political solution was
       needed which might be found through United Nations resolution creating a separate and
       independent status for Lebanon, making it a ward of the United Nations and keeping it out of
       the United Arab Republic, but this would take longer than putting in a United Nations
       force.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of the Persian Gulf, Iran, and Sudan.]</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> referred to
       the request made by King Hussein for help in restoring the Arab Union by the movement of
       Jordanian forces into Iraq. He asked whether the Secretary believed that the position in Iraq
       was beyond redemption. The Secretary confirmed that this was his belief and said that he
       thought hints being given in Baghdad of Iraqi readiness for friendship with the West were
       part of a facade intended to deceive the West. Sir <persName corresp="#p_HSW1">William
        Hayter</persName> said that he thought King Hussein’s proposal was made for the record and
       was not to be taken seriously. It was agreed that the same objections to any action by Jordan
       applied as in the case of the Turks and that King Hussein must be firmly discouraged from
       taking action by the same arguments.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Soviet Proposal for Summit Meeting</hi>—This was further discussed. The
       Secretary referred to the agreement which had just been reached between the American Red
       Cross and the East German Red Cross for the release of the American crew of a helicopter
       which had come down in East Germany a month ago. He considered this to be significant and
       that it was probably timed to coincide with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
       >Khrushchev</persName>’s proposal for a meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> suggested that there might be some merit in a meeting with the Russians,
       although not on their terms, and on the basis that there was no question of intervention to
       restore the position in Iraq. The suggestion that the meeting should be composed of the
       United States, United Kingdom, France, India and Russia was advantageous in that it was a
       movement away from the claim for parity. A meeting would give us an opportunity to tell the
       Russians directly where we stood and the risks they would face if they did not respect our
       position and our interests. The real danger of the situation</p>
      <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0375"/>
      <p>was that the Russians might misunderstand our intentions. If we could hold firm and prevent
       the Russians from intervention we might well in the end profit from dissension amongst the
       Arab states stemming from Arab selfishness and narrow-mindedness. The Secretary
        <persName>said</persName> that while not ruling out the possibility of attending a meeting
       he was doubtful of its value. He mentioned a recent discussion with the Yugoslav Chargé
       d’Affaires. He had answered Yugoslav criticism of the United States and British action by
       asking him whether it could be held wrong to assist small countries when they were threatened
       from outside. The Yugoslav Chargé d’Affaires had replied that as a result of their
       discussions with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> the Yugoslavs were convinced
       that a movement of Pan-Arabism was on the way and that to block it was to stand in the path
       of progress. The Secretary commented that that of course was <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s own line. He was therefore doubtful whether Soviet Russia would be
       prepared to take any steps to stop <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and that if
       he were to be stopped it would have to be by the United States and the United Kingdom. Lord
       Hood suggested that if we could convince the Russians that we intended to stop the spread of
       Pan-Arabism in its present violent form the Russians might be prepared to join with us in
       stopping it for fear of a general war unless the situation were brought under control.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Israel</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> reported
       that the Israelis were making difficulties about the over-flying of Israel necessary for the
       Jordan operation and asked whether the United States Government could be of help. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> reported that we were meeting similar
       difficulties with regard to overflights of United States aircraft which we were endeavoring
       to overcome.</p>

        Letter</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> reported London’s view that we
       should complete <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the Lebanese and Jordan
       questions before any get-together with the Russians. The Secretary considered that any
       meeting in the kind of emotional climate the Soviets were producing would be very bad. He
       thought we might consider the calling of an extraordinary meeting of the Security Council. He
       read a draft reply<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">A copy of this draft reply was sent to London
        and Paris for comment on July 20 in telegrams 708 to London and 298 to Paris. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 396.1/7–2058) Copies of these telegrams initialed by <persName

        International Series.</note> to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s message
       calling for a Summit conference on Middle East questions which was discussed at some
       length.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> then read an analysis from the British
       Embassy, Moscow, which concluded that there were advantages in talking with the Russians:
       first, because of the danger of war that might arise from a Soviet miscalculation of Turkish
       intentions and secondly, because the make-up of the meeting <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> proposed was better than might <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
        facs="0378"/>be expected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> thought Nehru
       and Hammarskjold would be helpful if our objective was some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       or international status for Lebanon. The Secretary saw some advantage in the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forum as being more orderly and one in which agenda and other
       procedures had to be followed but there were certain disadvantages such as the participation
       of people not directly involved, the problem of Iraqi credentials, and others. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> felt we should make some positive proposal in reply to
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter. The Secretary observed that to
       accept the proposal would be to have a meeting at the Summit on terms we have always
       resisted. Such a meeting would be unprepared, limited to the Middle East and produce nothing
       but demagoguery. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> thought we had a good
       issue in the independence of little states. The Secretary assented but pointed out that many
       of the little Arab states did not seem to want independence. He cited a recent report<note
        n="3" xml:id="d204fn3">Not further identified.</note> from the Arab Section of Jerusalem and
       referred to the Yugoslav Chargé’s view of the “historic inevitability” of the Pan-Arab
       movement. The Secretary believed our position in Lebanon and the British position in Jordan
       was going to become very dangerous shortly. To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName>’s question what the Russians meant when they referred to the “Middle
       East”, the Secretary recalled that last year <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       had interpreted it to mean all of the Middle East.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Baghdad Pact</hi>—With reference to the Baghdad Pact states, the
       Secretary said it would be a source of bitterness if we had a Summit meeting before talking
       to them. Our basis for action in Lebanon and Jordan was in response to the appeal of small
       countries. If we rushed into a Summit, it would jeopardize the support we have gotten on this
       basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> recalled that the Baghdad Pact
       meeting was scheduled to be held in London next Monday.<note n="4" xml:id="d204fn4">July
        28.</note> After some discussion as to whether there was any advantage in advancing it a
       couple of days, it was agreed that on balance it was better to hold it as scheduled. The
       Secretary undertook to reach London on Sunday and be available for informal talks and to stay
       on through Monday to attend the first day of the regularly scheduled meeting of the

      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> began the review of points needing
       consideration or discussion. We have thought the Japanese resolution<note n="2"
        xml:id="d205fn2">See <ref target="#d195">Document 195</ref>.</note> in the United Nations
       could be the basis for our next steps regarding the Middle East situation. If the Soviets
       veto it, we would still go ahead under action the Secretary General will suggest. He proposed
       to the President a statement for public release to the effect that we wish, despite <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s message,<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">See <ref
         target="#d200">Document 200</ref>.</note> to continue with efforts in the United Nations.
       The President approved the statement with minor editing after considering and dropping as not
       feasible for inclusion a reference to our desire to remove our forces from Lebanon.<note
        n="4" xml:id="d205fn4">For text of this statement, issued on July 20, see <ref
         target="#d200">Document 200</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>The President said he felt we have not yet seen an avenue out of our over-all problem in
       the Middle East in light of the Arab sympathies toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>—which are probably greater than we thought existed. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that we have an immediate demand upon us to
       reassure governmental leaders—the mob scene in Baghdad has scared them very badly. The
       President thought there were many thoughtful comments and observations in Nehru’s message to
       him—even though it reflected an erroneous assumption that there had been no mass infiltration
       into Lebanon. He had also seen an estimate that 90% of the Christians, but only 20% of the
       Moslems, in Lebanon wished to remain independent. He stressed his view that we should have
       moved quickly on the Vice President’s proposal to establish radios in Libya and Sudan, but
       these proposals were obstructed through denial of funds by the Congress for <gloss
        target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of the President’s desire to improve informational programs in the
       Middle East, the approach to take to the new government in Iraq, and general Middle East
       concerns which had been discussed with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> during his visit to Washington.]</p>
      <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0380"/>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the German Ambassador had been
       in to see him, and that Ambassador Bruce had called by telephone. The Secretary had told
       Grewe we were not at all pleased with the lukewarm support given to us at <gloss
        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Germans were concerned as to where we go beyond Lebanon,
       and the Secretary had told the Ambassador we are not going beyond there. He thought that an
       assurance to our friends will quiet them down. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> asked how large a force we have in Lebanon. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said we will have 10, 000 when the second battle group
       arrives—we have about 7, 000 now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he
       thought it was desirable not to send in any more. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
        Dulles</persName> said there are three million barrels of oil stored at Sidon. The Secretary
       thought perhaps we should move up to guard this oil (although this will have bad
       connotations). He said he had asked <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> for his
       recommendation. The President recalled that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had
       suggested moving the Marines into additional areas.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> has a plan for expansion. The consensus seemed to be
       against expanding the forces or the area of deployment in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next said that the British are
       getting into a dangerous situation in Jordan. They cannot leave without the situation
       collapsing, and are in trouble with the Israelis who are objecting to their overflights.
       Ben-Gurion has sent a very sharp letter on this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
        >Herter</persName> said the Israeli objection is that the British have been overflying
       without clearance. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> commented that the
       situation in the area is almost impossible; there is nothing that anyone can rely upon. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that one reason Faisal denied us
       clearance for overflights is that there were press leaks that we were overflying Saudi
       Arabia. The President thought that the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       elements, having taken Iraq, would find Jordan a weakness. For the West to save Jordan may be
       largely a “beau geste.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that the big
       problem is that when we pull out of Lebanon the British will be in trouble in Jordan.
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that, for this reason, the
       British are not anxious for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> solution to the problem in
       Lebanon, and U.S. withdrawal from that area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
        >McElroy</persName> said that the Israelis have given us overflight clearance for <gloss
        target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> to Jordan, in the sense of not interfering with our flights,
       although reserving the right to object. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said he thought the Israelis and British could also work this out, if the
       British will confine themselves to narrow corridors, fly high, and give advance notice.</p>
      <p>The Vice President asked as to what our thoughts are with regard to recognition to Iraq.
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said we must think of the impact on
       the Turks, the Pakistanis and the Iranians. They would greatly resent any quick recognition
       on our part. Also, recognition would amount to acceptance of the dissolution of the Arab
       Union.</p>
      <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0381"/>
      <p>The President said we must consider what our mode of action, or form of approach, should be
       on the Persian Gulf problem. We have talked about supporting the British, but this does not
       necessarily mean sending in a combat team.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that Hammarskjold is saying
       that if others accept the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> proposal for a
       meeting, he would also go. The Vice President stated that if Hammarskjold agrees to do so,
       this action would finish the United Nations in terms of any ability to deal with cases
       involving the large powers. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
       King Hussein has asked us to send troops into Iraq. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> reported that we have turned down this request. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said we must remember that the King was very courageous,
       and saved the whole situation in the Middle East a year ago. The President commented that we
       do not have as good a case for going into Jordan as for going into Lebanon. Also, it is very
       questionable whether we should get into the position of supporting Kings against their
       people. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought we should stay out of
       Jordan, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> agreed. He added, however,
       that we are committed to giving logistic support. The Vice President asked whether it would
       be proper for us to have any contact with the Iraqis at the present time and the Secretary
       told him that our Ambassador is still there and is in contact with them.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next handed to the President a
       first draft of a proposed reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.<note
        n="6" xml:id="d205fn6">See <ref target="#d204fn2">footnote 2, <hi rend="italic"
         >supra</hi></ref>.</note> After minor editing the President discussed at length with the
       group the implied acceptance in the message of having a meeting of Heads of Government under
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices. The Vice President suggested instead referring
       to a Summit Meeting, leaving the present situation to the United Nations. Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also commented that we must avoid anything that would
       indicate acceptance of the Soviet premise that the problem is one of U.S. aggression against
       Lebanon. There was general agreement that the notion of a hostile confrontation of the
       President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> at a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> meeting would have no value, and great harm. Also, we do not wish to be jockeyed
       into the position of having to attack <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> publicly
       in the United Nations. The Vice President suggested that Lodge should stress hard that
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s proposal would weaken and in fact
       vitiate the United Nations. There was consensus that the draft should be reworked to indicate
       that the United States would welcome a resumption of the negotiations, halted by the Soviets,
       for a Summit Meeting—and that the Middle East, among other problems, could be</p>
      <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0382"/>
      <p>considered there. With regard to the present problem, the United Nations should continue to
       deal with it as expeditiously and with as much support as possible.</p>

      <p>566. President tells me he talked at nine this morning with <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> who requested instructions attitude to adopt toward Japanese resolution
        (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>’s 85).<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">Telegram 85 from
         <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, July 19, transmitted the text of the resolution
        submitted by Japan to the Security Council that day. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
        320.5783A/7–1958) The resolution is summarized in <ref target="#d195">Document
        195</ref>.</note><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> added discussion would commence
       in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> within ten hours.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> had reported US delegation felt it should vote in favor as otherwise
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would call for special session of <gloss
        target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> instructed <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> to use his influence against adoption of Japanese resolution. He said, “If
       your forces are compelled to withdraw, it will be regarded as a victory for the opposition
       and your friends in Middle East will feel let down.” <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> added opinion unarmed <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force
       contemplated by Japanese resolution would be ineffective in sealing frontier and preventing
       further infiltration from Syria.</p>
      <p>In broader sphere, President said he was convinced if US did not move affirmatively after
       its landing in Lebanon, we would lose the Middle East. In response to my questions, he
       indicated somewhat evasively this meant military operations against Iraq and Syria with
       corollary of involvement with Egypt, although he did not spell out their names. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he could predict that within six months of our
       withdrawal from Lebanon, trouble would break out again in Middle East in an exacerbated form
       and at that time our chances of resisting being thrown out of Middle East would be much less
       bright.</p>
      <p>Following this presentation, I thought it wise to go over points outlined Deptel 78.<note
        n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">Not found.</note> Chamoun listened with attention and indicated</p>
      <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0383"/>
      <p>he had not received a comprehensive summary from <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> of latter’s conversation with Secretary July 19.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d206fn4">See <ref target="#d198">Document 198</ref>.</note></p>
      <p>In response to my question whether there might not be a middle ground between all-out war
       in Middle East now as he and <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> seem to advocate and
       our instant withdrawal, I pointed out that even if Japanese resolution were adopted,
       Hammarskjold would have his hands full and much time would necessarily elapse before he could
       send expanded <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force to Lebanon and before we left country.
       I offered personal thought display of US might and promptitude with which it was manifested
       last week might serve to instill a feeling of caution in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> and Soviet Government. I did not think our troops would withdraw
       precipitously nor in advance of proper arrangements, if Japanese resolution were adopted, for
       staging in of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer force.</p>
      <p>Main burden of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s argument can be summarized
       as follows: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>He is very much opposed to adoption of Japanese resolution.<note n="5"
          xml:id="d206fn5"><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> called on <persName
           corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in his office on the afternoon of July 21 to stress
          Lebanon’s objections to adoption of the Japanese resolution. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
           >Dulles</persName> replied that the United States planned to vote for the resolution
          because it would “enlarge the responsibility of the United Nations in connection with the
          Lebanese question and would provide for taking certain additional measures to ensure the
          integrity and independence of Lebanon.” He did agree, however, to support a Lebanese
          request for postponement of consideration of the resolution to allow the Lebanese
          Government to reevaluate the situation. (Memorandum of conversation, July 21; Department
          of State, Central Files, 783A.00/7–2158) That evening, the Department telegraphed
          instructions to the Embassy in Beirut to approach President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> and outline the Secretary’s arguments in favor of supporting the
          Japanese resolution and preventing an open split between the United States and Lebanon at

       President outlined recent requests he had made to General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>That Lebanese Army undertake offensive operations to clean out Basta and at least to
         immobilize threat against communications in the Chouf.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Failing such action by Lebanese Army, that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> agree to two battalions of Gendarmérie (1000 men) supported by army
         artillery and aviation, to be used for these offensive operations.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>President said so far as US forces were concerned he would be highly appreciative if they
       could be deployed along frontier to seal off further Syrian infiltration. He quoted General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as warning such action by our troops might in
       fact increase such infiltration, but that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> would
       have “no objection” if American forces were so deployed.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> pointed out that without
       expressing any opinion on this request from President it would be clearly impossible for
       American forces to be deployed along frontier so long as their line of communications were
       threatened from the Basta. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>
       indicated it was sine qua non for the Basta to be liquidated. He told President of his
       conversation yesterday afternoon with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> (Embtel
        554)<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">In telegram 554 from Beirut, July 20, <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported on a meeting at his residence between
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
         >Holloway</persName> which illustrated the growing cooperation between U.S. and Lebanese
        forces. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> felt that the presence of the U.S.
        troops had discouraged Lebanese insurgents, who were, in his view, no longer willing to
        respond to Syrian instigation but were actively seeking a political solution to the crisis.
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was eager to establish joint military-police
        shore patrols, and discussed joint planning to facilitate the movement of U.S. forces in the
        country, but he was not prepared to undertake operations to eliminate the opposition
        stronghold in the Basta. <p>(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/7–2058; included in the

      <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> if he had made any suggestions to
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> for purging his senior staff. President said
       he was still offering suggestions to this end but clearly indicated his advice fell on
       negative ear. Both Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and I urged on
       President danger of taking any step which might push <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"

       cooperation between Lebanese and US military.</p>
      <p>Conclusions: (1) We do not feel US deployment along Syrian border either necessary or
       wise.</p>
      <p>(2) Key is reduction of the Basta as this will bring an end to revolution and eliminate
       reason for further Syrian infiltration and therefore any requirement for US deployment on
       frontier.</p>
      <p>(3) We feel by patient improvement of relations with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and his staff, even admitting grave deficiencies of that staff, Admiral
        <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> will be able to negotiate <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> into a position of positive action with or without US
       forces. Similar Fabian methods of persuasion with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> may also make it possible to bring about needed staff changes.</p>

      <p>Lord Hood called at his urgent request having received instructions containing British
       views on the line of action and proposed replies to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> proposal of July 19.</p>
      <p>Reading from these instructions Lord Hood said that since <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> had mentioned the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss>, the Foreign Office agreed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName>’s proposal would be handled <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0386"
       />and replied to by the United States proposal for a special meeting of the Security
        Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">This proposal was in the draft reply to <persName
         corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter; see <ref target="#d204fn2">footnote 2,
         Document 204</ref>.</note> However, the Foreign Office made the following observations in
       this connection: (1) It should be made clear at the outset that the special Security Council
       meeting would in fact be attended by the heads of Government and that President <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would be available at least part of the time. For
       his part Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> was ready to attend
       (2) It should also be made clear that this <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting would
       make possible other informal meetings outside the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> between
       the representatives of the participant governments directly concerned (3) In addition to the
       regular membership of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> there was a possibility under
       Article 31 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3"
        >Article 31 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Charter provides that any <gloss
         target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> member which is not a member of the Security Council may
        participate, without vote, in the discussion of any question brought before the Council
        whenever the Council considers that the interests of that member are specifically
        affected.</note> of inviting other governments to participate in the special Security
       Council meetings notably India which had been mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName>. Such participants also should be available and eligible to attend
       appropriate outside informal meetings (4) Finally it should be made clear that the special
       meeting would be for the purpose of discussion only and that no resolutions would be put
       forward except such as might be agreed in advance among the major participating powers. Lord
       Hood explained that this was to alleviate any fears on the part of <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> that he would be faced with a voting procedure which
       might isolate him or put him in the minority.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office hoped that the British and French Governments would agree on these
       points. The British <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representative, Sir Pierson (Bob)
        <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Dixon</persName>, would be instructed to make observations along
       the foregoing lines in supporting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s
       proposal for a special Security Council meeting.</p>
      <p>The Secretary who had taken exception to Lord Hood’s opening remarks interjected that there
       was no such US proposal to be presented in the Security Council today saying that he did not
       know how the British could have received such an impression. Lord Hood indicated that the
       source had been Sir Pierson <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Dixon</persName> in New York.</p>
      <p>However, before discussion was resumed on this point Lord Hood finished reading his
       instructions saying that the British proposed to reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> along the foregoing lines though they would dismiss <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s distortions rather more shortly than in the US
       note.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then asked Lord Hood if he were familiar with the reference to a special
       Security Council meeting as contained in our proposed reply which Lord Hood thereupon reread.
       The Secretary <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0387"/>then said that we did not consider a
       summit meeting would be desirable at this time and in this atmosphere in which we would be
       accused of being the disturbers of peace. Our language simply put up to the Soviets the
       proposition that they could turn to the Security Council if they considered there was a
       threat to the peace and if they wanted such a meeting but we frankly hoped they would not. We
       want to calm things down. He then cited the strong German opposition to a high level meeting
       and said we were in great danger of having disarray in our own ranks. The Secretary went on
       that perhaps the British had based their proposals on our first draft. He would say that
       there had been some shift in our own thinking on the subject. It was clear that if we should
       take the initiative in calling for a <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting we would be in
       a bad position in which we would be accused of breaking the peace and <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would be in the position of saving it. The position
       would be very complicated and difficult. Our defense would require us to attack <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, who would not even be present, as regards the
       developments in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. Meanwhile, the Soviets would be attacking us. He
       had not really had time to think through what the results of such a meeting would be. If
       there were a break, then this would be bad for the peace rather than good.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood cited <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> as considering it
       desirable that we make clear our intentions and our interests in the Middle East to prevent
       Soviet misinterpretation or miscalculation. When the Secretary commented that such a meeting
       was not necessary for this purpose, Lord Hood said that is was in the British view desirable
       to say these things to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> across the table. He
       suggested it might also be possible to reach agreement as regards Lebanon and Jordan. In
       response to this the Secretary asked who would support a neutralist Jordan. As he understood
       it the British were not in a position to assume this burden and the mounting Congressional
       opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> proposal in this country
       made it unlikely that Congress would be willing to support appropriations for this purpose.
       Lord Hood said that he had no answer to this question but repeated that the rough lines of a
       political agreement might be possible to work out.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then asked why we should at this stage, just because of the <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> initiative, reverse the consistent position we had
       been taking in opposition to a discussion of the Middle East at a summit conference. Lord
       Hood said that the British feel that in view of developments the British now feel that it
       would be unrealistic to exclude such discussion. In fact the proposed informal talks
       associated with a high level <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting could be regarded as a
       part of the preparation for a general summit conference.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then repeated that there had been some shift from our preliminary ideas
       discussed with <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> as a result of the White
       House conference yesterday and increasing congressional opposition <pb n="356"
        xml:id="pg_356" facs="0388"/>to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
       proposal. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants to convoke a Security Council
       meeting that is all right but it would be unsound for us to take the initiative or to
       encourage such a meeting.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood replied that it was clear that his instructions were based on a misunderstanding
       in New York and said that he would take immediate corrective action as far as this
       afternoon’s Security Council meeting is concerned. The Secretary said he thought it was
       important that this be done immediately.</p>
      <p>In response to Lord Hood’s question as to what would happen if the Japanese resolution<note
        n="4" xml:id="d208fn4">See <ref target="#d195">Document 195</ref>.</note> passed, the
       Secretary made it clear that the US did not propose to take any initiative to enlarge the
       scope of Security Council action. This was a question for the Russians. He emphasized that
       there was an agreed and established procedure for the handling of alleged threats to the
       peace, reading from the text of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. This clearly
       delegated the responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> on behalf of all <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members so that there could be no complaints from any of our
       allies that they had been left out. Lord Hood then asked if we took the position that there
       was no threat to the peace, adding that the Russians themselves might be considered to be
       posing a threat which would make desirable a discussion on broad lines of the situation in
       the Middle East. The Secretary replied that our immediate quarrel is with <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s extreme Pan-Arabism. This places the Soviets in an
       advantageous position of being able to attack us while it does not serve our interests to
       have to pursue a public attack on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Lord Hood
       said that there was widespread feeling in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> that this was
       in fact a dangerous situation; that the presence of our troops in the Middle East made
       incidents possible which might have explosive potentialities.<note n="5" xml:id="d208fn5"
         ><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HVS1"
         >Hood</persName> continued their discussion at <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
         >Dulles</persName>’ residence that evening, and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
         >Dulles</persName> observed that the Middle East crisis offered an opportunity which might
        not recur:<p>“I said to him that I was convinced that the Soviets were in a state of concern
         because they feared that our moves in the Middle East might confront them with a choice
         between accepting a great setback in the Middle East or accepting the risk of general war.
         They could not accept the latter because they had gambled on not developing many long-range
         bombers and had not yet adequate missiles in operation. We would probably not have another
         such chance. But probably we did not have the nerve to take advantage of the probabilities.
         The likelihood was that this would be our last fair chance and that we would let it
         pass.</p>
        <p>“Our successors, a decade from now, might pay the price.” (Memorandum of conversation by
          <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, July 21; Department of State, Secretary’s
         Memoranda of Conversations: Lot 64 D 199; included in the microfiche
       supplement)</p></note></p>
      <p>The Secretary said he understood that there was an instinctively different approach to
       these problems between the British and ourselves which we had so far been able to reconcile
       with respect to the preparation for a possible summit talk. When something happens the <pb
        n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0389"/>British immediately think in terms of the Prime
       Minister going somewhere or doing something about it. Under our Constitutional procedure and
       outlook the idea of the President engaging actively in such discussions and negotiations is
       abhorrent. He does not, like the Prime Minister in Parliament, handle these matters in any
       detail with the Congress. The President has plenty of burdens and he leaves these detailed
       matters to the members of his Cabinet.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood then said, “But what shall I say to London?" The Secretary replied that we cannot
       agree at the moment that the President would necessarily go to a Security Council meeting in
       New York even if the Soviets should take the initiative in calling for one. We want to
       discourage a Security Council meeting at the level of heads of government. You want to
       encourage such a meeting. There is a gap to be bridged and we shall wish to ponder this
       further on both sides. Lord Hood said he felt it necessary that there be an indication to the
       Russians that there be more than an ordinary Security Council meeting. He said that while the
       British Government felt such proposals as the present ones should be public, he would like to
       know whether it would be acceptable to us if these be made orally, perhaps by the Ambassadors
       when they deliver a reply to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> letter.
       The Secretary responded that it would be premature today to say that we could go along with
       any such formula. We are concerned about the attitude of the Germans, the Italians, and the
       Turks. We would probably face a revolution in our own camp if we proposed to the Russians
       that we have a series of cosy talks with the Russians in New York. Others among our allies
       would like to be included too. Lord Hood said he did not see how the Germans and Italians
       could object to such meetings, but the Secretary indicated that our position remained as
       stated and that we would have to ponder this question further.<note n="6" xml:id="d208fn6"
         ><persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> telephoned <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
         >Dulles</persName> on July 21 to inquire about developments concerning the Soviet proposal.
         <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported that the British were leaning toward
        a heads of government meeting at the Security Council, and the Canadians also felt that the
        problems of the Middle East should be on the agenda for any summit meeting, but the French
        were more in line with U.S. thinking and opposed a summit meeting on the Middle East.

        corresp="#p_BVACR1">Brown</persName> made certain recommendations after a brief visit to
       Beirut July 18/19. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BVACR1">Brown</persName> recommended that
       American forces in Beirut be reduced to the minimum necessary to protect American lives and
       property; that their objective would be to prevent a military coup and the control of key
       positions leading to reduction or isolation of the Basta area in Beirut to [<hi rend="italic"
        >by?</hi>] the Lebanese Army; to secure the port of Tripoli as increase of US forces permit;
       to seize other key points of infiltration and to seal the Lebanese borders. He also
       recommended a series of broadcasts to the Lebanese people explaining the purposes of the
       American military intervention.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>, Ambassador <persName

       were not discussed by the Admiral while he was here. No doubt there was not adequate
       opportunity. We believe that continuation of the present line will be productive of the best
       results from the US point of view. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>
       particularly is pleased and encouraged over the developing attitude of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, Commander of the Lebanese Forces. There is increasing
       cordiality and cooperation. For us to assume the burden of sealing the Lebanese border which
       consists of almost 200 miles of frontier; to seize other points such as Tripoli at this time
       would be entirely counter-productive from a political point of view in our opinion. Of
       course, this opinion is based on an ignorance of whatever decisions you may have arrived at
       during the course of conversations with <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
       regarding the larger picture. Those decisions conceivably could increase the scope of the
       operation, but we are inclined to believe in the light of your conversation with <persName

         instead of just pointing out that the way is open as we have.” He added: “The French are
         opposed to the British and more in line with us in this respect.” (Eisenhower Library,
         Dulles Papers, White House Telephone Conversations; included in the microfiche
         supplement)</note> Both the British and the French found our proposal a bit too negative.
        The President thought the British approach better than the French and noted that in his
        letter <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> referred to the spirit of the
        Charter more than once. The Secretary said he would be willing to be a little more
        affirmative in our reply with respect to our acceptance of a special Security Council
        meeting with heads of government and Foreign Ministers participating. The President said he
        would be willing to go that far, remarking that he had been under the impression, after
        yesterday’s meeting at the White House,<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">See <ref target="#d205"
          >Document 205</ref>.</note> that that was in fact what we were going to do. He thought we
        could use the language which was in the Secretary’s draft no. 3.<note n="5" xml:id="d210fn5"
         >Not found.</note> There was further discussion in the formulation of our reply and it was
        decided to inform the British and French immediately of our position.</item>

         >footnote 2, Document 203</ref>.</note> Conveyed orally substance Deptel Prime Minister
       Rifai whose reaction was nothing short [of] incredible.</p>
      <p>He began by saying there must be some misunderstanding as <gloss target="#t_HKJ1"
        >HKJ</gloss> had no intention become militarily involved Iraq. According Rifai note cited
       Embtel 171 was only pro forma compliance request Iraqi members AU Parliament now in Jordan
       who asked that King Hussein in his capacity head AU should make formal demand US on behalf
       Iraq under provisions Article 2 and 62 A of AU constitution which provides:</p>
      <p>(1) All international obligations either partner existing time consummation union shall
       continue in force but not be binding on other partner; (2) Arab Union Foreign Ministry shall
       be contact point all foreign relations when Article 74 under which AU assumes responsibility
       conduct its foreign affairs comes into force July 1, 1958. Since Iraqi members AU now
       resident Jordan wish invoke provisions Eisenhower Doctrine as contained paragraphs 2 and 6 of
       joint Iraqi/USG communiqué August 6, 1957 and in view fact legitimate Government Iraq
       incapacitated they decided ask Hussein put on record their formal request USG provide Iraq
       assistance under Eisenhower Doctrine.</p>
      <p>RIFAI emphasized that neither King Hussein nor himself ever had any intention call on USG
       support military intervention Iraq which they regard as unrealistic in view geography,
       military requirements, men/matériel.</p>
      <p>I invited Rifai’s attention to both his and King’s remarks relative to use US/<gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops insure internal security Jordan when “reorganization
       Jordan army withdraw in order make attack on Iraq.” He responded by saying I must have been
       mistaken since His Majesty has no such intention. Rifai continued that <gloss
        target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> request for US military assistance was for sole purpose
       maintenance Jordan integrity/independence. British troops are here for that purpose not for
       anything else. He then proceeded make eloquent appeal immediate dispatch 2500–3000 US troops
       to Jordan on oft-repeated grounds essential maintenance internal security, “take curse off
       return mandate British</p>
      <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0394"/>
      <p>troops.” He dwelt at length on adverse effect presence British having on Jordanian public.
       Confided pamphlets demanding withdrawal British troops have already been distributed Amman,
       also manifest calling for general strike in protest “reoccupation Jordan by <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces.” I again queried Rifai as to reason 6000 foreign troops
       needed keep order. His answer “we are not sure of army officers and the jails aren’t big
       enough to hold all those we suspect”. He said it would not be necessary for me to see Hussein
       personally since he (RIFAI) knew King’s position and could answer for him. Rifai said he
       wished to make clear that any US forces sent Jordan should be “combat seasoned veterans” who
       could command respect people and he wanted them placed where they could be seen by public
       deterrent any revolt.</p>
      <p>In blunt terms I told Rifai Hussein’s action in using his recent press conference attended
       by nearly 100 foreign correspondents to blackmail US into sending troops Jordan would be less
       than productive.<note n="5" xml:id="d211fn5">In telegram 196 from Amman, July 20, the Embassy
        reported that in a press conference on July 19, King Hussein had stated that he had asked
        for U.S. troops to be sent to Jordan, and he “expected them.” (Department of State, Central
        Files, 785.00/7–2058)</note> USG had proved on several occasions it true, tried friend
       Jordan and pledged military/economic assistance needed guarantee Jordan independence. We were
       determined continue this policy but would insist on implementing it by means which will
       insure its success but not at price destruction those institutions we pledged defend.</p>
      <p>RIFAI agreed Hussein had been carried away emotionally by loss his cousin Faisal/members of
       his family which reflected in his press conference conduct. Furthermore because doubtful
       loyalty his own army his and Jordan’s survival might well depend on presence foreign troops.
       As he walked to door with me Rifai again asked I convey my government desire Hussein/himself
       US troops together air force unit be stationed Jordan for psychological reasons. He admitted
       under present circumstances wherein British troops are already in Jordan and Sixth Fleet
       together regional US air support alerted defend Jordan frontier at moment’s notice likelihood
       successful external attack or internal coup quite remote.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Because Rifai reaction diametrically opposed his

       Regardless reasons change all for best from US standpoint, strengthen our position no need US

       would be less than productive, certain play directly into hands Communists/pro-<persName

       they are waging campaign against British. It seems to me our best hope keep Jordan on our

      <p>I told Rifai I could not accept as valid any inference that my government had not fulfilled
       its commitments, giving as examples the seven and a half million dollars turned over to
        <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> during last two days, five and a half million of which
       will be used to meet army payroll July 25. Plus additional five million dollars to finance
       emergency <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> import and wheat and fodder shipments totaling
       20, 000 tons. Rifai agreed this true but unfortunately Hussein had asked for United States
       troops and he had not received them. I again asked Rifai to justify the need for United
       States troops when British had already provided them. His reply which was concurred in by
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName> was to the effect psychologically
       it would be much better to have American as well as British troops Jordan.</p>
      <p>At this point Hussein came in and after usual exchange of pleasantries, proceeded to repeat
       Rifai’s arguments but without any great display of emotion. Nevertheless he left no doubt he
       wanted not only United States ground troops but in addition some United States air power in
       Jordan plus balance British Brigade now in Cyprus bring total foreign troops approximately 7,
       000.</p>
      <p>I asked Hussein if this meant Jordan army to be used outside country. He replied negative.
       Exclusively for internal security. I remarked I had met Pakistani Foreign Office
       representative earlier today and wondered if any proposal had been advanced by the Moslem
       members of the Baghdad Pact re Iraq.</p>

       Hussein and British anxious participation United States troops. Hussein because he announced
       publicly he had requested them therefore he concerned loss of face if they don’t arrive.
       British because resentment return their “mandate army” rapidly increasing with open threats
       murder one or two soldiers as warning they should get out. <gloss target="#t_USARMA1"
        >USARMA</gloss> has been assured by Jordanian army it capable dealing internal security
       problem [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], I have come
       conclusion in light Hussein/RIFAI complete reversal policy toward military intervention Iraq
       that new plan involving joint attack by Turkey, Iran, Pakistan with some assistance Jordan is
       in the making. This would explain supposed need 7, 000 foreign troops who would have no
       choice but perform security duty if Hussein ordered his army join operation against Iraq. My
       opinion every argument advanced by Hussein and British for United States troops is good
       reason we should stay out.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3"><p>On July 23, the Department
         responded, in telegram 273 to Amman, as follows:</p>

      <p>The story of our effort to preserve the peace and to avoid unacceptable deterioration of
       the United States position in the Mid East has been fairly well told in the press; I shall
       not bore you here with its details. The fact is that we will take any honorable and
       practicable solution to the Lebanese problem, so that we can remove our troops. But we must
       insist that the formula is both practicable and honorable.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">In
        briefing legislative leaders on July 22, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
        said that the United States would withdraw its forces from Lebanon as soon as “the <gloss

        (Supplementary Notes on a Legislative Leadership Meeting, July 22; <hi rend="italic"

      <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
      <p>The basic reason for our Mid East troubles is <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
       >Nasser</persName>’s capture of Arab loyalty and enthusiasm throughout the region. Foster and
       I have long struggled with the Congress to get the kind of propaganda campaign established in
       that area that could counteract anti-Western sentiment as it now pours out of the Cairo—and
       Soviet—radios. We have never been able to get the money to do a good job, though today we are
       probably spending more by the month to solve this crisis than it would have cost us by the
       year to have been more effective in preventing it.</p>
      <p>There is no use going over with you all of the ins and outs of our negotiations with the
       Russians. Admittedly they are masters in propaganda, in deceit, in distortion and in
       influencing ignorant populations. At the same time they seem to appeal also to a certain
       percentage of the intelligentsia. But one thing is certain. The men in the Kremlin are
       serving only their own selfish purposes. They are not trying to do anything decent for any
       other portion of humanity.</p>

      <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Friend</hi>: As you may know, since we responded to King
       Hussein’s appeal last Wednesday<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">July 17.</note> we have flown
       something just over 2, 000 British troops into Jordan. They have settled down well and their
       presence has helped to stabilise the position and prevent Jordan going the same way as
       Iraq.</p>
      <p>Both our Representatives in Jordan have now been told by the Prime Minister that if we are
       to continue to hold the position against the threat of subversion it is essential to increase
       the forces on the ground. The Prime Minister has appealed for this. It is clear that unless
       reinforcements are sent there is a real danger that a coup may take place under our very
       noses. I believe that this is a moment of crisis for Jordan and for our whole Middle East
       policy. What is needed is less military than political reinforcement. For this I believe the
       essential thing is that you should send in some American troops to be alongside ours on the
       ground. Not only would this increase the military strength of the forces in Jordan, but it
       will have an extremely favourable political effect, since it will be a visible proof of our
       support for Jordan’s independence.</p>
      <p>At the same time we must face the problem of supply.</p>
      <p>Our troops in Jordan have supplies of food and oil for approximately 12 days together with
       ammunition for a few days local operations. We have been building up these stocks as fast as
       we can to a level where we should have some margin for ordinary consumption and for
       emergencies.</p>
      <p>As you know, however, all our supplies have to be brought in by aircraft which have to
       overfly Israel. We are having great difficulty with <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben
        Gurion</persName> about this and he himself is in political difficulties with his colleagues
       and the Opposition. At the moment, we are continuing to fly our supplies in since we have not
       yet been formally asked to stop, but we are really dependent on <persName corresp="#p_BGD1"
        >Ben Gurion</persName>’s good will and his ability to carry his people with him. I have sent
       him personal <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0399"/>messages, which I hope will help him in
       his difficulties. Meantime, the Israelis have cut down the time during which overflying is
       permitted to nine hours out of the twenty-four, nearly all of which are during the night. We
       are urgently exploring alternative supply routes, including Akaba, but there are difficulties
       about these which will take time to overcome.</p>
      <p>When we first went into Jordan we had our eyes open. We did so relying on the moral
       support, which you have freely given us, and upon your promise to give us logistic aid.</p>
      <p>We have already asked Foster if you could take over the air lift from us and fly in
       essential supplies in American aircraft. I am sure that the Israelis would raise much less
       political objection to your aircraft overflying them, and your Globemasters are so much
       bigger than any of our aircraft that the job could be done with far fewer sorties.</p>
      <p>To sum up, I think we have reached a turning point in Jordan. If we are to hold the
       position, the forces on the ground should be fortified by the visible presence of your
       troops. We must also ensure the safety of their supplies, and both for political and logistic
       reasons I am sure that you are in a much better position to do this than we are. I hope that
       you will be able to do this. It would be disastrous for both you and us if we were forced to
       withdraw before some settlement has been ensured which will preserve the independence of
       Jordan.</p>

        >The Security Council voted on July 22 on the Japanese resolution of July 18 to authorize
        the Secretary-General to take additional measures to insure the integrity and independence
        of Lebanon. The resolution failed of adoption owing to a Soviet veto, despite a 10–1 vote in
        favor. Following the vote, Secretary-General Hammarskjöld made a statement in the Council
        indicating that, in light of the failure of the Council to take additional action in the
        crisis in the Middle East, he intended to expand the activities of the Observation Group in
        Lebanon and take such other action, under the provisions of the Charter and the resolution
        adopted on June 11, as he considered necessary “to prevent a further deterioration of the
        situation in the Middle East and to assist in finding a road away from the dangerous point
        at which we now find ourselves.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Secretaries-General

       said the Sec, but he does not know if we can provide him with money.<note n="5"
        xml:id="d215fn5">In a subsequent memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>

      <p>We are in a Parliamentary difficulty here. Most of the House of Commons and most of the
       press are in favour of a Summit meeting to deal with the Middle East. They may disapprove
       strongly of the offensive terms of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
       invitation and they may accept some argument upon timing, composition and venue, but are
       firmly convinced that a Summit meeting must take place. As I said on Sunday morning,<note
        n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">See <ref target="#d204">Document 204</ref>.</note> I feel that what
       we have to extract from the present situation is a viable international settlement for the
       Lebanon and Jordan—something along the lines of the Austrian Treaty may be the best that we
       can get—leading on to a general settlement.</p>
      <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0402"/>
      <p>I think that the best means of making progress is by some kind of high level talk with
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. As I told you, this would not be a Summit
       meeting in which we would have a series of speeches designed to end up with some rather
       phoney statements about reducing tension and world peace. It would be a high level meeting
       designed to procure viable settlements for two specific problems—Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
      <p>You pointed out your difficulty in Lebanon if the President of the Lebanon were to ask you
       to withdraw. You are aware of the extreme vulnerability of our position in Jordan from an
       operational point of view. Therefore it suits both our interests to get respectable and
       viable settlement as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Now for that kind of purpose I think the participation of Nehru and Hammarskjold has
       positive advantages.</p>
      <p>If all <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s efforts end in a settlement over
       Lebanon and Jordan, I think his balloon will be somewhat punctured. The card we have to play
       in all this is the presence of 10 or 20, 000 American troops in Lebanon, and we must not
       trade this great card of their physical presence in the Lebanon, except for settlement of
       Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
      <p>I really do believe that a top level talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> is the quickest way to get what we both want. I prefer it to be
       limited to the Middle East. In the new situation I doubt whether he could turn it to so much
       advantage in the Arab-Israel controversies. The argument against permitting him to get into
       the Arab-Israel question used to be that his pro-Arab view would make the position of our
       pro-Western and anti-Communist friends in Iraq impossible. That situation unhappily no longer
       exists.</p>
      <p>I have talked to Harold about this and we really both believe it is in our best interest in
       this present situation to press on for some kind of high level meeting.</p>
      <p>On Sunday I accepted your view that it should not be the kind of meeting proposed by
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> nor did I like the idea put from London
       about a special assembly of Heads of Government level. But I did like very much the sentence
       in your original draft,</p>
      <p>“Article 28 of the Charter provides for Security Council meetings at which each of the
       members may if it so desires be represented by a member of its government. If the Soviet
       Union desires a meeting in the Security Council, at which members could be represented by
       Heads of Government or Foreign Ministers, the United States would gladly agree in following
       this orderly procedure.”</p>
      <p>I believe that that is the kind of positive reaction which it is essential that we should
       make in these present circumstances.</p>
      <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0403"/>
      <p>In this way we would avoid being summoned by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> on his own terms and would get a respectable and orderly meeting. I
       showed Harold that passage in your original draft immediately on my return and he liked it
       immensely. I hope that you will restore something on these lines in your reply to <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
      <p>So far as the debate tomorrow in the House of Commons is concerned Harold and I, in order
       to avoid pressure to approve in principle a Summit meting of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> type, as the French and Indians seem inclined to favour, will have to
       put forward some positive alternative. We should therefore like to back strongly the
       alternative of a special Security Council meeting which you seemed to favour last Sunday
       morning.</p>

      <p>Shortly after delivering the text of Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName>’s message to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> (<ref
        target="#d216"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>), Lord Hood delivered to the Department a
       copy of the reply from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> to
       Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> which <persName corresp="#p_HVS1"
        >Hood</persName> noted was being delivered that day. A handwritten note on the source text
       indicated that the text of the message was being released in London at 2 p.m., July 22,
       Washington time, to coincide with <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s
       announcement of the proposal in Parliament. In his reply, <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName> rejected the premises outlined in <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName>’s message, but embraced his conclusion. <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName> proposed a special meeting of the Security Council, to be attended by
       the heads of government suggested by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, or
       designated representatives, to discuss the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName> noted that he was prepared to attend such a meeting, and he assumed
       that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> would attend as well. (Department of
       State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204)</p>
      <p>In light of this development, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> returned a
       letter to <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> that evening through the British
       Embassy: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Matters have moved on your side rather more rapidly than we had anticipated, and I would
         have liked to have had a little more time to concert our views and also to seek closer
         concert with the French. However, in view of your statement in the House of Commons, Mr.
          <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> put out a statement from the White House
         indicating that if a meeting of the kind you suggested were generally desired, the United
         States would join in following this orderly process.</p>
        <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0404"/>
        <p>“Also, learning that you were releasing today the Prime Minister’s message to <persName
          corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, we are doing the same. It is somewhat more
         lengthy than yours. It does contain in substance the sentence which was in my original
         draft, although omitting the word ’gladly’.</p>
        <p>“I hear a rumor that the Soviets will accept on the assumption that the three Western
         Heads of Government will be there. If they accept promptly, it must be that they are really
         frightened about possible developments, perhaps from Turkey.</p>
        <p>“I hope that we are doing the right thing. I can see the advantage of the United Nations
         mantle around Lebanon and some United Nations solution for Jordan, although, as I said, it
         is not clear tome how Jordan can, standing alone, be made into a viable community, and I do
         not think that the United States would go on subsidizing it other than as an emergency
         matter. These are perhaps matters to be thought of.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central

      <p>621. From <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> for Secretary. I am continuing
       series of conversations with leading personalities pro-government, middle-of-the-road and
       opposition. Will report separately substance of these talks. Overall consistent thread from
       all shades of opinion is however agreement on need for prompt presidential elections. Second
       general overall impression is that US landing here is generally welcome by Lebanese including
       some Moslem elements.</p>
      <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this evening with <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>. He asked us as a matter of utmost priority to
       arrange that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> push Lebanese
       Commander General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> into immediate military
       action to clean out Beirut and to reject threat of other rebel forces in south who are
       approaching Damascus highway and may possibly present a threat to Beirut airport. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> estimated their number at 1000.</p>
      <p>President said from basis of his political consultations we could regard it “as settled"
       that presidential elections would be held before end of this month. He said Osseiran, Speaker
       of Parliament, had called on him today and had offered to do his bidding. (A separate
        Embtel<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">Telegram 616 from Beirut, July 22. (<hi rend="italic"

       Osseiran has on his own decided to cancel July 24 meeting of Parliament and to convoke
       Chamber for July 31. We are this evening informally passing word to Speaker indicating our
       hope that elections can in fact take place before that date.)</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said his list of possible candidates was
       narrowing. He mentioned tonight only Jawas Boulos and Alfred Naccache. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he would be very happy to have our recommendations
       as to where choice should fall. We have consistently indicated it would be wise for US to
       refrain from sponsoring any candidate as this would lead to charges an American stooge were
       being elected while US forces were landed in Beirut. However <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> says we talk to him as a friend and he would like to know our opinion.
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> advises that as between Boulos and
       Naccache, who is weak and verged on the valetudinarian, Boulos would be the most acceptable
       candidate. I have not however as yet made up my mind whether to intimate any preference even
       to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</p>

      <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by stating that he wished to discuss with those present
       the letter to the President from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName> which had just been received urging us to send US troops to
        Jordan.<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2"><ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note> The
       Secretary said he wanted to obtain the views of those at the meeting prior to his discussion
       of this subject with the President <persName>this</persName> afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that he had been dubious of the utility of sending forces to Jordan from
       the very start. He said that he had suggested to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName> last week that the British wait until our large air sortie had been
       flown over Jordan, to see whether this show of force was sufficient to stabilize the
       situation. However, before the air mission was flown, the British had already commenced to
       send in their forces.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that the primary problem as he saw it was the question of what the
       Israelis would do if the Western military forces are withdrawn from Jordan. The Israelis, of
       course, assume—as we do—that in that event the present Jordan Government would fall. Would
       they then move into Jordan, at least up to the West bank of the Jordan River, and would that
       start a general war? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that the
       Israelis would not necessarily move; General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>
       felt that they would.</p>
      <p>The question arose about the type of government which would appear in Jordan after Hussein
       was overthrown, and with whom it would probably be allied. It appeared highly probable that a
       leftist government would gain power and, according to Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJL2">Berry</persName>, its orientation would
       be toward the Egypt–Syria axis rather than toward Iraq.</p>
      <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0407"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> indicated that he felt sure that
       Israel would readjust its frontiers to the West bank of the Jordan River if the present
       Jordan Government went out of power. The Secretary asked if this would re-commence an
       Arab-Israel war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said “maybe”. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> indicated, however, that the Arabs would
       have to fight or their treasured “one-nation” concept would be finished. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> also said we must keep in mind that a Saudi Arabian
       coup is most likely soon after there is clear evidence of our withdrawing support from the
       Jordan Government and its consequent downfall.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> asked about the
       northern-tier-plus-Jordan threat to Iraq; had it been fully forestalled. The Secretary
       thought that it had, as did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> spoke of the military situation in
       Lebanon and indicated that our posture there was now such that we could withdraw gracefully
       (in the military sense) if it became desirable to do so. The Secretary stated that he felt
       that the Lebanese situation might work out all right. In particular he alluded to the fact
       that Lebanon was, in itself, a viable state, whereas Jordan was not, and could not stand by
       itself economically. Lebanon, however, may survive under some form of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> umbrella.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> and the Secretary agreed that the
       Soviets were very much afraid of a war commencing in the Middle East at this time. The
       Secretary said that this being the case, we could risk a great deal there if we so desired,
       but he saw no possibility of concrete gain in doing so.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that Jordan might be at least
       retained by us until a Summit meeting took place, so that we could use it as a pawn in any
       settlement. He asked whether we could not send a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
       mission there to maintain a facade of troop support without overly committing ourselves. The
       Secretary replied that, if you commit US prestige sufficiently to satisfy those requesting
       men and matériel, you then lose too much if and when you are forced to withdraw.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> stated that he thought the British would
       keep their troops in Jordan if we only provided them with logistic support. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> concurred, but said that the British alone could
       only retain control in Amman, not the remainder of the country.</p>
      <p>The consensus of this portion of the meeting seemed to be that: the British can hold the
       portion of Jordan around Amman if they have logistic support; probably they can be convinced
       to remain there if we take over this aspect of the problem; and they can only be dislodged if
       the larger portion of Hussein’s army defects and, with aid from the outside, attacks.</p>
      <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0408"/>
      <p>There was then some discussion on the problem of logistic support. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the British were now sending in 20 of their
       aircraft each day. If we took over the Jordan supply problem, they said they would need 6
       C–124’s a day until July 26, and 4 C–124’s a day thereafter. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> stressed, however, that this British estimate was
       probably much too low and they would raise it once they had us committed. In particular, they
       would aver that they had landed their forces with only small arms and what they carried in
       their packs, and they required their armour to retain control of the situation.</p>
      <p>Several expressed their understanding that the supply problem could eventually be licked by
       making use of the ramshackle railway line which goes south from Amman to about 70 kilometers
       from the Port of Aqaba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> mentioned in this
       regard that the British themselves should be able to take over the supply problem once that
       route was repaired (possibly by our engineers) and British commercial shipping could
       transport the supplies to Aqaba. Therefore, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
        >Quarles</persName>, the only question is how long we need send in supplies by air before
       the British can take over the supply route by ship.</p>
      <p>The question was raised of whether the Egyptians would possibly close the Suez to ships
       bringing supplies for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops in Jordan. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said he thought that they would not.</p>

      <p>[Here follows discussion of the problems involved in dealing with Arab nationalism, and
       evolving a viable policy to protect U.S. interests in the Middle East while maintaining
       support for Israel.]</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next took up the draft of a
       possible answer to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>’s letter
       requesting that we send troops into Jordan.<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2"><ref target="#d214"
         >Document 214</ref>.</note> The President asked whether we expect to be able to get a line
       of communications operating through Aqaba before the end of the week, and Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
        >Twining</persName> told him that we do, with use of road and railroad between Aqaba and
       Amman.</p>
      <p>Regarding Jordan, the President said the question in his mind is what kind of outcome we
       can foresee in the long run if the government is kept in power simply by outside troops. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled that we had not wanted the British to
       go in. The President saw difficulty in continuing to back Hussein since we do not have as
       strong a legal basis as we do in Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       said that in a sense Jordan lies in the main stream of the flood of which he had spoken.
       However, we cannot abandon them. Also, we must think of what Israel would do if Jordan goes
       down. It is clear they would act, and would win initially. The Soviets probably would aid the
       Arabs, however, and war would widen, with great pressure on the United States to support
       Israel. He added that the overflights are troubling the Israelis very much, and that they
       have suggested we bring out that we are taking food and medical supplies to the Jordanian
       people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that the British may decide
       not to stay on if we do not send in forces.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">In a telephone
        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> earlier in the day,
         <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> commented that it looked to him as if
         <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> had lost his nerve. (Eisenhower Library,
        Dulles Papers, White House Telephone Conversations; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> He said an Israeli had told him that if Jordan falls into chaos the
       armistice becomes inoperative. While it is not wise to prop up Hussein in a nonviable state,
       it is clear that Israel would take over much of Jordan in the event of revolt. There was then
       discussion as to how to get Britain out of Jordan without starting a general war in the area.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> suggested looking to the United Nations,
       indicating he could not see how to achieve a British withdrawal without a loss of face on
       their part. The group then edited passages in the proposed message referring to this
        matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d221fn4"><ref target="#d222"><hi rend="italic"
        >Infra</hi></ref>.</note></p>
      <p>In a final comment Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> observed that we
       are laboring under an inherent disadvantage in this area in that we are trying to protect
       interests of long standing.</p>

       matter of supply, we are quite ready in principle to help out further in this respect. I
       understand that we are flying <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> from Lebanon to Jordan,
       overflying Israel close to the Syrian border. The Israelis acquiesce in this but do not like
       it. We have told them that we think this need will be over by this week and that an adequate
       substitute can be found in Aqaba where, I believe, intensive work is being done to improve
       the facilities and communication route with Amman.</p>
      <p>We would be willing to use our Globemasters to assist you in flying from Cyprus supplies to
       your forces in Jordan. As you say, a smaller number of these larger planes could do the job
       you are doing. However, we would have to seek and find some accommodation with Israel. Foster

       hope to get a reply by tomorrow. I am convinced that whatever be the immediate outcome, we
       cannot look upon these over-flights of Israel as a permanent solution. We must concentrate
       upon getting what is needed into Aqaba, preferably by commercial vessels because of Arab
       sensitiveness about non-Arab naval vessels in the Gulf. Then we must quietly create better
       ways to get the cargoes to the Amman area.</p>

      <p>On July 23, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> addressed a second
       letter to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> concerning the Soviet
       proposal for a summit meeting to consider what <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> referred to as “a threat to peace in the region of the Near and
       Middle East.” The letter was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow at 10 p.m. local time
       and the text was transmitted to the Department of State in telegram 216 from Moscow, July 23.
       (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1/7–2358) The text of the letter was subsequently
       released and is printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
        1958</hi>, pages 999–1000. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> addressed
       similar letters on July 23 to British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName>, French President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,

       S/4064, July 23, 1958. In his letter to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> accepted the concept of a Security Council
       meeting as the framework for discussions on the Middle East, but proposed that the meeting
       involve the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom,
       France, and India, although India was not currently a member of the Security Council. He
       again emphasized the urgency of such a meeting which he proposed should begin in the Security
       Council on July 28.</p>
      <p>An assessment of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s second letter by
       several senior Department of State officials on July 23 concluded: “<persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in the guise of accepting a Security Council meeting
       is in fact planning a summit meeting on the terms of his original proposal, that is, the
       Heads of Government of the U.S., the U.K., the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, France
       and India plus the Secretary-General of the United Nations. To accomplish <pb n="380"
        xml:id="pg_380" facs="0412"/>this he has distorted <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName>’s language proposing a meeting in the ’forum’ of the Security Council
       to mean ’within the framework of the Security Council.” They recommended to the Secretary
       that: “Our reply should make it clear that we are not prepared to participate in a meeting
       organized on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s proposal.”

       tape, although we have not yet received his official reply. Most of us thought that he would
       refuse, pleading China as an excuse. However, it seems that he wants to come after all. We
       feel a little guilty here that we have let you in for this, but I think the way we have all
       played it together has two major benefits. First, it is clear that the Russians are quite
       frightened at the prospect of your immense power and they have no intention of letting loose
       a general conflict in which they would come off worst. Secondly, I think we have rallied to
       our side all that strange, floating, moderate opinion not only in our countries, but in the
       European countries. Including many N.A.T.O. countries who are always attracted to the idea of
       talk. This also applies significantly to Asia and even to some more robust peoples like the
       Canadians.</p>
      <p>In addition, our positions in the Lebanon and Jordan are both very precarious; yours in the
       Lebanon politically, because of a sudden change of attitude by the Lebanese Government which
       would make it difficult for you to stay; ours in Jordan, logistically and militarily because
       we are in an exposed position. A general conference in which we might be able to force upon
       the Soviets a settlement of these two particular cases might strengthen our position.</p>
      <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0413"/>
      <p>However, the main thing now is that we should deal with this new situation together in the
       closest co-operation. What we have to consider is the timing and the conditions for the
       proposed meeting in New York. Now that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
       has committed himself, I think we can take quite a firm view on the details.</p>
      <p>Harold wishes me to thank you particularly for your co-operation and to tell you that, as a
       result, he now feels that he has an absolutely united country behind him. This is of
       considerable importance in the larger picture. There is a feeling here of unity and purpose
       in facing up to our problems such as we have not had since the war, and as you know so well,
       this is a great asset with our people.</p>
      <p>I would be grateful for your preliminary thoughts, and Harold and I are looking forward
       tremendously to seeing you to talk it all over.</p>

      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> presented an oral report on the results of
       discussion by the NSC Planning Board of U.S. courses of action designed to prevent the United
       States from appearing to oppose Arab nationalism and to counter hostile radio broadcasts in
       the Near East. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>’s briefing note is
       filed in the minutes of the meeting, and another is attached to this memorandum.)<note n="2"
        xml:id="d226fn2">Included in the microfiche supplement.</note> Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called on the Secretary <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"
        facs="0415"/>of State for an oral briefing on the situation in the Near East from the
       diplomatic and foreign policy standpoint.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the situation in Lebanon seems
       to be as satisfactory as can reasonably be expected. Since U.S. forces entered the country,
       rebel activities and foreign promotion of such activities had substantially decreased.
       Relations between the Lebanese and the U.S. forces have been good, and no violent incidents
       have occurred. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Robert Murphy</persName> was presently in
       Lebanon talking with President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, and rebel leaders, in an effort to bring
       about early elections to choose a successor to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.
       While the elections could be held at any time after today, Parliament would probably not be
       convened for at least another week. The Secretary thought that if a successor to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could be elected and if the United Nations effort could
       be stepped up, the situation would become better and in fact reasonably secure. In the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council a Japanese Resolution had been vetoed by the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which had been the only member to oppose it. However,
       the Secretary General of the United Nations had said he would carry out the spirit of the
       Resolution under the general authority granted him by the Charter. Accordingly, the Secretary
       General was actively recruiting additional personnel for the United Nations in Lebanon in
       order to throw the mantle of the United Nations around Lebanon and make it a United Nations
       ward. The United States was maintaining good working relations with the Secretary
       General.</p>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought the situation in Jordan was
       not quite as favorable as in Lebanon. The United Kingdom had requested that U.S. forces be
       introduced into Jordan to stand beside the British forces and take over much of the supply
       effort. Such a move would involve the question of over-flights of Israel, to which Israel was
       objecting. The Secretary had discussed this question yesterday with the Israeli Minister, and
       had an appointment with the Israeli Ambassador today. Meanwhile, efforts were being stepped
       up to improve communications facilities in Jordan. For example, it was hoped that a 50-mile
       stretch of road between Aqaba and Amman could be put in shape so that adequate supplies could
       be moved by sea and land. At present, adequate supply was dependent upon an airlift.
       Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that this morning the internal
       situation in Jordan had improved. The King had indicated that there was no real need for U.S.
       forces in his country, but he continued to want U.S. forces in Jordan as a symbol of U.S.
       interest. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he did not wish,
       however, to leave the impression that Jordan was secure. The situation remained dangerous,
       with a large part of the army of doubtful loyalty and with large numbers of Palestinian
       refugees capable of mob action. Nevertheless, the immediate</p>
      <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0416"/>
      <p>situation leading to Western intervention had been met; that is, a careful plot to take
       over the Government of Jordan along the lines of the Iraqi coup seemed to have been thwarted
       or postponed.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
      <p>Israel is deeply concerned over the situation in the Near East. The Israelis feel that the
       presence of U.S. forces in Lebanon and U.K. forces in Jordan gives them more protection for
       the time being, but they are fearful of future developments. If a coup occurred in Jordan, it
       is not clear what the Israelis would do. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> said that he had asked the Israelis this question and a definitive answer
       would be forthcoming shortly. The Israeli interim reply had stated that chaos in Jordan would
       invalidate the armistice agreement between Israel and Jordan, and leave Israel free to take
       the action necessary to its own security. This was a highly dangerous situation which might
       result in the renewal of Arab-Israeli hostilities.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
      <p>The Director of the U.S. Information Agency referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
        >Gray</persName>’s report of the Planning Board’s discussion on jamming of hostile radio
       broadcasts. He wished to point out that if Radio Cairo broadcasts were jammed, there might be
       additional tension and agitation among the West Bank refugees in Jordan. If these refugees
       were suddenly deprived of their accustomed Cairo broadcasts, then resentment against the
       government in Amman would be increased, possibly enough to tip the scales toward revolt. This
       consideration should be carefully weighed before any decision to jam Cairo broadcasts.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that from the public relations point
       of view, it would be a very bad thing for the United States to get involved in Jordan. The
       United States had a convincing story on Lebanon and we have some hope of coming out of the
       Lebanese situation with honor and dignity, but our position is not the best even in Lebanon.
       In Jordan, public support for the government is no greater—and possibly less—than Iraqi
       public support was for the deposed Iraqi regime; so that foreign intervention is difficult to
       justify before world opinion. If we support King Hussein, a monarch with no roots in the
       country and among the people, we will be in a very bad position. Jordan was an artificial
       creation resulting from World War I, with no history. Recently the Senate in the Sudan had
       unanimously condemned U.S.–U.K. action in the Near East. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
        >Allen</persName> was afraid if we stay on this wicket, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> will beat us to death in public opinion. We must adjust to the tide of Arab
       nationalism, and must do so before the hotheads get control in every country. The oil
       companies should be able to roll with the punches, and will in fact be on a firmer foundation
       in Iraq in the future than under the old regime.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated subjects.]</p>
      <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0417"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called on the Chairman of the Joint
       Chiefs of Staff for an oral briefing from the U.S. military viewpoint. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said the situation in Lebanon was calm. Lebanese
       snipers had been firing at our planes near the airport, but there had been no casualties from
       enemy action. Cooperation between U.S. and Lebanese armed forces had been satisfactory. The
       Lebanese Army was reluctantly seeking to bring the rebel forces under control, but this
       operation was not proceeding as rapidly as was desirable. The rebels were still unmolested in
       the Basta, their stronghold in Beirut. The landing of U.S. forces in Lebanon had taken place
       in accordance with a contingency plan (code name: Blueback)<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">The
        correct code name was “Blue Bat.” See <ref target="#d40">Document 40</ref>.</note> prepared
       in May. The original plan had provided that the Marines and the Army would establish lodgment
       in Beirut, and that U.K. forces would also enter Lebanon. However, a political decision had
       been made that the United Kingdom would not participate in the Lebanon landings and the plan
       had been adjusted accordingly. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then
       caused two maps to be displayed, one showing the disposition of U.S. forces in Beirut and
       adjacent areas, and the other showing the disposition of U.S. forces in the Near East.
       General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said there were about 6000 Marines in
       Lebanon, about 1700 Army troops adjacent to the Beirut airport, and a contingent of Army
       support forces which would bring the Army total to 2500. In connection with the map showing
       the disposition of U.S. forces in the Near East, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
        >Twining</persName> pointed out that a Marine landing team was enroute to the area from
       Okinawa. U.S. airborne forces in Germany and in the United States had been alerted. The U.S.
       Navy had two attack-carrier striking groups in the Mediterranean. General <persName
        corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the logistic support for the operation in
       Lebanon had been provided by transport aircraft which had now returned to the United States.
       Tankers and refueling planes had remained in the area. The airlift capabilities of U.S.
       forces in Europe and <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> capabilities were being used.
       About 20 per cent of our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> forces had been placed on
       15-minute alert, and a large proportion of the remaining <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
       forces had been put on a relatively short alert. Air defense command units had also been put
       on a short alert. U.S. jet planes recently made a low-level demonstration over Jordan which
       had apparently been effective. British forces in Jordan had been airlifted from Cyprus. The
       United States had assisted the operation in Jordan by airlifting oil.</p>

      <p>658. From <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. As indicated Embtel 621,<note
        n="2" xml:id="d227fn2"><ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>.</note> I have had a number of
       interviews with varied sectors of Lebanese political opinion relating to Middle East
       situation in general, to opinions on US landing in Lebanon, and to an internal political
       solution of Lebanese problem. Following are highlights of these conversations: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Maronite Patriarch Meouchi, the Patriarch who for 14 years was a priest in the US and
         at one time was an American citizen, celebrated mass which I and <persName
          corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> attended early Sunday morning. We later
         breakfasted with the Patriarch who is one of the most <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387"
          facs="0419"/>political prelates I have encountered. His view is infected by an overbearing
         hatred of President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. In his calmer moments,
         the Patriarch revealed a Munich-type of mind advocating appeasement with <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and a “positive" neutral stance for Lebanon. Although
         he was coy in indicating preference for any particular presidential candidate, he did say
         he thought it was now impossible for General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
         to be elected president (although he revealed that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> comes to him frequently for counsel). Drift of his argument was in
         favor of electing former President Bechara el-Khoury. My general impression of the
         Patriarch is that he is partisan and up to his armpits in the campaign against <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He would accept a compromise candidate such as
         Hitti.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Sami Solh</persName>: This pleasant if wily
         old ex-magistrate, obviously a seasoned politician who because of his position as a
         Sunni-Moslem, is useful to US, although he has been “excommunicated” by the Moslem Mufti.
         The Prime Minister was delighted at our landing and feels most Lebanese agree with him. I
         would estimate that he is pretty well at the end of his career.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Turkish Ambassador, Cevdet Dulger, a diplomat of long experience in the Moslem world.
         He has a refreshingly simple approach to all problems in Middle East: “The Arabs are moved
         by only two considerations—fear or money. What you should do is to buy them off. For two
         million dollars you could have done as much in Lebanon as you do much more expensively with
         an entire fleet.” Dulger says the same reasoning applies to all other Arab states. Public
         opinion in Iraq, for example, he dismissed as non-existent, but repeated his formula, force
         and funds.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Greek Catholic Archbishop Nabaa: This prelate is subtle, intelligent and very
         well-disposed toward the west. He has recently returned from a visit to Lourdes, Brussels
         and Rome. Unlike the Turkish Ambassador he felt Lebanese solution must involve issues of
         principle and that next president must be a man of probity and good character. He thought
         Jawad Boules was candidate who would come closest to filling the bill.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church, Saleeby. This staunch old prelate is
         extremely pro-American and proud of the fact there are more than 4000 of his relatives
         living in the US. He is coming to Washington next year on a leader grant and, as Embassy
         has pointed out, has his miter in the ring to become the next Greek Orthodox Patriarch of
         Antioch with headquarters in Damascus. Saleeby, whose congregation is the next largest to
         Maronites among Christians of Lebanon and which he says contributes 40 percent of all tax
         revenues to the government, pledged support of Greek Orthodox Lebanese for any presidential
         candidate US would indicate.</item>

         Arabic, I met these two “moderate” leaders of opposition at a neutral house. They were
         fervent in professing friendship for the west and the US but insisted their quarrel was
         only against <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. In consequence, they deplored
         US landing. Their view of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and how his
         relations with US had covered gamut of ups and downs was very much as might have been
         described by Cairo Radio. They were frankly astonished when I set the record straight on
         our dealings with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> over recent years. They
         professed desire to see insurrection ended and US forces depart. Their hatred of <persName

         events. An indication of incredibly fragmented political structure here is that he called

         as appalling. Significantly Moslem Mufti had come to his house for asylum. Bishop indicated

         insurrection, is now concerned largely with saving his own skin. However, for the record,
         he protests our landing and had in his pocket a telegram for <gloss target="#t_SC1"
          >SC</gloss> protesting it as a violation of Lebanon sovereignty. He seemed, however,
         willing to be persuaded when we pointed out errors in this conclusion, and volunteered to
         withdraw his telegram. Pharaon impressed me as an intelligent twister who wishes to hedge
         his bets and to come out on willing [<hi rend="italic">winning?</hi>] side.</item>

      <p>In addition, I saw entire Latin American diplomatic corps last night at residence as
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> has arranged weekly briefing of the
       Latinos, much to their delight. This is a give more than take proposition.</p>
      <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0421"/>
      <p>One thing which struck me because it is only unifying through [<hi rend="italic"
        >thought?</hi>] in all these interviews was agreement on imperative necessity of holding
       presidential elections soon. Whether center, opposition or extremely loyalist, all were in
       agreement on this point. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in our last
       conversation told us he felt confident parliament could convene before end of this month and
       succeed in electing a president who, he thought, would be able to carry out this pro-western
       foreign policy.</p>
      <p>We were impressed yesterday evening by a new sense of confidence in <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He said several times, “My mind is now at ease because
       I know independence of Lebanon is saved.” He seemed very sure of himself in stating he
       thought a new president could shortly be elected. As for his own returning self-assurance, he
       said as we were leaving that he would still be a power in Lebanon even though he would not be
       president.</p>
      <p>One other general conclusion I draw from these interviews is that increasingly important
       opinion in Lebanon is accepting fact ours is not an occupying force. I also have feeling most
       Lebanese welcome our presence here and feel it will make it possible for them to reach a
       political solution. They are also becoming convinced of sincerity of our statements when we
       say we are not here to impose a president upon them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and we are continuing
       our work on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and his officers to prepare
       for eventual military action against immediate focus of infection in Beirut should that prove
       necessary after presidential elections.</p>

       <item>Conversation between the Secretary and Foreign Minister De Murville regarding a Summit
        Conference</item>
      </list>
      <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0422"/>
      <p>In a telephone conversation with Couve de Murville on July 24, the Secretary said that we
       were not anxious to be stampeded into a high level meeting with the Soviets. He said that
       while our approach was somewhat different from the French, basically we were not far apart.
       He wanted De Murville to know that our next reply will tend to slow down the movement toward
       a meeting. He noted that we did not want to see it rushed, although the British did.</p>
      <p>De Murville said that he did not object to the idea of a meeting but not under the
       conditions set by the Soviets. If the meeting could be arranged calmly and not so soon, he
       thought it would be all right.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that, although we were expressing our position in a somewhat different
       manner than the French, we basically share their view that the meeting should not be arranged
       in great haste. He said we did not think anything should happen for two or three weeks or
       perhaps longer, but we certainly did not want the meeting to take place within the next few
       days. He said we planned to suggest that the Permanent Representatives at the United Nations
       should discuss the question and see if there is general agreement on this kind of meeting
       and, if so, when and where it should be held.</p>
      <p>De Murville said that this was fine and repeated that they did not want to be rushed. The
       Secretary said that we might have to take account of the views of the British. De Murville
       said he understood.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that Alphand would report our position in more detail.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d228fn2">Dulles also discussed the Soviet proposal for a Security Council heads of
        government meeting with French Ambassador Alphand on July 24. Alphand stated that France was
        firmly opposed to a conference within the framework of the United Nations. The French
        Government was particularly opposed to New York as a locale in that the “theatrical”
        atmosphere of the United Nations would give <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
         >Khrushchev</persName> a unique propaganda platform. Alphand added that <persName

       shades of opinion. Purpose of visit from <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       point of view was to sound out his latest idea on presidential elections. President said that
       following <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s social meeting with <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>’s staff described <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"

         >Ibid.;</hi> included in the microfiche supplement)</note> General had spent some hours
       with him in a frank discussion of what to do next both politically and militarily.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> explained his thought by saying re all
       candidates now under discussion as potential presidential timber, they suffered from
       fundamental risk of not having army support during very delicate days ahead for Lebanon. He
       had previously urged <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to accept presidency under
       circumstances when <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was much more popular than
       today. Now, however, especially among Christian community, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>’s stock had fallen to a new low. On Moslem side also, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s admission of US landing force had decreased his
       popularity. Notwithstanding, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> thought <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> would still be best president for Lebanon because he
       could insure military support for which another president might have to go begging. <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> seemed sincere in stating his concern was for long-range
       future of Lebanon rather than for immediate local political advantage.</p>
      <p>From these considerations President thought only way to rehabilitate <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s reputation was for him promptly to win some military
       success either in the Basta or in the Chouf. President reverted to idea he had suggested to
       Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> on Monday (<gloss
        target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 568)<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3"><ref target="#d207"
         >Document 207</ref>.</note> for US forces to be deployed near Syrian frontier, thus
       releasing sufficient troops of Lebanese Army for a decisive action. He proposed an immediate
       meeting between ourselves, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and
       General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to discuss possibilities.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> pointed out we were not canvassing for any
       particular candidate so long as Lebanon could find itself a president and end its protracted
       crisis. However, there were persuasive arguments as President had outlined and certainly we
       would have no objection to <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0424"/><persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> if his number should come up. We had been considerably
       encouraged by degree of progress made in collaboration between <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and his staff with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName> and his entourage.</p>
      <p>On question of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s staff, <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he was well aware of possibility that if <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> became president he might promote Colonel
        <persName>Salem</persName>, present Chief of Staff, to position of Commander-in-Chief.
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s antidote for this would be to arrange, once
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> were president-elect, to appoint a completely
       new Commander-in-Chief with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s acquiescence, the
       new commander to clean out old staff and set up more reliable one.</p>
      <p>We are not immediately acceding to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       suggestion because we wish to try out his proposal on Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName>. Off-hand our judgment is that following warnings to opposition
       outlined <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 649<note n="4" xml:id="d229fn4">In

        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to be able to deploy forces either to compress Basta or
       to attack in Chouf. However, on eve of elections we are inclined to doubt political wisdom of
       latter course. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> cannot resist feeling
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> wants still that “military victory" for which
       he has unsuccessfully clamored throughout 21/2 months of civil war.</p>
      <p>Subsequently to dictation of foregoing, I have consulted with my French and British
       colleagues. We agree on following points: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>It would be a capital mistake to undertake military operation against Jumblat in the
         Chouf since this is unnecessary from military point of view, would be counter-productive in
         arousing enmity of Druzes, and in any case is needless since once a new president is
         elected, we are confident Jumblat will speedily make his peace.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Ambassadors feel it is necessary to take measures to neutralize or if necessary reduce
         the Basta. Yesterday there was a brisk fire fight around British Embassy residence while my
         French colleague was lunching with my British colleague. Firing did not subside until 6
         p.m. We all concur, however, that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has
         sufficient military resources, backstopped by presence of American forces, to accomplish
         neutralization of the Basta.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>British and French Ambassadors concur in <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
         >Murphy</persName>’s idea there is much political benefit to be gained from suspension of
         military curfew in Beirut. All three Ambassadors feel it would be highly useful if curfew
         could be lifted on day Parliament meets for presidential elections provided Basta situation
         has previously been dealt with.</item>
        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0425"/>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>All three Ambassadors concur (more in sorrow than in anger) that given list of
         possible presidential candidates, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s analysis
         is right: That <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> by and large would be best
         president in light of unsavory alternatives if he is not chosen. One more argument favoring
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is that he alone among candidates would be
         immune from charge of being imposed on Lebanon by American bayonets.<note n="6"

         >Goodpaster</persName> on July 25, and concluded that to limit the agenda to Lebanon and
        Jordan “would result in our appearing solely in a defensive role.” It would be better to
        discuss the entire range of problems in the Middle East, as well as the underlying causes of
        the problems. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi><persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

       the French were being very difficult; that they seemed to be backing out and wanted to come
       back to the Geneva idea. He said he would like to try to calm the French by asking Couve de
       Murville to London on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that our reply<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">See <ref target="#d230"><hi
          rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> had been sent and that we had made some changes in
       it. He said he thought the French would be willing to go along if the arrangements for a
       meeting could be made in a little more measured way. He said he had talked with De
        Murville<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">See <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> and
       that the French felt arrangements were being made with too great haste and were also worried
       that they might get into a discussion of the Algerian question. He thought also that General
        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was probably averse to leaving France at
       the present time. If we could make arrangements for a meeting date two or three weeks hence,
       the Secretary thought it might be all right. The Secretary referred to the <pb n="395"
        xml:id="pg_395" facs="0427"/>last paragraph of our letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> and said he thought the French would be willing to go along on this
       basis. He saw no reason why the French would not be willing to allow the Permanent
       Representatives in New York to work out the date, duration, agenda and other details of a
       meeting. This would not commit anyone to have a meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"

        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>. We called on President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning at his instance to consult with him and
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> regarding the proposition that <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> made yesterday that it is essential that there be some
       sort of military success by Lebanese forces.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">See <ref
         target="#d229">Document 229</ref>.</note> This would be designed to improve chances of a
       favorable political solution on July 31, to augment the authority of the Lebanese Government
       and would be in the interest of the prestige of the US forces in Lebanon.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> made lengthy “appreciation of situation”
       pointing out there were in his military opinion two alternatives before us: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>There could be a widely stepped-up military action against rebels which would have to
         be accomplished largely by US forces as in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
         opinion Lebanon army would break up and certainly would not cooperate in such a wide-scale
         operation. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> predicted that any energetic
         movement against rebels either in Basta or elsewhere would provide a nationwide reaction
         among insurrectionists and predicted within 24 hours after such an operation were mounted,
         there would be vigorous rebel response in Tripoli, the Hermel, the Bekaa and the
         Chouf.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>Second alternative was for Lebanon army by its own means to conduct a modest plan of
         operations helped by presence in Beirut area of very important American forces. <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said instructions had been given to commence
         operations seeking to reduce area of the Basta <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0428"
         />commencing at 1400 today. (The Basta is a central, Moslem district in the heart of
         Beirut. Its control by insurgents is perhaps one of the most humiliating features of the
         present government situation.) His plan calls for a sort of nibbling action employing not
         more than a company and a half of troops at any given point (he says he has a battalion and
         a half in Beirut) with object of pushing insurrectionists back upon themselves, of
         preventing harassment at present by rifle and grenade fire on government buildings, and of
         making it impossible for rebels in Basta to continue their present threat to public
         security in the city.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was very firm in stating he could not with
       his own means contemplate a reduction of the Basta. This was true not only because of
       insufficient forces but more particularly because his hybrid army of Christians and Moslems
       would break apart. He said repeatedly, “I have a very brittle instrument in my hand. If I
       strike too hard, it will break”.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> inquired if it might not be
       possible for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to augment his very scant striking
       force in Beirut if US forces should relieve Lebanese troops now in static lines. Although at
       first he seemed dubious, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> finally agreed this
       should be possible and mentioned what a help it would be if 40 or 50 troops now maintaining
       guard on Tapline terminal could be brought to Beirut, being replaced by US forces.</p>
      <p>On general plan of campaign in civil war, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       said he had initially been faced with two alternatives: <list>
        <label>(a)</label>
        <item>To deploy his six battalions (550 men each) along Lebanon frontier in hope of
         preventing infiltration from Syria.</item>
        <label>(b)</label>
        <item>Deploying his forces on internal lines, which he had done, and which had pegged them
         in fixed positions.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>It was agreed by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and ourselves that contemplated plan of operations initiated today
       against Basta, even though it did not contemplate taking entire area, would have salutary
       political effect prior to elections scheduled July 31. We also agreed it essential that such
       action be taken at once if position of our own forces in respect to public opinion here and
       elsewhere were not to be jeopardized as well as for need to reinforce respect for authority
       of Lebanon Government.</p>
      <p>Upshot of a two-hour interview in which President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> took minutes of the meeting were following three conclusions: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Starting at 1400 today, Lebanon army would commence its operation to curtail size of
         Basta but not to take Basta.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>US forces would so far as possible replace Lebanese forces in static positions.
         Lebanese troops thus relieved would be used in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>’s striking force to be used against the Basta or elsewhere.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>US to respond affirmatively for Lebanon military request for matériel. This would
         include equipment for psy war, such as loudspeaker trucks, teargas, and other necessary
         arms or munition.</item>
       </list></p>
      <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0429"/>
      <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> added a fourth point that as this
       was a police action, there should be cooperation to improve psychological warfare
       efficacy.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was emphatic that a joint operation by
       American and Lebanon troops would bring about the immediate dissolution of his army as an
       effective instrument.</p>
      <p>It was finally agreed Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> would in
       person at 10 am tomorrow present General Adams to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>, who in turn would give instructions to his staff for immediate
       cooperation in setting forth above program. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> and
        <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> will call at 11 am tomorrow on <persName

      <p>In light USG position re dispatch troops Jordan he had asked Rifai prepare alternate
       proposal which he would now present. Rifai began by saying both he and King realized request

       unfavorable repercussions: <list>

       </list></p>
      <p>I pointed out it was these same reasons which caused my government doubt wisdom sending US
       troops Jordan plus fact heavy concentration US land/sea/air power Lebanon area made any
       external aggression against Jordan virtually impossible. Rifai said main concern
       Hussein/himself was not external aggression but internal security <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
        facs="0430"/>which although now satisfactory might change under <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s heavy propaganda attack aided by money agents infiltrated from <gloss

       knows street mobs by themselves cannot effect successful coup, must have cooperation
       army/security forces. While majority Jordan Army loyal there are some dissident elements
       particularly among company grade officers. Hussein/RIFAI greatest fear is occasion when army
       may be ordered fire on mob and refuse. When this happens government is finished, chaos
       results, army junta favorable <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will take over.
       Even if internal security maintained Jordan is now embattled island <persName

       latter consolidate position. [<hi rend="italic">51/2 lines of source text not

      <p>In order achieve foregoing objectives at same time clear country foreign troops Rifai with

       formal request my government soonest.</p>

      </list>
      <p>Hussein outlined advantages plan saying two new brigades recruited among loyal tribesmen
       would strengthen internal security force to point where foreign troops would not be required
       and British brigade could be permitted depart. Expansion Jordan Army would make substantial
       contribution its morale, same time afford economic benefits by creating employment nomadic
       tribesmen hard hit by this year’s drought.</p>
      <p>A US/<gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> defense treaty would have tremendous psychological
       effect by demonstrating to people Jordan US determination stand with Jordan against enemies
       which surround it. Creation <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>/Jordan would permit
       American military come, be seen but in role partners working within framework Jordanian
       defense establishment not as “occupying force”.</p>
      <p>Creation Middle East regional defense organization would permit grouping Arab as well
       non-Arab states which would have benefit pooling military potential major powers free world
       with strategic geography Middle East.</p>
      <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0431"/>
      <p>Hussein asked my opinion proposal. I replied expansion army meet country’s internal
       security requirements instead relying foreign troops had considerable merit as did idea
        US/<gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> mutual defense treaty including establishment a
        <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Jordan. Re regional grouping <gloss target="#t_METO1"
        >METO</gloss> it involved wide-range political/economic as well as military considerations
       which I did not feel competent comment on although basic concept well illustrated in similar
       organizations such as <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
      <p>I took opportunity in line increasing number of countries granting recognition new Iraqi
       Republic sound out Hussein/RIFAI their reaction should US in company other free nations feel
       obliged follow similar policy on grounds we better able serve legitimate interests our
       friends if we enjoy diplomatic relations new government. [<hi rend="italic">31/2 lines of

      <p>As I was about leave Rifai said wished make point re <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName>’s proposed summit meeting Security Council which heads of state
       including those Middle East would attend. Rifai requested I inform my Government King Hussein
       would insist on attending any such meeting in order to properly present his country’s case
       before Security Council.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I know from earlier conversations Rifai that
        he/Hussein/<persName corresp="#p_TB2">Talhuni</persName> have made painful reappraisal
        <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> policy requesting foreign troops. Proposal advanced by
       Hussein/RIFAI my opinion holds certain advantages USG on assumption we wish retain Jordan as
       free-world fortress in Middle East at least until situation clarifies extent longer range
       policy objectives can be determined. No doubt it will cost us considerable amount money but
       at least under proposed set-up we would be in position know exact status Jordan security
       forces with additional advantage exercise some direct supervision over military assistance we
       provide. My opinion by refusing be pushed into dispatching US “occupation" troops we have
       gained opportunity establish MAAG/Jordan something which heretofore has been dismissed by
        <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> as impossibility. In view Iraq toward which Jordan has
       in past looked for military support vis-à-vis Israelis now “on other side”. Expansion Jordan
       Army by two brigades does not seem unreasonable. Furthermore it can be used as device
       reassure Israel which has taken position it must strengthen its own security forces due to
       encirclement by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, since two additional brigades
       in light present conditions cannot be construed as posing military threat Israel. Plan has
       further advantage of having Jordan as far as internal security concerned defended <pb n="400"
        xml:id="pg_400" facs="0432"/>by Jordanians rather than ourselves or British. [<hi

         responded, in telegram 747 from Beirut, July 27, that the Department’s ideas with respect
         to the direction his efforts should take corresponded with his own thinking. He felt that
         he and the Embassy staff should continue to press for presidential elections to be held on
         July 31. That would allow him to leave Beirut on July 30, and he suggested an itinerary
         which would take him to Amman, Tel Aviv, Beirut, Baghdad, Ankara, Beirut, Cairo, and London
         before returning to Washington. Turning to the Department’s other observations concerning
         Lebanon, Murphy noted that there was no intention to initiate U.S. military action against
         insurgents in the Basta. Such action would only occur in the event of extreme provocation
         endangering the security of U.S. forces. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>
         added that he and the Embassy staff had been “plugging" the line of strengthening <gloss

         independence, but the response had been mixed: “from extreme cynicism in case of <persName

        >Chamoun</persName> this morning at President’s request. He said (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
        >Embtel</gloss> 698)<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2"><ref target="#d232">Document
        232</ref>.</note> that as he had half anticipated General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> had not moved against Basta despite assurances given to Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and ourselves yesterday. General now claims he will
       commence operations some time this afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       said that following our interview yesterday he had implored <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> “to act like a man”; and indicated to us this morning that he would not
       make up his mind definitively re pushing <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> for
       presidency before Monday. He still hoped general could somehow generate sufficient
       determination to undertake military action against the Basta before that time, but it was
       clear <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> viewed prospect with immense
       skepticism.</p>
      <p>President said there was further intelligence of Syrian intervention. He claimed he had
       received word at 10:30 last night of Syrian penetration close to Tripoli. Troops in uniform
       had been identified wearing Arab headdress instead of Syrian peaked cap, and a tank, he said,
       had been located at Tripoli airport. We asked if he had immediately communicated this
       intelligence to <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> smiled contemptuously and said they were so ineffective it would not
       have been worthwhile.</p>
      <p>We agreed that since neutralization of Basta is largely a police action, it might prove
       useful if gendarmes should compose striking force with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> to backstop it by armor and artillery. Failing that, at least Admiral
        <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> might consider taking up with his forces
       certain guard positions now held by gendarmes with view to releasing them for police action
       against Moslem insurgent quarter. We shall discuss these possibilities with <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> shortly.</p>
      <p>We discussed with President contents <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 487<note

       repeated London 1040 and found <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> unhappy but
       resigned at first three paragraphs thereof. I gave <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> careful account of my talk yesterday with Jumblat (<gloss
        target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 715)<note n="4" xml:id="d235fn4">In telegram 715 from
        Beirut, July 25, <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> reported that he had met in
        the Chouf with Druze opposition leader Jumblatt. Jumblatt was strongly in favor of prompt
        elections for president, but skeptical that such elections would take place while U.S.
        forces shored up <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s position. <persName
         corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> concluded that Jumblatt did not contemplate aggressive
        military action, and recommended against the military operations which <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had been pressing for in the Chouf. He felt that
        Jumblatt, like most other Lebanese political figures with whom he had spoken, would be
        thankful if the crisis could be resolved by an internal solution. (Department of State,
        Central Files, 783A.00/7–2558; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> and said we
       also from our own observation <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0435"/>concurred in feeling
       it would be unwise to move against Jumblat in present circumstances (<gloss
        target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 487). <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said
       he disagreed because he was convinced eventually military action would have to be taken in
       the Chouf, but he would accept our views at present.</p>
      <p>In closing, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said we need not worry about
       elections next Thursday. Once his own mind was made up (and he still favored <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> if latter could be brought to action), he felt it would
       be possible for decision to be taken in Parliament July 31.</p>
      <p>After seeing <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>, we hope to have another
       talk with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d235fn5"><persName

        met with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> that evening and found him again
        unwilling to take military action against the Moslem opposition force in the Basta. To do
        so, he argued, would lead to a renewal of rebel activity and postpone the presidential
        election. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> added that he felt <persName

      <p><gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 4. Re Amman 272.<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2"><ref
         target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note> Following are our preliminary comments on King
       Hussein’s proposals for recruiting two additional brigades, mutual defense agreement between
       US and HJK, and new regional defense organization.</p>
      <p>As Wright says, proposal to create two additional brigades might have advantages if we
       desired to maintain Jordan as Free World fortress in Middle East. However, we do not believe
       it would be in US interests to attempt to do this and in fact we would be happy if some way
       could be found for us to disengage ourselves from our responsibilities <pb n="404"
        xml:id="pg_404" facs="0436"/>in Jordan with minimum political disadvantage. Under
       circumstances it would seem to us undesirable to become involved in further heavy
       commitments, especially since it seems almost certain that sums we would be required to
       provide to accomplish Hussein’s purposes would be substantially greater than the $8 million
       he mentions when consideration is given to annual maintenance costs, effect on Jordanian
       budget of maintaining two additional brigades, etc. It is also by no means certain that
       existence of two additional brigades would prevent coup against King.</p>
      <p>On other hand, until we can see more clearly how situation in the Middle East is going to
       develop, and because of fact that our prestige is heavily engaged in Jordan, we are probably
       required to continue to extend considerable degree of support to Hussein. Although it would
       seem inadvisable to agree to equip two additional brigades, it might not be too
       disadvantageous to sign a military aid agreement (not a mutual defense agreement) with Jordan
       whereby a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> would be established in Amman and some
       additional training and equipping of the Jordanian army undertaken by us. This would not,
       however, establish rationale for withdrawal <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces. We
       regard it as highly unlikely that a number of the states proposed by Hussein would be willing
       to enter into suggested Middle East regional defense organization and we of course do not
       believe that Baghdad Pact is “finished” as a northern tier defense agreement. Accordingly, we
       believe that Hussein should be discouraged from further consideration of this proposal.</p>
      <p>We were encouraged by Hussein and Rifai remarks concerning recognition of Iraq which should
       prove useful background for your conversations in London.</p>
      <p>Essential thing for Jordan as we see it is that there be eventual political adjustment
       whereby Jordan, perhaps with some manifestation of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> interest
       in protecting it against indirect aggression, would cease to be “embattled island in
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> sea.” We should be working to achieve this,
       not to build up Jordan’s isolation from Arab world.</p>
      <p>Defense requests foregoing be brought to attention Sprague.</p>

         concluded that he and <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> agreed that “we need
         urgently to find more effective machinery for joint planning—military, political, economic
         and psychological—to face this risk, if the Soviets reject our <gloss target="#t_UNSC1"
          >UNSC</gloss> proposals.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,6 Presidential Correspondence: Lot
         66 D 204) Both documents are included in the microfiche supplement.</p>
       </note> In ensuing discussion they suggested that if not joint planning at least planning
       liaison would be desirable. As British idea presented in rather general terms, Secretary said
       he would study question on basis written exposition which <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
        >Macmillan</persName> undertook to send him. Some hours later following letter received from
       Prime Minister: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“July 27, 1958. Dear Foster:</p>
        <p>Our talk at luncheon clarified my mind a great deal. This is how I see the position. If,
         in spite of the French complication, the Russians accept a meeting of the Security Council,
         then I think it unlikely that desperate action will be taken by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> or the new Iraq Government to precipitate a crisis in the Middle East.
         We might look for a few weeks’ pause before any further serious trouble develops–such as a
         coup in Jordan or a move against the Western interests in the Gulf.</p>
        <p>If under one pretext or another the Russians decline a meeting this will mean that they
         have decided to hot up the cold war in the expectation that they will gain more from this
         than from a temporary pacification.</p>
        <p>If the first happens and there is to be a meeting in a fortnight or so, we must work out
         together, with great speed and concentrated effort, both a short-term plan for Lebanon and
         Jordan and a longer-term plan for the Middle East generally. It may well be that we shall
         not be able to make much practical progress with our longer-term ideas at this first
         conference; but it is most important that we should be seen to be taking a liberal and
         forward-looking view and should not appear merely to be concerned to protect our own
         Western interests.</p>
        <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0438"/>
        <p>If, on the other hand, there is no conference, the cold-war pressures will be
         accentuated. Just, therefore, as the State Department and the Foreign Office should be
         working together on a political plan for the conference, so we should also be engaged in
         intensive joint planning (mainly on the military side) for the second situation in case it
         should arise. I am not suggesting that we should undertake any fresh commitments at this
         stage, or that any operations we may have to undertake should necessarily be joint
         operations. But we ought to make sure that each of us knows what the other has in mind, and
         that all our plans, whether joint or separate, fit together.</p>
        <p>I am quite happy about the machinery for political consultation and planning. For we
         [are] well accustomed to working together either through normal diplomatic channels or
         through the special machinery in Washington. (I confess that I am not so happy about the
         military side. Ought this to be concerted in Washington and, if so, by what machinery? Or
         ought it to be done through Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
         >Holloway</persName>—either at his advance headquarters, or at his rear headquarters in
         London? Perhaps, as there must be a substantial political element in all this, it would be
         best done in Washington. You will know best. But that it must be done, and urgently done, I
         am sure you will agree.)</p>

       forces.</p>
      <p>Although it must have caused him a hard struggle, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> this morning stated he had at last agreed that warrants for arrest of
       opposition deputies would be placed in suspension to permit them to vote next Thursday. We
       applauded political wisdom of this decision and said further we hoped non-parliamentary
       opposition leaders such as Jumblat, <persName>Yafi</persName> and Oueni would likewise have
       warrants temporarily suspended in order to permit them to consult in Beirut with their
       political leaders.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> asked us urgently to impress on <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> need for more resolute military action at least to
       curtail rebel activity in Beirut and possibly to repulse what he described as significantly
       increased rebel movements in north Lebanon near and on hills northeast of Tripoli.</p>
      <p>We propose to request Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> to give us
       a careful military study of situation in these areas and to arrange meeting between <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>’s staff, General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and ourselves early tomorrow <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0440"/>to
       go over possibilities of some military action prior to elections. Now that <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has accepted candidacy he is in a different position as
       if parliament makes him president he will be facing the same issues in a new light.</p>

      <p>819. From <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> for the Secretary. Yesterday we ran
       into a series of complicating developments which we are trying to resolve on the spot. As you
       undoubtedly know, there was an attempt at assassination of Prime Minister <persName
        corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> yesterday a.m., he narrowly escaped death by a matter of
       seconds as a result of terrorist bomb attempt which killed six people. Naturally he was
       shaken and emotional. This has precipitated a crisis in the Lebanese Government which
       involves General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>For over a week <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> has been telling me that
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is really the only possible presidential
       successor, and day before yesterday he confirmed that he would support <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> who had accepted to be a candidate. He implied that this
       was the government’s viewpoint.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, after lunch yesterday, in a high state of emotion resulting from that
       morning’s attempt on his life, <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> in the presence of
        <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
        >McClintock</persName>, Adams and myself, poured out a stream of invective against <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. He said there would be a special meeting of the Cabinet
       yesterday afternoon which would result in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
       dismissal and the dismissal of a number of officers on the General
       <persName>Staff</persName>. He blamed <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> for the
       development of the crisis during the past months, calling him a traitor. He even became
       bitter in his reference to American forces standing near with folded arms and doing nothing.
       He wanted to know whether, as he said <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had told
       him, the US had insisted that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> be the candidate
       and that we would accept nobody else.</p>
      <p>As dispassionately as possible I told the Prime Minister that we regarded with amazement a
       situation where he as the responsible head of government over a period of months has been
       unable, according <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>to his own admission, to effect
       dismissal of officers of the General <persName>Staff</persName> whom he has considered
       disloyal and ineffective throughout the period of the rebellion. According to his own
       statement, he and his government have been unable to dismiss the commanding general whom he
       considered disloyal. At the same time the President of the Republic has told us for days that
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is the only possible candidate for the
       presidency. According to <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName>’s own admission, his
       government has authority over only a fraction of the territory of the country—perhaps as
       little as a third of the area. He now addresses the question of us whether, if his government
       acts to remove General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and members of the
       General <persName>Staff</persName> and there is a violent reaction on the part of the
       Lebanese Army, we would defend the present government by attacking the Lebanese Army with our
       forces.</p>
      <p>I emphasized that we had been if anything too careful to refrain from supporting one
       candidate as against another. Only in reply to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
       >Chamoun</persName>’s question did we indicate we would have no objection to <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as President. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> had recommended it. This frankly is an impossible situation and I said I
       would give a negative answer to his question. In fact, I said as a personal opinion that we
       would prefer to remove our forces from the area.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> agreed and informed <persName
        corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> US forces would not be used as suggested by <persName
        corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName>.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> traced the history of the development of
       the present situation and the reasons for the despatch of our forces to the Lebanon.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> emotionally said, “Very well, I will resign and
       leave the country.” We deprecated this but did not urge him not to resign.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
        >McClintock</persName> agree with me that present government does not possess adequate
       authority to govern. Prolongation of the political crisis will cause further deterioration
       and give encouragement to terrorism. In that case, some form of coup d’etat becomes
       increasingly probable. If that happens, a military group would probably spearhead it.</p>
      <p>Thus we conclude that whatever safety there is for us in this precarious situation lies
       with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and his military establishment such as it
       is.</p>
      <p>We are informed by <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> that parliamentary election
       of a new President is impossible under these conditions. Yet postponement may produce chaos.
        <persName corresp="#p_SS5">Solh</persName> has espoused an early election before yesterday’s
       attempt on his life. Now he is in full cry against it and declares that loyal members of the
       Parliament will not attend.</p>
      <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0442"/>
      <p>For their part, opposition are not being helpful. They have issued a manifesto denouncing
       elections unless both <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and Americans go. In this
       stormy situation I plan to see <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and possibly
       speaker of Parliament before leaving this afternoon for Amman.</p>

        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> called this morning. He had been detained by Patriarch
       who told him in his estimation much of manifesto from opposition described <gloss
        target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 806<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">In telegram 806 from
        Beirut, July 30, the Embassy reported that opposition leaders had met at the home of
         <persName>Saeb Salam</persName> and issued a 15-point manifesto outlining the demands which
        would have to be met to ensure their participation in a presidential election. Included in
        the manifesto was a demand for the immediate evacuation of all foreign troops, and a demand
        for the resignation of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and the formation of a
        cabinet approved by the opposition. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/7–3058;
        included in the microfiche supplement)</note> was window-dressing for the Basta mob.
       Patriarch persuaded <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> of his ability to secure a
       written promise from opposition that after elections (presumably for <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>) they would commence to lay down their arms and
       rebellion would end.</p>
      <p>Although Speaker of Parliament Osseiran has been insistent that election should take place
       tomorrow, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> feels they should be deferred by one
       day until August 1. This would make it possible for five rebel deputies, against whom
       warrants for arrest are outstanding, to consult with other opposition leaders as well as
       moderate politicians and thus be prepared for a vote on Friday. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> says that if necessary Lebanese military will give physical protection to
       these deputies and other opposition leaders. He adds that after we see Rashid Karame this
       morning, Karame has an appointment to confer with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> who will later receive Jumblat and endeavor to work out a general
       agreement with moderate opposition leaders for elections on Friday.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d241fn4">August 1.</note></p>
      <p>General intends to see <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning and
       “insist” (for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> an unusual word) on foregoing
       program.</p>
      <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0443"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said explicitly in presence of Admiral
        <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> that he would not request departure of
       American Forces until military aspects of rebellion had been reduced and contained. We feel
       there will be no difficulty with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> with regard to
       an abrupt demand for removal of our forces. In fact, arrangements which have been slowly
       perfected for a cordial working relationship between American and Lebanese military will be
       an additional assurance against precipitate action of that nature.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is now on his mettle. He feels <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and Lebanese Government have been trying to use him as
       cat’s paw and he is now determined to show who in fact has the whip hand. In consequence, we
       believe that despite last-minute maneuvers and protestations on both sides, there is a
       reasonably good prospect of election on Friday which will produce <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> as next President of Lebanon.</p>

        >Malik</persName> asked me to see him this evening prior to final Cabinet session at 6 p.m.
       to go over latest developments on tomorrow’s elections. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"

       palace: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had spent part of morning with a large
         group of loyal deputies. He found great disagreement among them and opposition to his
         proposal that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> be elected president. Effect of
         yesterday’s dynamite attempt on Prime Minister was everywhere apparent. At last President
         told deputies that if they did not accept his advice meet tomorrow and elect <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, he would himself resign his office. Shaken by this
         ultimatum, deputies apparently agreed with great reluctance to follow President’s
         bidding.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, with whom <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
          >Malik</persName> had a brief conversation, indicated he was now ready to accept the
         presidency but hoped for as large a vote as possible as easing way for re-establishing
         national unity. He also said he thought <persName>Sami Solh</persName> Cabinet should
         resign to be replaced by a government of “technicians”.</item>
        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0444"/>

        <item>While <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was talking to <persName
          corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>, <persName>Sami Solh</persName> arrived at palace and
         raised a fearful scene in adjoining hall, screaming at top of his voice that <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was a coward, weakling and imbecile, whom he would in
         no circumstances accept as president of Lebanon. With some difficulty Prime Minister was
         quieted down and hustled off to a tense Cabinet meeting which lasted for two hours.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>At meeting of government attended by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>,
          <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said wide dissatisfaction was displayed toward
         American attitude. It was apparently believed we had sat by with folded arms while
         situation in Lebanon had deteriorated; and that we were pushing <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> as a candidate. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         complained according to <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> Americans were letting
         it be known that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was his (<persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s) candidate. Upshot of meeting was general agreement
         best solution would be to press for a military solution of rebellion with all possible
         means. This would, in <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s words, mean “maximum
         cooperation on all sides including the American.”</item>
       </list></p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he had been requested by Cabinet to get my
       reaction. I pointed out notion of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> candidacy was
       one which President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had volunteered to
        <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> and me. At no time have we indicated a
       preference for any candidate although we did honestly feel that Lebanon’s political agony
       would not be eased by letting the present situation drag on and possibly deteriorate. I also
       recalled a condition of our forces landing here was that Lebanon army would continue to fight
       and that there be fullest cooperation between Lebanon armed forces and our own. I added that
       we were perfectly confident of our ability to assist Lebanon to maintain its integrity and
       independence; but for US forces to be involved in a civil war while Lebanon forces were not
       fighting was a matter calling for very serious consideration. I then pointed out that in all
       objectivity situation of Lebanon Government had not changed since insurrection commenced on
       May 8: The government was powerless to enforce its decisions. It depended for its instrument
       of force upon the Lebanon military and General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
       >Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>I was then asked to confer with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s company. I found President affable and relaxed in
       contrast to his Foreign Minister. In fact for first time in all these months I had impression
       I was now speaking to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> when he had at last
       reached “the moment of truth.”</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said more for <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName>’s benefit than mine that there was no other candidate than <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> if only because he controlled the armed forces.
       President said he was not bluffing when he had threatened his resignation to the deputies. He
       still thought it best to hold elections tomorrow and for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> to be elected. He did not, however, wish to dismiss <persName>Sami
        Solh</persName> at once but would prefer to have some days elapse before a way out was found
       for the Prime Minister.</p>
      <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0445"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> at this point said to President that he
       completely concurred in my analysis: That throughout the rebellion Lebanon Government had in
       fact been impotent. Their fate depended on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and he had not wished to carry out dictates given him.</p>
      <p>He exclaimed, “we are confronted by a coup d’etat a la Libanaise; <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has contrived to take power.” To this <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> dissented saying that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> had not planned events but they had developed of their own momentum. He
       said wryly, “this all began ten years ago when we isolated the army to keep it out of
       politics. It became a state to itself and it is now coming into constitutional power.”</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> expressed worriment over foreign policies which
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> might follow. I said in my judgment climate of
       international opinion was now propitious for Lebanon to be given some sort of international
       guarantee which would settle the course of its foreign policy advantageously to Lebanon. I
       thought President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could play a useful role in
       few months remaining before end of his term in expediting events toward some form of
       international guarantee which might save Lebanon not only from its enemies but—perhaps more
       difficult—from the Lebanese themselves.</p>

       why US had found it unwise to send forces. He was grateful to British for their immediate
       response. He stressed point British had come to protect constitutional regime and not just
       the persons of himself and Rifai.</p>
      <p>I said at times there might be reasonable differences of opinion as to methods of achieving
       goals. We believe US forces in Lebanon plus <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces in
       Jordan have had beneficial regional effect. Hussein agreed and said perhaps this adequate for
       time being. He left no doubt that without arrival of both forces in area his regime would
       have probably suffered same fate as Iraq. He asked many questions regarding Lebanon and
       expressed doubts regarding <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>We discussed Jordanian armed forces with our interlocutors emphasizing the touching
       fidelity to the person of Hussein of the Bedouin officers and men. Hussein urged our support
       of recent requests for US aid to arm and equip two additional brigades, total of 8000 men. I
       said I was sure this would receive active study. I was very sympathetic but avoided anything
       savoring of a commitment.</p>
      <p>We discussed <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> propaganda. They offered full cooperation
       and joked about past difficulties in raising Radio Jordan from 50 to 100 kilowatts. I
       informed them of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s personal
       interest in improving our output in area. They agreed it should be improved on an urgent
       basis. They said Jordan in the heartland of the Arab world. [<hi rend="italic">11/2 lines of
        source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName> mentioned rumors re abdication of Hussein.
       This evoked indignant denial and repeated references to loyalty troops. It also aroused
       contemptuous references to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a liar and rogue
       parading as Arab leader. Egyptians are not Arabs said Rifai. In the end <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would not force the issue with Israel but would yield.
       They said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is a bluffer. As any demagogue he is
       dependent on momentum and words. In the end <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       would fail ignominiously.</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (51/2 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>Reference to question recognition of Iraq aroused emotional objections by both. It would be
       regarded as reward for Bolshevik brand of brutality. How could civilized nations deal with
       murderers, et cetera? At time of conversation I had not received word regarding Department’s
       decision to recognize shortly. Therefore <persName corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName> and I
       were noncommital.</p>
      <p>Subsequently Rifai dined alone with Wright and me. On subject Iraq recognition and in reply
       to <persName corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName>’s questioning he blandly said, “well, we
       meant you should not recognize right away, perhaps in a month or six weeks.” Rifai is a
       realist I believe and is aware of the trend in several countries including US.</p>
      <p>In this conversation Rifai asked me to inform Washington: <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415"

      <p>My brief contact convinces me that Jordanian situation is fragile and unpredictable. [<hi

         ><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was elected President of Lebanon by the
        Lebanese Parliament on July 31. He received 43 votes on the first ballot in the Chamber of
        Deputies, which was one short of the necessary 2/3 majority, and was elected on the second
        ballot with 48 votes to 7 for Raymond Edde. (Telegram 861 from Beirut, July 31; <hi

        a personal message of congratulations to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> on
        July 31, noting his expectation that close and cordial relations would continue between the

       as I had no wish to talk shop; but <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was clearly
       eager to do precisely that. He made following points: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>General has been under very intense pressure from various political elements including
         moderate groups as well as opposition for an immediate public declaration calling on US
         forces to withdraw from Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he
         refused to issue such a statement. He did wonder, however, if it might not be possible for
         United States (and he hinted a statement would have greater impact coming from President
          <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>) to make declaration indicating that
         with improved security <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0448"/>situation in Lebanon, it
         would presently be possible to re-embark our troops.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3"><persName
           corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> also reported, in telegram 867 from Beirut, July
          31, that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was opposed to any increase in the
          strength of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> group in Lebanon, and anticipated
          requesting the departure of the observation group almost simultaneously with the
          withdrawal of the U.S. forces. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
         320.5783A/7–3158)</note></item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> indicated he was also under great
         pressure from opposition for immediate departure from Lebanon of President <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. I recalled to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> his consistent attitude that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> should finish out his constitutional term of office and indicated we
         had taken a similar line discussion with the press. I also made point which I thought would
         not be lost on a new President-elect that it would be a bad precedent for <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> or any other constitutionally elected Chief of State
         to be compelled to resign before end of term. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
         agreed but expressed suggestion that possibly <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         might wish to make a trip abroad while still remaining legal President of Lebanon until
         September 23. He said “he had heard it said" that possibly <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> might be invited to the United States. I indicated I had no knowledge
         of such a proposal.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>In any event it was clear that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has made
         up his mind <persName>Sami Solh</persName> government must go. He said vote in Parliament
         this morning indicated that Cabinet itself was split right down the middle. Following this
         morning’s elections, he found it difficult to believe that present government could
         effectively continue in office. At one point General hinted that possibly if <persName>Sami
          Bey</persName> should depart from Lebanon, it might be a sufficient sop to opposition to
         enable him to resist demands for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
         departure.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>On formation of a new Cabinet, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> indicated
         his preference for workmanlike group of technicians but admitted he would presently run
         into difficulty with professional politicians and people with their own axes to grind. He
         likewise expressed doubt that it would be easy for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> to contemplate participation in a new government of various opposition
         members who <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought might usefully serve in
         new Cabinet.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>On opposition demand for general elections, I was relieved to find <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> still firmly of opinion that it would be disastrous to
         dissolve Chamber and hold elections. He said with passions so heightened by recent events,
         it would be impossible to contemplate this possibility for a long time to come. I
         emphatically agreed.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>General expressed hope US would be able to help Lebanon by financial and matérial
         assistance. He cited destruction of roads, bridges and buildings due to civil war and
         financial straits of <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>. On military account he hoped he
         could continue to look to US for supply of certain matériel. His only specific request,
         however, was that certain arms of French manufacture which were included in next year’s
         budget and <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0449"/>which were essential to Lebanese <gloss
          target="#t_TO1">TO</gloss> and Es might possibly be purchased with US funds. Total amount
         was small, in neighborhood of between 3 and 4 million Lebanese pounds.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item>On over-all situation following election, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> said he expected civil war would rapidly peter out. He had some
         information indicating that Tripoli might open tomorrow. It would take a few days longer
         for resistance in the Basta to fade away, but was following example of General <persName
          corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in leaving rear doors open for enemy to
         flee.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>As for recrudescence of Syrian-Egyptian infiltration again in Lebanon, <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he thought it would be some while before
          <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> undertook any new adventures against this
         country. He had it from a number of Moslem sources that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> had been very much shaken by swift and effective American military
         intervention in Lebanon.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is exceedingly
       friendly and willing to use his prestige to insure most practical arrangement of future
       relations with United States. However, he will, as he indicated to <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> and
       me yesterday, feel compelled by public opinion as well as by his own military estimate of
       situation to ask for our withdrawal once it is clear military aspects of insurrection have
       been dealt with. I believe his suggestion for a voluntary statement on our part is evidence
       of his desire to accomplish our eventual withdrawal by most tactful means. I took pains to
       tell General this was already within framework of previously established US policy and cited
       statements of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Ambassador
        <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in that regard. However, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> continues to feel some additional declaration from US
       would obviate necessity on his part for making a public request for our withdrawal.</p>

        election to express his admiration for <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
        patriotism and ability to put the welfare of his country above personal and partisan
        interests. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said that the vote that morning had
        been taken “in an air of national mourning”, but he had convinced his supporters that there
        was no practical alternative to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. <persName

         <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> suggested that <persName

      <head>245. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on July 31 on significant world developments
       affecting United States security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered
       the following assessment of developments in Lebanon and Jordan: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence has said the Parliament of Lebanon had held a
         meeting and elected General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as President of
         Lebanon. Two ballots were required. On the first, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> did not receive the required two-thirds majority; on the second, which
         did not require a two-thirds majority, he received the votes of 48 of the 56 Deputies
         present. Ten Deputies had been absent, including the Prime Minister, who had been out of
         his head since the attempt to assassinate him, and would probably resign soon.</p>
        <p>“The President asked whether the Prime Minister had been shell-shocked during the attack
         on him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that the Prime Minister
         had not been physically harmed, but that he had received a terrific mental shock.</p>
        <p>“Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the election of
         General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was probably the most favorable
         result under the complicated circumstances existing in Lebanon, particularly since the
         opposition had voted for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. However, the
         election had not settled all the affairs of Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> had not shown much decisiveness in the last few days. This might be due
         to a natural indecisiveness in the face of a crisis; or it might have been a deliberately
         clever play of the cards, designed to secure greater support in the election. Some time
         back, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had been <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName>’s candidate. Accordingly, we would expect closer ties between Lebanon
         and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
         might not hold office long. As a result of his election, the immediate crisis would
         probably subside, fighting would cease in most of the country, and Lebanon would get back
         on its feet economically.</p>
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then noted that the situation in
         Jordan remained acute. It was hard to see how the regime could survive if and when U.K.
         forces retired from the country. The withdrawal of U.K. troops would probably be the signal
         for the collapse of the King, who does not enjoy sufficiently popular or Army support to
         remain in power when not held up by U.K. forces.” (Memorandum of discussion at the 374th

        British troops in Jordan and concluded that airlift support should continue as authorized by
        Israel until August 6, after which the British could sustain their forces by sea from Cyprus
        through the <persName>Suez Canal</persName> to Aqaba. Since the British had already
        demonstrated the capability to transit the canal under British flag, there appeared to be no
        necessity to accede to the request for U.S. transport.</note> This memorandum, I believe,
       presents a better picture than I had anticipated. I am particularly glad to note that you
       have been able to send two ships through the Canal and that we have been able to airlift such
       a large quantity of supplies to Amman. The fact that one of your ships appears to be a
       commercial vessel is particularly good news for it is in line with the President’s view
       expressed in his message of July 23<note n="5" xml:id="d246fn5"><ref target="#d222">Document
         222</ref>.</note> that it is preferable to use commercial vessels as much as possible in
       that area.</p>
      <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0452"/>
      <p>The only point that has been left open is the request that we continue a small airlift of
       one or two sorties a day from Cyprus to Amman after the major airlift draws to an end around
       August 6. Our military are reluctant to undertake such a general commitment and I am
       concerned over the Israeli clearance problem. Up to now the Israelis certainly have been most
       helpful, but you will recall that it was only with considerable difficulty that I was able to
       get the clearance “for a few days”. <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> is,
       moreover, under considerable pressure on the question of overflight clearances and I do not
       see how we can guarantee the continuance of this airlift. We of course would reexamine the
       matter should the situation make it imperative to do so.</p>
      <p>I also note that there is some feeling here that our assistance in this area should be
       coordinated at one point. An informal working committee that has been established with your
       Embassy in Washington and which meets once a day to handle the <gloss target="#t_POL1"
        >POL</gloss> problem for Jordan seems to have done an excellent job. I would suggest that
       this ad hoc group extend its work to include these other matters relating to our assistance
       in supplying your troops in Amman.<note n="6" xml:id="d246fn6">Dulles also addressed a letter
        to <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> on August 2, transmitted to London in

      <p>891. During my call this afternoon on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
       >Chehab</persName>, he said he informed President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> this morning that his immediate program involved two fundamental
       objectives;</p>
      <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0453"/>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>A new government must be formed forthwith. Parliament by its act yesterday had
        repudiated Prime Minister <persName>Sami Solh</persName> who had politically opposed
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s election and in consequence, a new cabinet
        was necessary. He said that although <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> made no
        commitments and was preoccupied with finding a formula how to let <persName>Sami
         Bey</persName> out without loss of face, he had impression that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> as a practical politician would agree to a change in government.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Next problem was the Basta. General could now no longer tolerate Basta continuing as a
        focus of infection. Revolution there should have to be eliminated by one means or another.
        However, he was hopeful insurrection could be terminated through negotiations. He said
         <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>, self-styled “Commander-in-Chief”, had become “tres sage”
        and was seeking to have a talk with the General. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> hoped therefore revolution in all parts of country might speedily come
        to an end.</item>
      </list>
      <p>General again raised possibility of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> “taking a
       trip” (vide paragraph 2 <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 869).<note n="2"
        xml:id="d247fn2"><ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note> I referred to Secretary’s
       press conference yesterday in which he had alluded to possibility of Lebanon and Jordan being
       represented at <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> “summit” meeting August 12.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d247fn3">For the transcript, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
        >Bulletin</hi>, August 18, 1958, p. 269.</note> I wondered if possibly President <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> might attend this meeting as head of state. At first
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was hesitant, saying Moslem element in country
       would be deeply suspicious of leaving it to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to
       discuss an international guarantee for Lebanon. However, upon reflection he said he thought
       it might be possible provided <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> were accompanied
       by representative Moslems as members of Lebanese delegation. It was clear General quickly saw
       possibilities of getting <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> out of the country in
       rapid course but with necessary political safeguards for his action in New York.</p>
      <p>Reverting to question of declaration from US on withdrawal of US forces (<gloss
        target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 869), I observed to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> it was a fortunate coincidence that yesterday Secretary in his press
       conference had said “whatever our views may be, we would not stay in Lebanon after we had
       been asked to withdraw by duly constituted Government of Lebanon.” General said this was
       exactly what he had in mind and was very pleased at tenor of Secretary’s remarks. I left with
       him translation in French of pertinent excerpts and requested he have his staff give him
       resume of entire press conference<note n="4" xml:id="d247fn4">For the transcript, see <hi
         rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 265–272.</note> from wireless file text.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I am much encouraged by change in General’s attitude during
       past few days. This is the first time in almost three months he has on his own initiative
       talked in a determined way on eliminating insurrection from the Basta. He is also warming to
       his new responsibilities. In particular, he is heartened by a new vigor and pride in all
       ranks of Lebanese Army which he said with glowing eyes “is now the <pb n="422"
        xml:id="pg_422" facs="0454"/>old army as it used to be.” With his increasing confidence and
       assurance of unified support from armed forces, I have feeling <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> will bring an end to insurrection quickly.</p>

      <p>On August 1, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> replied to
       Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s July 28 letter. Again, he took
       exception to the premises underlying <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
       characterization of the intervention of U.S. and British forces into Lebanon and Jordan as
       aggression. The intervention occurred, he argued, as a result of indirect aggression against
       small countries in the Middle East which had to turn to the United States and the United
       Kingdom for support to preserve their independence. To discuss this problem, <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> indicated that he was prepared to participate in a
       heads of government meeting of the members of the Security Council. He proposed August 12 as
       the date for the meeting and agreed that it could take place outside of the United States,
       but added that he could not agree to a meeting in Moscow in light of the mass demonstrations
       and violence which had occurred at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on July 18. The text of this
       letter was transmitted to Moscow in telegram 214, July 31, for delivery on August 1.

      <p>581. From <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. On my return from Jordan and
       Israel I have read carefully the several Deptels regarding <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       activity and plans in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>First of all I would like to stress that in my opinion actually there is no “friction”
       between <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>, the Embassy and Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>’s command. To the contrary it seems to me there is
       an admirable cordiality and mutual desire to work together. Naturally the initial shock to
        <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>’s staff of the sudden arrival of a large US
       fighting force required adjustments both in operations and attitudes. All parties concerned
       deserve credit for intelligent cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
        >McClintock</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>, Galo Plaza,
       General <persName corresp="#p_BLGO1">Bull</persName> and their associates and I have enjoyed
       many contacts, daily discussed mutual problems frankly and have been, I think, mutually
       helpful. I hope <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> will emphasize this to
       Hammarskjold and <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>, I believe, is puzzled as to the future.
       Sometimes in this kind of situation there may be a tendency to develop unconsciously a vested
       interest, to institutionalize.</p>
      <p>My own preliminary thinking, for what it is worth, would be in the direction of reduction
       rather than an increase in the personnel of <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>.</p>
      <p>My reasons are: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Belief that the new Lebanese Government will hope to develop its own control of the
         situation. There is certainly a fair prospect of its success. Newly elected President
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, I am sure, is determined to achieve
         control. If he succeeds, a large <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> establishment in Lebanon
         would not only be unnecessary but unwelcome and controversial. The key to control, I think,
         is the ability of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> now to stimulate Lebanese
         armed forces and gendarmérie to act and to bring about a reconciliation of elements which
         will reduce opposition to government control. Lebanon control of its own destiny obviously
         should be promoted if it offers reasonable hope of success.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Lebanon is flooded with clandestine small arms and explosives. It continues afflicted
         by terrorists. This situation has arisen from both domestic and foreign causes. Its
         correction, I am convinced, can be best effected by <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>.
         Pernicious foreign interference can be reduced and eventually eliminated by determined
          <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> action coupled with a national union type of
         reconciliation. From my talks with <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0456"/>principal
         opposition leaders I am convinced they intend to cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>. Already this morning there is news that Druze leader Jumblatt is
         requiring his followers to turn in their arms at Mouktara.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>With development of cooperation of opposition leaders, effective police action, a system of
       rewards and penalties to suppress terrorism and collect arms and explosives, the reasons for
       a large <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> establishment would begin to disappear. Clandestine
       and foreign radio agitation would be reduced. I think we should lend encouragement to <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>, giving it to understand that it has the primary responsibility
       to establish law and order. Such policy, I believe, will be far more palatable to the
       Lebanese. Proposal to establish a large <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force in itself is
       a declaration of lack of confidence in Lebanon’s ability to bear its proper responsibility.
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, I am sure, would like a chance to demonstrate
       ability to cope with the problem. With temporary presence here powerful US military force, we
       can encourage and support him to do so. Such support and encouragement are especially
       important in the initial stage until the authority of <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> in
       the country is reestablished. The beginning is the critical period. After that, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s authority will be more easily accepted by the
       disparate elements making up this complex little country.</p>
      <p>So I come to the conclusion that with any luck it may be possible in the near future to not
       only withdraw US forces gradually but to avoid a heavy <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       build-up. I am confident <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> would not desire presence of a
       more or less permanent and large <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> contingent any more than
       it would wish indefinite continuance in Lebanon of US military forces.</p>
      <p>I believe that <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> substantially share foregoing views. On return to
       Beirut and before departure I would like to supplement this with additional comment relating
       to form of guarantee of Lebanese independence and integrity.</p>

      <p>Lord Hood called under instructions to discuss the continuing requirement for the build-up
       and supplying of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces in Jordan. He said that in the

      <p>It was suggested to Lord Hood that if this were done it would be less provocative if the

      <p>Lord Hood asked whether he could inform the Foreign Office that the US would support the

       would be getting awfully close to war. The Secretary would think about the matter during his

        in the overflights. (Department of State, 785.00/8–258; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> The Secretary said that it was particularly shocking that Israel would do
       this without any consultation with the US. We had believed that Israel fully agreed with the
       US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> purpose in Lebanon and Jordan of showing the Soviets
       and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> there was a point beyond which they could
       not go. If Israel had now changed its mind, we would like to know. There were wide political
       implications in giving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a sense of power in the
       Middle East by such subservient actions as Israel seemed prepared to take.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d251fn3"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had discussed the Israeli
        decision to halt the overflights with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> that
        morning. “I said that the broad implications of this were perhaps more serious than the
        immediate impact on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces in Jordan, although the latter
        was important. I noted that this might require the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to send
        reinforcements via the Suez Canal, and that this in turn might raise serious problems.”

      <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> said that Israel was deeply concerned
       over the malevolent power of the Soviet Union which could destroy Israel in five minutes. The
       Prime Minister’s decision was based on the belief that the additional British request for
       overflight permission involved the sending of additional troops into Jordan which were an
       added convenience but not crucial for the support of the British operation. Israel felt that
       by now the British should have been able to make other arrangements to get these forces into
       Jordan. Israel lacked a formal security guarantee from the US and felt itself in a most
       poignant position.</p>
      <p>The Secretary stated that the Eisenhower Doctrine made clear that the US would come to the
       support of Israel should it be attacked by a Communist power. For future guidance we wanted
       to know whether Israel felt so menaced by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that it
       would do whatever the Soviet Union requested.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador said he would at once transmit the Secretary’s important observations to his
       government. Israeli general fortitude could not be questioned, he thought. The Secretary said
       he was sorry he had had to speak so bluntly, but important issues were at stake.<note n="4"
        xml:id="d251fn4">On August 5, the Israeli Government reversed itself and authorized the
        resumption of the U.S. airlift to Jordan. Israel asked only that the United States initiate
        consultations to find an agreed arrangement to bring the flights to an early conclusion.
        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName> stressed, in conveying this message to
        the Department, that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName> did
        not want to leave the impression that Israel had bowed to Soviet pressure. Israel had not
        answered the Soviet note, and when it did, would reject the contention that U.S.–U.K. action
        in Lebanon and Jordan, and Israel’s cooperation with the overflights, were aggressive.

      <p>On August 5, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> addressed the final
       letter to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in the series of
       exchanges which began with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter of July
       19 proposing a five-power summit conference to discuss the Middle East. In his August 5

        >Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> repeated his
       arguments concerning the responsibility of the United States and the United Kingdom for the
       crisis in the Middle East, but switched the thrust of his proposal to a call for an emergency
       session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly to discuss “the question
       of the withdrawal of troops of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> from Lebanon and
       troops of Great Britain from Jordan.” <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0462"/><persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the Security Council had become
       subservient to the United States and did not represent a proper forum for such a discussion.
       For the larger questions of war and peace, he proposed that preparations begin for a separate
       summit conference of the great powers to “facilitate the creation of trust and mutual
       understanding between states and aid in a more rapid thawing of the ice of ’the cold war’.”
       Similar letters were addressed on the same day to British Prime Minister <persName
        corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and French President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
        Gaulle</persName>.</p>
      <p>The text of the letter to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was conveyed to
       the Embassy in Moscow on August 5 and was transmitted to Washington in telegram 336, August
       5. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1/8–558) Copies of the three letters were sent to
       the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Secretary-General and were circulated to the members
       of the Security Council on August 5 as <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> doc. S/4079. The

      <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s proposal was received in Washington as
       an opportunity to seize the initiative on the issue in the General Assembly. Assistant
       Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> recommended in this vein to
       Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> shortly after
        <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter was received. (Memorandum from

       Lot 65 D 30, Special Meeting—1958) <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> concurred
       from New York, and proposed that the United States seize the initiative at the outset of the
       emergency session by introducing a resolution which would contain a positive proposal to meet
       the constructive aspects of Arab nationalism. (Telegram 218 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
        >USUN</gloss>, August 5, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Central Files, 396.1/8–558) Herter
       called <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Brazil at 6:40 p.m. to get his
       response. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt that, while the United States
       was not bound to accept the Soviet proposal, it should welcome a General Assembly meeting and
       not be afraid of it. (Eisenhower Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
       Paper, General Telephone Conversations; included in the microfiche supplement)</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s discussion that afternoon with British
       Minister Lord Hood revealed, however, that the British were concerned about a General
       Assembly session called to consider Jordan and asked the United States to delay in responding
       to the Soviet proposal. (Memorandum of conversation, August 5; Department of State, Central
       Files, 320/8–558) <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> raised the British concern
       in a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> shortly thereafter, but
       the recommendations from <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, <persName
        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName>, and
       the public release of the letter by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
       combined to dictate a quick public response if the United States was to seize the initiative
       at the United Nations. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> also felt that,
       since the United Kingdom had the right under its treaties to go back into Jordan, the British
       government would not be embarrassed in the <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0463"/>General
       Assembly. (Memorandum of conference with the President, August 5; Eisenhower Library,
        <persName>Whitman</persName> File, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>

      <p>Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> responded to <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter by releasing a statement at 7:30 p.m. on
       August 5 in which he welcomed <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s agreement
       that the problems which had been under discussion in the exchange of correspondence should be
       placed before the United Nations. He expressed regret that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
        >Khrushchev</persName> had rejected discussion in the Security Council, but added that a
       meeting of the General Assembly for the purpose of the discussion was completely acceptable.
       He was instructing the United States Permanent Representative to the Security Council to
       request such a meeting. For text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
        Documents, 1958</hi>, page 1002.</p>
      <p>Permanent Representatives <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and
        <persName>Sobolev</persName> each introduced resolutions in the Security Council on August 6
       calling for an emergency special session of the General Assembly. (U.N. docs. S/4056/Rev. 1
       and S/4057/Rev. 1, respectively) The Soviet resolution called for consideration of the
       question of the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon and U.K. troops from Jordan,
       but the Security Council on August 7 adopted the United States resolution which simply made
       reference to the lack of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council, and
       called upon the General Assembly to assume responsibility for the maintenance of
       international peace and security with respect to the questions at issue. (U.N. doc. S/4083;
       all of these resolutions are printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

        >Lodge</persName> reported on August 6 that the British position with respect to a special
       session of the General Assembly “had come around completely,” and that the British now hoped
       that the General Assembly meeting might create conditions which would enable them to withdraw
       from Jordan. (Department of State, Central Files, 320/8–658)</p>

      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> indicated that for time being at least he and

       problem of collecting arms with which Lebanon now saturated. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> likewise said he was convinced even leaders of Moslem opposition did not
       desire withdrawal of US forces until peace had been restored although, as a sop to their mob,
       they had to make public statements clamoring for our departure. I had certain impression from
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> he will not want removal of our forces or make
       any form of request in that direction for some time to come. In response to my question he
       said he would be willing to concert with Adm. <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName> on a possible phased reduction in our troop strength.</p>
      <p>Queried as to his attitude on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he thought they might have a practical role to
       play, particularly in assuaging fears of Christian element when US troops begin
       reembarkation. He thought <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer force might usefully
       stay on a while longer after period of US withdrawal. He seemed to have no precise thought
       one way or another on possible build-up of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer
       strength.</p>
      <p>Queried as to nature of government he would seek to form after taking office, <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he wanted an inconspicuous government made up of
       people truly devoted to trying to heal wounds and restore national unity. He made a quiet
       point in describing the characteristics he sought in a new Foreign Minister being a man who
       would not only understand the Arab world and relations with the occident but who would also
       have roots at home and understand his own people.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was explicit in his thanks of US intervention
       both military and political. He was kind enough to say that without my efforts here elections
       would not have taken place and although he expressed regret he was the man chosen, he left no
       doubt in our minds that he intended to do his duty and to carry out that duty in his own
       way.</p>

       discuss this matter with him in context of importance for Jordan and from viewpoint security
        <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> of preventing further deterioration in Jordanian situation
       and explosion there which might shatter present uneasy truce in Palestine area. You could say
       that whatever may be differences between <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Jordan, or
       between US and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> regarding Jordan, all parties genuinely
       interested in security <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> would seem have real interest in
       seeing that security in these critical times is not further endangered by developments
       arising out of Jordanian situation. People of Jordan and refugees in that country should not
       suffer hardships because of differences of views between governments, and such measures as
       closing of borders and interruption normal travel and commercial arrangements are likely lead
       to creation of atmosphere in Jordan which may produce the explosion which we believe it so
       desirable avoid.</p>
      <p>We realize Jordan has severed relations with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and has
       applied restrictions on entry into Jordan. We would be prepared urge upon Jordan Government
       the relaxation of these restrictions to degree believed consonant with security of Jordan,
       and would hope that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could see its way clear permitting
       relaxation of restrictions applied from its side with view to reducing to greatest extent
       possible interference in normal commercial interchange between Jordan and its neighbors and
       reducing harmful repercussions of present situation in lives of citizens of Jordan and
       refugees located there.</p>
      <p>Our approach on this matter arises not only from our concern over effects within Jordan of
       violence resulting from continuation of present situation, but also from our belief that such
       a development could not be confined to Jordan itself. It seems to us that maintenance of
       stability in Jordan is essential to continuation of present relative calm in Arab-Israel
       situation which precarious though it may be, has not involved large-scale hostilities. We
       believe it in interests of everybody concerned that necessary steps be taken to prevent
       creation of a situation which might result in such hostilities. Realize foregoing line <pb

      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on August 7 on significant world developments
       affecting United States security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered
       the following assessment of developments in Lebanon and Jordan: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported that the Lebanese rebels were
         pushing toward a victory involving withdrawal of U.S. forces and the exile of the
         President-elect. Guerrilla activity, but no serious fighting, was taking place. <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> still intended to serve out his term, but might change
         his mind in exchange for an important post abroad. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> appeared relaxed, and was not pressing for withdrawal of U.S.
         forces.</p>
        <p>“The situation in Jordan had not improved, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
          >Dulles</persName> reported. Syria had closed its frontier, cutting Jordan off from land
         contact with the outside world, a development which could have serious effects in the
         future. At present, the supply situation was somewhat easier— although <gloss
          target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> remained close—because Israel had relaxed its opposition to
         overflights. The financial situation in Jordan was so bad that the money-changers would
         take dollars only at a discount. There was growing talk in Jordan that the King should
         abdicate. The British took a grim view of the situation, and believed that Jordan’s fate
         would be decided in the next thirty days.” (Memorandum of discussion at the 375th Meeting

      <p>993. Joint message Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and
       Ambassador. Pass <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.
       We called this afternoon on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to discuss
       his view on a possible symbolic withdrawal of some element of US forces from Lebanon. It
       seemed to us this would have political advantages both from limited Lebanese point of view
       and from the aspects of US policy. From aspect of Lebanese political situation, opposition
       forces would find themselves undercut since they had so vigorously clamored for US withdrawal
       and would now find that US by voluntary agreement with Lebanese Government and
       President-elect was in fact initiating such a withdrawal.</p>
      <p>From wider aspect of US policy objectives, it seemed to us there would be advantages if a
       symbolic re-embarkation commenced prior to convening of special session <gloss
        target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. It would likewise go far to disarm criticism of US by
       Russian and Cairo Radios over alleged “intervention”.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was quick to see these advantages and
       said he agreed with idea in principle. However (so far has he come from his original attitude
       toward landing of US forces), he very much hoped we would not make more than a token
       withdrawal but would leave bulk of our forces intact in Lebanon until peace and security of
       country had been assured. General also said he could use concept of a token withdrawal as a
       bargaining point with opposition. He did not want “to give them this free.” General said he
       had some hope of being able to form interim government of non-political figures, and
       evacuation of our forces might be used, possibility as bargaining point in arranging for such
       a government. However in general, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> concurred in
       advantages of a partial redeployment provided our main strength remained here.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, we recommend that discretionary authority grant be given <gloss
        target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1">CINCSPECOMME</gloss> to initiate withdrawal of at least one and
       possibly two Marine battalions if this is concurred in by General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>. We are firmly of belief that a spectacular re-embarkation of one
       battalion across the beaches with attendant publicity if undertaken soon would have
       beneficial political impact both here and abroad. We have a date to meet General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> 1100 hours Monday 11 August to <pb n="438"
        xml:id="pg_438" facs="0470"/>get his final review of situation and recommendation. If <gloss
        target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and State concur, we would propose to commence redeployment one
       battalion early next week.</p>
      <p>Other points discussed with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> may be summarized
       briefly: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Security situation: Although there were many individual acts of banditry, kidnapping
         and arson as well as a certain amount of internecine village fighting, <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he would on the whole discern a distinct
         improvement in internal security. In fact he said he had concluded that situation had
         improved at least 50 percent in last few days. Much of this development he attributed to
         desire of the opposition to end insurrection and return to normal life. Through negotiation
         with various leaders (he named Jumblat, <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> and Rashid
         Karame), he felt there was a general trend toward a return to peaceful conditions. By way
         of example he cited fact that yesterday at his request Rashid Karame had succeeded in
         reopening coastal road from Tripoli to the frontier. He added that Jumblat was sending a
         representative to Damascus to request Syria to keep hands off Lebanon and for <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to cease any further intervention.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><p>Safety of Americans: I told General I was currently reviewing security situation in
          view of my responsibilities toward Americans resident in Lebanon. He said he would not
          wish to give an outright estimate because since <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
           >Chamoun</persName> had not indicated any intention of leaving country while still
          retaining his title as President, he could give no assurance that there would not be a
          recurrence of terrorism. He could see his way more clearly on a final security estimate
          within ten days.</p>
         <p>We then discussed need for liberty for US forces aship and ashore. Admiral <persName
           corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> indicated joint staff planning between Lebanon
          and US forces had come up with an agreed plan for liberty within strictly delimited area
          of Beirut which would be under full joint US-Lebanese military police patrol at all times.
           <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he accepted this in principle but
          wished merely to assure himself that zones agreed upon were in fact of a character as to
          prevent acts of provocation against our people on liberty. We shall go ahead in principle
          with initiating liberty on these terms tomorrow.</p>
         <p>We likewise raised question of curfew and made suggestion that as security situation
          improved stores in Beirut increasingly opened, and idea of shore leave took hold, it might
          be possible to commence a gradual lifting of curfew restrictions. I suggested, for
          example, possibility of making curfew hours less onerous than at present. General said he
          thought this a good idea and made a note of it.</p></item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>Censorship: I told General that although any nation had a complete right to censor
         news, as a good friend of Lebanon all I could say was that present censorship both military
         and civilian was building <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0471"/>up a vast store of ill
         will, particularly in the very numerous and influential foreign press corps in Beirut.
         General took another note, and I plan to follow this further with <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
         >Malik</persName>.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> made a pleasant reference to
         highly effective services of Colonel <persName>Simon</persName>, Liaison Officer with
         General Admams, who is fourth senior ranking officer Lebanese Army, a recent graduate of
         Command Staff School Leavenworth and an officer who might possibly reach supreme command of
         Lebanese Armed Forces. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> fully reciprocated
          <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>’s estimate of
         <persName>Simon</persName>’s qualities.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>It is interesting that <persName>Simon</persName> has informed Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and Admiral there a universal feeling in higher
       echelons of the Lebanese army and public of friendliness toward US. Colonel added reservation
       that too obvious an association with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (which is not held in
       equal high esteem) might seriously jeopardize US position.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> We feel distinct progress is being made with General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as a general and as a president-elect. Would

       sit out convinced that by evening realities would become apparent to <persName

      <p>At beginning of conversation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was ill at ease
       and I thought uncomfortable because of his hasty morning reaction. There was a brief
       reference to “such things will happen” which we shrugged off as unimportant with a tactful
       suggestion we were happy our interpretation conveyed to him earlier proved correct. We also
       referred to constructive and friendly attitude toward <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>

       read excerpts to which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> lent attentive and I

      <p>Conversation opened on rather heavy note when replying to our words of thanks for
       interrupting his vacation plans on our account <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       stuffily said always glad to see anyone who came with understanding of dignity, equality,
       etc. He was even stuffier when he added that after <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
        >Lodge</persName>’s reference to July 18 resolution he had asked himself whether any useful
       purpose would be served by talking to me in friendly fashion while USG was preparing to
       attack him in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
      <p>I said my visit to Cairo was simply another bit of evidence of desire of President
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> to work cooperatively for solution of <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>
       problems which will not only bring peace and stability but better living conditions and
       understanding of US purposes to the area. We welcome his views and ideas. <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> pointed out Hare’s past efforts to convince him
       regarding peace and stability which had he said become stock words.</p>
      <p>I asked whether he was interested in my conversations in Lebanon and other points visited.
       He seemed eager to hear about them and visibly relaxed when he felt he was receiving
       confidential fill in. (Mustapha Amin later said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       had in mind confining to courtesy call but that our forthcoming approach changed his
       mind.)</p>
      <p>Lebanon: I described situation as I saw it, giving reasons US military intervention with
       references to public explanation of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. I
       referred especially to latter’s <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0473"/>July 31 statement re
       withdrawal US forces.<note n="5" xml:id="d260fn5">At his press conference on July 31,
         <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was asked to discuss the conditions under
        which U.S. troops would be withdrawn from Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
         >Dulles</persName> indicated that a number of factors would bear on that decision, but he
        stressed that “we would not remain in Lebanon after we had been asked to withdraw by the
        duly constituted Government of Lebanon.” For the transcript, see Department of State <hi
         rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 18, 1958, p. 271.</note><persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> inquired why US build-up in Lebanon continued. I said “well you are a
       military man and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> has, you will
       agree, a fair amount of experience in that field. When he decided to respond to the urgent
       appeal of the friendly Lebanese Government for military intervention, he was obliged to plan
       it on an urgent basis and to make provision for all contingencies. President <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> is not in the habit of conducting military
       failures.” Beyond Lebanon itself was the problem of possible reaction from other sources. At
       time of Suez we had heard many threats of Soviet “volunteers” etc. We did not pretend to know
       what Soviet reaction would be to this test. Soviet reaction thus far had been a revelation to
       me personally and I thought <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> also might have
       learned something from the operation. (He agreed with a smile that he had.) I said I was sure
       that he understood how a military pipeline operated once an operation had commenced, and the
       extent of the logistic features. Much equipment, administrative, medical items now necessity
       would continue to flow even after the primary purpose of the operation had been achieved as I
       firmly believed they had been in present case. He should relieve his mind if he entertained
       anxieties which Cairo press seemed to manifest over “aggressive” US intentions in <gloss
        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. The foregoing seemed to be well received and led to a detailed
       discussion of Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> demonstrated he fully
       acquainted with details of Lebanon political situation and personalities.</p>
      <p>He declared <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> fully supports Lebanon independence and
       integrity. He personally convinced it in his best interest for Lebanon remain independent.
       His grievance rested in use of Beirut as center for anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> activity and propaganda spearheaded by <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>. He volunteered opinion that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> because of hostility he had generated on part many Arabs would be well
       advised to take long vacation outside Lebanon. Even the lives of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s children might not be safe. He deplored this but said it was a
       fact.</p>
      <p>For <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> whom he does not know personally he
       expressed respect and even admiration. He recognized the complications of Lebanon political
       and social structure. He would cooperate and there should be no fear he said of evil <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intentions. He preferred to see Lebanon independent but did not
       want it hostile to Cairo. He indicated exaggerated information re US build-up at Adana. Again
       I said we had a strong striking force there because we did not want any risk failure.</p>
      <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said frankly as a military man he just could
       not believe it earlier but was quite willing now to be convinced that US military
       intervention limited to Lebanon. He honestly believed he said we originally intended to
       attack Iraq. I asked him why he thought so and he shrugged his shoulders. He just could not
       believe we were interested only in Lebanon. I said while we had to be prepared for all
       contingencies once operation started, in my personal opinion last thing President <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> desired was to have US forces scattered all over
       area in Iraq, Syria, etc. Flying last Sunday over the inhospitable wastelands which make up
       part of Iraq I was convinced of the wisdom of that point of view. He said he thought unless
       evacuation process started soon he feared danger of incidents involving US soldiers and
       feared we would blame him.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of Iraq.]</p>
      <p>Jordan: This subject became the center of our talk. It recurred several times. I expressed
       concern over the fragility of present position; told <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> something of my impressions during recent Amman visit; Hussein’s
       abhorrence of the Baghdad brutalities and his obvious dread of assassination; Hussein’s
       confidence in fidelity of his army; his statement he would not abdicate and his reference to
       temporary character of British troop presence; the acute political and economic problems;
       Israeli sensitivity. I expressed opinion if <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention
       should occur Israel would attack and that would be situation US could not control. I said I
       thought Jordan at present represents febrile point in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>
       complex. I inquired whether he had any solution in mind which would relieve tensions in area.
       Did he foresee some form of international guarantee of Jordanian independence in which for
       example <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could participate? <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> became grave and reverted to subject several times thereafter. He
       declared we could be assured <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and he especially were not
       promoting an uprising or disturbance in Jordan and did not intend to do so. Jordan is a
       liability and is not viable. He failed to see how Hussein could survive with over 90 percent
       of population opposed to regime and a most adverse economic situation. <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> said he personally abhors assassination and is opposed
       to it as a political means. He understands Hussein’s natural repugnance. He attributed his
       differences with Hussein to latter’s mother who he said blames <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> for overthrow monarchy in Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> said overthrow of Farouk is in itself best example how wrong Hussein may
       be in his confidence in fidelity of army. Plot against Farouk regime had existed for ten
       years in secrecy before it was executed. Same thing was true in Iraq where even <persName
        corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName> Said’s military aide was involved. As suspicious as
        <persName corresp="#p_alSN1">Nuri</persName> was even he was completely caught by surprise
       by the Baghdad coup. Thus he felt sorry for Hussein who was a nice young man in an impossible
       situation.</p>
      <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0475"/>
      <p>He said he really does not know the answer to my question what solution for Jordan would be
       best and promote relaxation of tensions. Anything might happen and he said he is fully aware
       of <persName corresp="#p_BGD1">Ben Gurion</persName>’s attitude. Of course if Israel attacked
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would counter attack. That could be very serious. The
       danger is a source of grave preoccupation. Yet he fails to see how an international guarantee
       can cure an internal situation. At same time Hussein incapable he thought of action to cure
       it. Obviously Hussein cannot recall Nabulsi who is still under house arrest although he
       learns that Hussein considering doing just that. Large numbers of officers and civilians are
       in prison for security reasons. Many others he said daily are fleeing into Syria. He
       complained of scurrilous Jordanian radio attacks on <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
       himself.</p>
      <p>We finally left the subject with my suggestion that if he develops any helpful ideas for
       solution of Jordanian problem which affects his own security much more than ours we would be
       glad to hear from him. He seemed to take kindly to this and to be rather flattered by it.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of a variety of issues relating to the Middle East: Israel, Arab
       nationalism, collective security, arms, Soviet and U.K. involvement in the area, propaganda,
       Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.]</p>
      <p>However, in final survey of situation <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> noted
       that causes for US–<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> conflict might be in process reaction
       as result Iraqi revolution, prospective solution of Lebanese situation and hope for
       improvement <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>-Saudi relations, although Israeli problem of
       course remains and corruption in Jordan could have unpredictable consequences.</p>
      <p>I came away also convinced effective US military intervention in Lebanon may exercise
       excellent effect on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s outlook and attitude.</p>

      <list type="subject">
       <head>SUBJECT</head>
       <item>Special General Assembly and Jordan</item>
      </list>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Special General Assembly</hi>—The Secretary told Lord Hood there was a
       possibility the President might go up to New York and make a general speech to set the tone
       of the meeting. Hammarskjold had suggested this and had also urged that no Heads of
       Government take part and that if the President appeared in New York, it be as head of state.
       The Secretary made clear that if the President should go to New York, it would not be as head
       of delegation and he would not participate in the debate. He said that the decision would in
       large measure depend on whether we found it possible to prepare the kind of speech that would
       justify the President’s appearance in New York.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had applied for a
       visa and that he would therefore probably go to New York and hoped that in the circumstances
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> could come. The Secretary was not sure
       of what extent he would take part in the debate but there would be a great deal to do in
       lobbying with other delegations and some quick decisions might have to be taken.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>—Lord Hood said his government was most grateful for the very
       effective action taken by the Secretary with respect to the Israeli Government. The revived
       airlift would succeed in effecting a much better supply position and he thought that for the
       future the question of overflights would only arise as an ad hoc matter for humananitarian or
       emergency reasons. He reported that a battalion of troops had been moved from Aden to Aqaba,
       which took care of the problem of reinforcement.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood then said that from the British point of view the main objective in the Special
       General Assembly was to get authority for the Secretary General to take action in Jordan. It
       was their hope that a resolution providing for United Nations presence in that country,
       possibly calling for an enlarged <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>, would make possible
       release of some Jordanian troops from the frontier for internal security duties. This should
       provide a breathing space.</p>
      <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0477"/>
      <p>The Secretary thought there was strong reason for United Nations action in Jordan. The
       problem was part of the general Palestinian question for if the Armistice collapsed, the
       Israelis had indicated they would move in. The Secretary pointed to the problem of obtaining
       Lebanese and Jordanian agreement to some form of United Nations guaranteed special status.
       Lord Hood asked whether we were worried about the Israelis and whether they should be warned
       against taking any action. The Secretary replied he was not yet completely caught up since
       his return from Rio but that he saw some advantages in the existence of an Israeli threat.
       Lord Hood said that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> would be in London on
       Sunday to talk with the Foreign Secretary. The Israeli had already raised with the British
       Government the question of guarantees, more arms, etc., and the British Embassy would like to
       discuss this problem with officials of the Department. The Secretary observed that we had
       received a similar request from the Israelis. In this connection, he pointed out that the
       Russians would probably have a proposal on arms embargo which we would have to deal with.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Proposals</hi>—There was a brief discussion of the possibility
       of advancing some proposal for economic development. The Secretary said this raised many
       problems. He thought this might be dealt with in a general way but doubted that we could have
       anything concrete in time for the special session of the General Assembly.</p>

      <p>1017. London for <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. Yesterday I visited Jumblat
       at latter’s urgent request. Meeting took place in the Chouf at a village not far from
       Barouk.</p>
      <p>Druze rebel leader said opposition were disappointed at inability of General <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to persuade <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to form an interim government as a necessary prerequisite to immediate
       pacification of Lebanon. An even greater stumbling block was continued presence in Beirut of
       President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</p>
      <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0478"/>
      <p>Upon questioning it became clear that Jumblat is now prepared to make a deal whereby
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> might leave country in invitation by some
       friendly government or even on an official mission, e.g. to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
       >UN</gloss>, but without necessity of resigning as has been opposition’s consistent and most
       strident claim. At the same time <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would appoint
       a caretaker government to be agreed upon between himself, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and opposition. If these conditions were fulfilled, Jumblat said he could
       persuade other opposition leaders such as Rashid Karame, <persName>Sabri Hamade</persName>
       and <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> to go along and indicated Lebanon could promptly be
       pacified through efforts of caretaker government, General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and opposition leadership.</p>
      <p>I said I had been consistent throughout Lebanon insurrection in stating belief that
       principle should be adhered to of Lebanon’s Presidents fulfilling their constitutional terms
       of office. In consequence, we had always felt <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       should remain President until September 23. As to formation of caretaker government, this was
       a matter of Lebanon’s domestic politics. However, it seemed essential if any compromise were
       to be worked out that one should know identity of Ministers who would make up Cabinet
       successor to present government. Although principles, as Jumblat was first to acknowledge,
       were important, in a country like Lebanon personalities frequently came first. I was certain
       that both <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> would have to know who would replace <persName>Sami Solh</persName> and
       company before President could be asked to consider a mission abroad.</p>
      <p>I gave no encouragement to Jumblat’s suggestion and made it explicitly clear that although
       I was interested in listening to his proposals, US was not a go-between.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> If Jumblat indeed speaks for opposition leadership, his
       suggestions mark a significant shift in opposition attitude. I believe Department should give
       serious consideration to possibility of extending an invitation to Chamoun for an informal
       visit to the US. With such an invitation it is highly possible President might indeed absent
       himself from Lebanon throughout brief remainder of his term. Since it would be <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> who would appoint caretaker Prime Minister, his face
       would be saved and there could be a deal negotiated between <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>, incoming Prime Minister and opposition leaders for prompt pacification
       of the country.</p>
      <p>Key to such a compromise is <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. I should not
       wish to approach him even indirectly (i.e. through <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> or some other Lebanese personality) without knowing Department’s views.
       If I may be so bold as to offer a suggestion, I should say that a friendly invitation from
       President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> for <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> to visit him at Gettysburg would be eagerly accepted.</p>
      <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0479"/>
      <p>It is fairly clear that if some such compromise is not found, Lebanon will continue its
       present hazardous course until September 23 and task of new government in re-establishing
       security and national unity will be made more difficult.<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2"
         ><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> expanded on this prediction in telegram
        1077 from Beirut, August 12. He noted that the situation in Lebanon had grown worse on the
        domestic political front, despite the fact that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> had persuaded the opposition to curtail their insurrectionary
        activities. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> concluded that he was
        becoming persuaded that, unless <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> left the
        country in response to an invitation from abroad, the situation in Lebanon would continue to
        worsen with prospects for the success of the <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
        administration after September 24 becoming correspondingly more difficult. (<hi

      <p>1041. Joint message Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and
       Ambassador. Department pass <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
        >DOD</gloss>. We called this morning on both General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> further to
       discuss question of a token withdrawal of US forces. We had in mind valuable comment set out
        <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 779.<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">In telegram 779
        to Beirut, August 10, the Department responded to the request from <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
         >Holloway</persName> for discretionary authority to organize a limited reduction of U.S.
        forces in Lebanon, outlined in telegram 993 from Beirut, August 7. (<ref target="#d259"
         >Document 259</ref>) The Department indicated that it had in mind the psychological value
        of such a reduction, but was “deeply concerned" to avoid the interpretation that by
        withdrawing troops the United States was giving way before threats from the <gloss
         target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or under pressure applied by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
         >UAR</gloss>. This consideration, the Department noted, was particularly pertinent in the
        context of the special session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> General Assembly.
        The problem was receiving careful and urgent attention. “Regret unable provide discretionary
        authority you request, but will keep you fully advised.” (Department of State, Central
        Files, 783A.00/8–758; included in the microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had given considerable
       reflection to ideas put forth as indicated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 993 and
       had discussed question of withdrawal with leaders of opposition. He had now come to mature
       conclusion that a token withdrawal would be to Lebanon’s advantage. It would for one thing
       help moderate leaders of opposition to bring their more obdurate followers under control. In
       particular, it would undercut Syrian and Egyptian hard core element in the Basta. <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> also had indications that opposition were sending an
       emissary to Damascus and Cairo to make urgent request that <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> cease and desist from further indirect aggression against Lebanon. Given this
       situation, General thought retraction of a BLT would not only serve as a catalyst in bringing
       opposition to terms but would place <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> on the defensive. He
       said if after this evacuation of one battalion infiltration continues, even Lebanese
       opposition itself will begin to ask “who is occupying power?”</p>
      <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/>
      <p>On timing General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he thought it
       important for retraction of a Marine BLT to take place before <gloss target="#t_GA1"
        >GA</gloss> session on Wednesday. He pointed out that if we started promptly to move
       voluntarily after conferring with Lebanese authorities, Russians would not have had their say
       and in consequence no one could accuse us of leaving under threat from <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or under pressure applied by <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 779).</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought it important that there be a
       unilateral communiqué from US side recalling statements by President <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
        >Dulles</persName> on temporary and emergency character of our troop intervention in
       Lebanon. Communiqué could then point out that US forces in Lebanon are presently in excess of
       local security requirements. Communiqué would add that Lebanese and US military authorities
       were agreed that there had been a gradual but steady improvement in international security
       situation. In consequence, withdrawal of a BLT to increase strategic mobile reserve in Sixth
       Fleet was a logical movement and would still leave in Lebanon US forces of such strength and
       firepower as to be fully adequate to requirements of their primary mission; assisting
       Lebanese Government to maintain integrity and independence of the Republic and to protect
       American lives and property.<note n="3" xml:id="d264fn3">Admiral <persName
         corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> sent a message to Admiral <persName

        one of the Marine battalions from Lebanon on August 13. (Telegram 1645 from <gloss

      <p>On security situation <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said that although
       instances of terrorism and banditry would continue for months to come, he was in general
       convinced that nation-wide the situation has materially improved. He cited calm in Tripoli
       which has persisted almost since arrival of US forces; absence of fighting in the Chouf; and
       diminution of incidents even in Beirut. However General admitted that center of insurrection
       is now Beirut and his measures of pacification both by negotiation and use of his armed
       forces would be addressed problem in the Basta.</p>
      <p>We subsequently saw President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and went over
       elements of our conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. President
       concurred that US military resources in Lebanon are currently in excess of their task and
       said he would have no objection to withdrawal of a BLT this week. For President’s comments on
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> situation, see subsequent telegram.<note n="4"

        dictate when the U.S. forces must leave Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> noted that the opposition was violently opposed to <persName
         corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> as a spokesman for Lebanon, and added that he was fearful
        that if <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> was named to head the Lebanese
        delegation, serious trouble would break out again in Lebanon. He conceded, however, that it

      <p>859. From <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. Upon my arrival in London
       Ambassador <persName>Whitney</persName> and I accompanied by Morris and Burdett proceeded
       immediately to Chequers for working tea followed by working dinner with <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
       had with him Ormsby-Gore, Hoyer Millar, Patrick Dean, <persName>William Hayter</persName>,
       Evelyn Shuckburgh, Michael Hadow and Denis Laskey. British representatives questioned me
       closely about my Middle East trip and I gave them full and frank account. In staff meeting
       atmosphere ideas were tossed out and examined. I have tried to indicate below trend of
       British thinking and matters over which they are particularly concerned. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> and his advisers clearly are still in process of
       formulating their position and obviously most receptive to suggestions from us.</p>
      <p>Lebanon—<persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> stressed “it is desperately
       important" for US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to keep together on Lebanon and
       Jordan, not necessarily regarding type of solution but on timing. He said he was thinking of
       need to save Western face. We would look very foolish if six weeks after withdrawal US forces
       General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> chose to join <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. Perhaps neutralization along Austrian lines would be good idea. In 1860 West
       intervened in Lebanon and many Lebanese especially Christians might feel much safer if there
       were some international arrangements now. International convention might be formulated to
       effect Lebanon would not join Western alliance of Baghdad Pact and also would refrain from
        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0484"/>joining any other grouping. This might be
       accomplished by treaty or through agreement of great powers and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. I said I thought this line not entirely foreign to thinking in some quarters
       in Lebanon. I apparently more optimistic than they re <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName>’s ability to bring about reconciliation and his determination maintain
       Lebanese independence. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should be made to sign on dotted line while our troops
       are still in Lebanon and Jordan. (He repeated this several times.) Also we must think of
       Persian Gulf. Neutrality treaty might be good precedent for that area. Once <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had affixed his signature incentive for internal
       agitation to force Lebanon to join <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be largely
       removed. Hoyer Millar commented that Lebanese lacked guts to maintain neutrality on Swiss
       model. Therefore great powers should establish neutrality for Lebanon on Austrian model.</p>
      <p>Jordan—<persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> and his advisers admitted position
       Hussein’s government very shaky. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> supposed
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would like to make Jordan “ward of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss>” for lack of something better. Hammarskjold’s mind seemed to be working in that
       direction. Hoyer Millar reported British Ambassador in Amman has pointed out that <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force would not solve internal problem in Jordan, succeed in
       keeping King on throne or provide economic sustenance.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> emphasized desire of <gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss> to remove troops from Jordan but also to leave something behind when they left.
       If Western response to request for help from small countries failed, West would have “had it”
       all over world. He compared decision faced with that confronted by <gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss> in 1941 when <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> determined to go into Greece
       although decision was military nonsense. [<hi rend="italic">21/2 lines of source text not

      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> made clear he not interested in protecting
       West Bank from Israel for benefit of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.
        <persName>William Hayter</persName> stated he convinced Israel would seize West Bank if
       Jordan collapsed. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> and his other advisers did
       not dissent.</p>
      <p>British representatives doubted <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in such
       circumstances would move militarily against Israel. Further they did not think <gloss

        source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">8 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] It would be terrific blow
       to West if two weeks after British troops withdrew Jordan joined <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. In response to question from Ambassador <persName>Whitney</persName>,
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said would be absolute disaster if US troops
       withdrew from Lebanon before there was some arrangement regarding Jordan. Attacks on British
       troops would immediately start and their position would be rendered untenable. Therefore,
       meanwhile important for US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to give appearance they
       intended to stay on in Jordan and Lebanon for ten years if <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453"
        facs="0485"/>need be. In this case Russians and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> would start working for something realistic. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> had doubts about emphasis given to statements US prepared to leave Lebanon
       when requested by legitimate Lebanese Government.</p>
      <p>Regarding Special General Assembly, <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> and his
       colleagues showed intense preoccupation that upcoming meeting provide “solution”, temporary
       at worse, for Jordan problem. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> asserted “this is
       one time we really do want something out of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>”. He expressed
       opinion there was no chance of obtaining two-thirds vote if Western case is based on
       condemning interference by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName>William
        Hayter</persName> pointed out only justification for requesting <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> action was indirect aggression by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Ormsby-Gore remarked that if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force for Jordan agreed to
       there might be temporary respite. Everyone would be somewhat hesitant over flouting <gloss

       <item>Forthcoming Special Session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss></item>
      </list>
      <p>The Secretary advised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> that the President
       was coming to the General Assembly. It had been arranged that he would speak on August 13, at
       10:30 a.m. after which he would return to Washington. The Secretary then reviewed the latest
       draft of the President’s speech<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">See <ref target="#d269">Document
         269</ref>.</note> with the British Foreign Minister.</p>
      <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0488"/>
      <p>In the course of the review Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> discussed
       briefly a conversation he had had on August 10 with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Robert
        Murphy</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">See <ref target="#d265">Document
        265</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> had been uncertain as to
       whether any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action “neutralizing” Lebanon was necessary.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> felt that it was essential that some <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action with respect to Lebanon’s status be taken, otherwise it
       could well develop that after the departure of U.S. forces and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> observers, Lebanon could be swallowed up. If, in such a case, this action were a
       violation of some sort of a treaty obligation that would be one thing, otherwise, it would be
       a major Western defeat.</p>
      <p>In the course of the review the Secretary pointed out that the speech was more vague with
       regard to Jordan than was the case with Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> felt that there might emerge a common interest in keeping Jordan in
       existence. Perhaps the Egyptians and other elements would not like to see Jordan disintegrate
       at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> reported briefly on a
       conversation he had had that morning with Egyptian Foreign Minister <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> who had seemed to imply that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> did not wish Jordan to accede to it now. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> seemed to feel that perhaps Jordan should be linked with Iraq, then both
       of these states could ultimately come into the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>In discussing that portion of the President’s speech dealing with economic development the
       Secretary pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had been
       consulting with American oil companies. He believed these companies would be willing to
       contribute to an Arab development fund after it had been established by the Arabs themselves.
       The President’s statement that we would support such a fund implied U.S. financial support.
       We felt that such a fund should be operated by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The
       Arabs seemed to get along with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the Russians
       were not members of it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> commented that
        <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> had indicated that Egypt would welcome
       assistance through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but would reserve its right to seek
       bilateral assistance from individual countries including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that after careful consideration it had been decided to omit any
       reference to the Palestine refugees in the President’s speech.</p>
      <p>The Secretary then read verbatim that portion of the President’s speech which dealt with
       possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arms control. It was put in terms of a suggestion
       that if the Near East countries themselves wished the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
       study the arms problem the U.S. would support a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission.
       We had been rather dubious as to this position but had finally decided to put it in. If you
       were able to get a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force in the area, a means of dealing
       with indirect aggression, a mechanism for economic development, then you might want to
       consider disarmament. This was, however, a matter which could raise complex problems.</p>
      <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0489"/>
      <p>A final point in the President’s speech was that the U.S. would continue to support
       national development programs. Regional programs would receive our support should the
       countries directly concerned desire it and if they took the initiative in developing sound
       projects.</p>
      <p>There followed a brief discussion as to whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       would raise the question of Chinese representation.</p>
      <p>The discussion then turned to next steps in the Assembly. The Secretary stated that we had
       a number of draft resolutions but had not yet come to a decision as to whether they should be
       presented. His disposition ran toward suggesting that the Japanese reintroduce their
       resolution on Lebanon.<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4">See <ref target="#d195">Document
        195</ref>.</note> The Secretary made clear that this was a tentative view on his part.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said that British preliminary thinking
       with regard to Jordan was to give the Secretary General fairly wide latitude to arrange for a
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence there and ultimately U.K. withdrawal. In the
       course of this discussion there was general agreement that an Indian draft resolution which
       “called for" the U.S. and U.K. to withdraw their forces or one which “requested" the
       withdrawal of forces would be unacceptable.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> returned to the need for maintaining
       momentum in the Assembly after the President’s speech. He was concerned that a great many
       resolutions might be introduced. The Secretary General’s feeling was that an interim
       resolution or resolutions covering Lebanon and Jordan should be passed authorizing the
       Secretary General to discuss with the governments of Lebanon and Jordan the means of
       expanding the United Nations presence so as to facilitate U.S. and U.K. withdrawal. The
       Secretary General then felt that the Assembly could adjourn for four weeks to resume its
       special session a week before the regular session was due to meet.</p>
      <p>The Secretary inquired if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> felt the
       position in Jordan could be held for four weeks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> said he did not know, that the situation was really “pretty ropey”. The
       King appeared to have a fair measure of support. Admittedly there was a great deal of
       opposition to him, but elements like the Palestine refugees would oppose any government.
       There was a chance that if they thought we would succeed in a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> arrangement for Jordan, the regime would survive. He did not like to leave the
       gap which the Secretary General’s plan would involve, where for a period of weeks there would
       be doubt as to the future of Jordan.</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented that he did not think that more could be attained with regard to
       Jordan than a mandate to the Secretary General. None of us could make a case for a solution
       which the <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0490"/>General Assembly could adopt. The only
       reason for Jordan’s existence was that it was preferable to its non-existence. The state was
       unviable, had a terrible refugee problem and had no tradition or history.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> felt there was just a chance that even
       the Egyptians would prefer Jordan’s existence to its non-existence for a while. The Secretary
       said that the question was that if Jordan collapsed, would the Israelis move in? What was
       important was what the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> thought the Israelis would do. If
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> thought the Israelis would touch off a big war, it
       was doubtful if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would want Jordan. In such a war the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would suffer an initial defeat by the Israelis. The
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would then need aid from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss>. Aid to Israel would be forthcoming from Western countries. The area would be
       off to what would at least be something like the Spanish Civil War.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said that he had spoken to Mrs. <persName
        corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> on the previous day. She had left the impression that if
       Jordan collapsed, Israel would march in. She was concerned at the prospect of Israel taking
       jurisdiction over territory on which 850, 000 Arabs were living and seemed to recognize that
       there would be no prospect of these Arabs leaving that territory. She would be happy if the
       U.K. was remaining on. She had said that the present frontier between Israel and Jordan would
       be tolerable if there were some sort of international permanence in Jordan. The Egyptians
       also might feel they should let Jordan continue to exist. The Russians, however, might behave
       mischievously.</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented that he was seeing <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       at six o’clock that afternoon.<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">See <ref target="#d268"><hi
          rend="italic">infra</hi></ref>.</note> He had nothing particular to say to him but was
       acting primarily to return the courtesy of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s
       call on the Secretary of last October.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> commented on discussions he had had with
       the Secretary General who had said that he already had pretty wide authority with regard to
       Lebanon. As to Jordan he was prepared, among other things, to stretch the authority setting
       up <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss>. Would this give permanence to Jordan? It would
       depend on Egyptian good will. It might last.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> commented that the Secretary General
       would really have to stretch the authority of the <gloss target="#t_UNTSO1">UNTSO</gloss> to
       place it on the border between Syria and Jordan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> said that the Secretary General felt he could do this. He wished some
       vague formulation which he could carry forward for some distance. He did not feel, when he
       spoke to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>, that he could create a new <gloss
        target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Pierson Dixon</persName> reported on a subsequent
       conversation he had had with the Secretary General, who seemed to be developing more
       ambitious plans for Jordan. He was now thinking in terms of something on the order of a new
        <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> with perhaps as many as 4, 000 men <pb n="459"
        xml:id="pg_459" facs="0491"/>in it. He was attracted by the fact that such a <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force would need a supply line through Lebanon and Syria. Mr.
        <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> wished to try out this idea on <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName>. The Secretary General felt that it was to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>’s interest to sustain Jordan’s independence.</p>
      <p>In the following discussion there appeared to be general agreement that Jordan should be
       handled in one stage by the General Assembly rather than the two-stage manner proposed by the
       Secretary General. We might wish to press the Secretary General to drop his idea of recessing
       the special session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. Sir <persName
        corresp="#p_DSP2">Pierson Dixon</persName> said that if it was decided to put a <gloss
        target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> into Jordan, the two-stage operation would be necessary. If
       it were to be handled in any other way a single stage operation would be preferable.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> commented that the timing was connected
       with developments in Lebanon. It would be impossible for the U.K. to remain in Jordan after
       U.S. forces had left Lebanon.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that it was hard to predict how long our forces would be remaining in
       Lebanon. Some troops at least would probably leave when General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> came into office. We had taken one Marine battalion out this
        morning.<note n="6" xml:id="d267fn6">On August 11, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
         >Twining</persName> reported to the President that the Joint Chiefs were making plans for
        the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon. He thought that any withdrawal of U.S. troops should
        be done quietly and with dignity, without making a fanfare. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName> agreed, commenting that he would have to look at any specific
        proposal. (Memorandum of conference with the President; Eisenhower Library,

       another battalion afloat with the Sixth Fleet. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> said that he had been asked at the airport whether the U.K. intended to
       follow the U.S. example and remove some of its forces from Jordan. He had replied that the
       U.K. would not have as many troops in Jordan as the U.S. in Lebanon. The Secretary said that
       we had about 15, 000 troops in Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
       said there were about 3, 000 British troops in Jordan. Their situation would be extremely
       tenuous if matters got bad there. There might have to be a forceful evacuation involving the
       use of British airpower stationed on Cyprus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> pointed out the possible consequences should there be British flights
       over Israel, at the same time Israel was attacking Jordan.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> returned to the question of tactics. The
       British had planned along the lines of first the Secretary speaking, then <persName
        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, and then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName>, perhaps on Thursday.<note n="7" xml:id="d267fn7">August 14.</note> Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> felt that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> could still plan to speak on Thursday if he wished to make the necessary
       arrangements with Sir Leslie Monroe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
       inquired as to whether the Lebanese and Jordanian delegations had arrived. Sir
        <persName>William Hayter</persName> said that he was seeing Abdul Mun’im Rifa’i at <pb
        n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0492"/>5:00 p.m. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> reported that according to our latest information the Government of
       Lebanon still had not worked out the composition of its delegation. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> inquired as to when the Secretary planned to speak. The
       Secretary replied he would be speaking at some stage in the proceedings, perhaps toward the
       end.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> commented that the Russian objective was
       to turn the whole Assembly into an operation to get us out of Lebanon and Jordan. We should
       get the Assembly to take some action with respect to indirect aggression and hostile
       propaganda. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> asked how sinister would the
       Indians be. Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Pierson Dixon</persName> stated they would be a
       nuisance. He reported that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had that day had
       lunch with the Indians and the new Iraqis. He felt the Indian behavior was sympathetic of the
       behavior we would observe from a number of nations. This pointed up the need for our taking a
       positive line quickly.</p>
      <p>There followed a brief discussion as to when we should introduce resolutions. The Secretary
       commented that if we sought to have the Japanese reintroduce their resolution we would have
       to wait until the arrival of Foreign Minister Fujiyama on Thursday. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> felt that we should not sponsor any resolutions. He
       believed the President’s speech would be the first step in the proper direction, then we
       would arrange for others to introduce resolutions.</p>
      <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DSP2">Pierson Dixon</persName> thought that our resolutions might
       be introduced Thursday or Friday. There was a need to consult further with the Secretary
       General, who was thinking along the lines of perhaps four resolutions. The first would be a
       general statement of principles, a resolution on Jordan, a separate resolution on Lebanon,
       and finally a resolution on the withdrawal of U.S. and U.K. forces. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said he did not like the idea of a separate resolution
       on withdrawal.</p>
      <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> read the text of a
       resolution which the Soviet Union had just submitted.<note n="8" xml:id="d267fn8">U.N. doc.
        A/3870, August 12; printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
         1958</hi>, p. 1031.</note> It recommended that the U.S. and U.K. withdraw their forces
       without delay. It authorized the Secretary General to expand the activities of the observers
       in Lebanon as recommended in the second <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>
        report.<note n="9" xml:id="d267fn9">U.N. doc. S/4069, July 30; printed in part <hi
         rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> pp. 1006–1009.</note> It proposed that the Secretary General
       despatch observers to Jordan to observe the withdrawal of British forces after which they
       should observe the situation along the frontiers of both countries. The Secretary commented
       that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> resolution was an extremely able piece of
       drafting.</p>
      <p>The discussion returned to the problem of whether there should be separate resolutions on
       Jordan and Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that he would like
       to see a combined resolution including language covering non-interference and economic
       development. We would then seek <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0493"/>middle-of-the-road
       sponsorship for such a resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
       suggested that a working party be formed to draw up such a resolution. There was further
       discussion as to whether economic development should be included in such a resolution. No
       decision was reached on this point. The Secretary felt it would be useful to set up a couple
       of people to draw up one resolution covering Lebanon and Jordan and the problem of indirect
       aggression and a separate one on economic development. On the question of a radio monitoring
       unit a separate resolution would probably be required. The Secretary said that while we would
       like to see such a resolution get through the Assembly, he had grave doubts as to its
       prospect of passage.</p>
      <p>The final portion of the meeting was taken up with the discussion of our possible reaction
       to the Soviet solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> pressed hard for
       the joint introduction as quickly as possible of a resolution which would clearly set forth
       the positions we had taken on Jordan and Lebanon. He felt this would put us in the best
       tactical position before the Assembly and allow for a compromise between our and the Soviet
       Union’s resolutions more nearly to our liking. The Secretary outlined briefly the points that
       such a resolution might contain. It was agreed that a draft of such a resolution would be
       prepared for further consideration.</p>

      <p>The Secretary said he had wanted to talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
        >Gromyko</persName> in an effort to do something constructive about the situation of the
       Middle East. Things could happen there which could have serious consequences. The Secretary
       was particularly concerned about what would happen if Jordan collapsed—from the standpoint of
       the Arab-Israeli dispute. There was a lot of recrimination over the Arab-Israeli question and
       differences were serious. He had no real answer to the question. Jordan was not a viable
       country. The only reason for assuring its existence was that if it disappeared suddenly,
       there might be serious effects that could have other consequences. He hoped that it would be
       possible to find some solution to that situation.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that the Secretary had mentioned
       Jordan. He asked, what about Lebanon?</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that it was his belief that it might be given a neutral status somewhat
       along the Austrian pattern. It was a state that, because its population was half Christian
       and half Moslem, had always existed with a precarious balance between the two groups. They
       got along all right as long as they were not involved in troubles with the other Arab states.
       It has not historically been a part of Arabia. The Secretary said he thought a solution to
       the Lebanese problem could be found. It has a possibility of independent existence. It has
       been getting along well economically. Its currency is sound. It exists on trade and tourist
       business. He could see a stable situation in Lebanon. Jordan was more difficult and more
       dangerous. Its significance lay in its relation to the problem of Israel. He did not see
       clearly how to keep Jordan going or how to face the consequences of its collapse. Jordan was
       originally created by the British as a base as an alternative to the one they had at Suez. It
       was subsidized by them. After they left, it was subsidized by three Arab states. Now the
       United States is supporting it. It has no resources. No solution has been found for the
       problem of Arab refugees. It is nothing but a headache. The Secretary said that he had been
       unable to think of any program that would not reopen the Israeli war.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that it was one thing to touch upon the
       problem of the existence of Jordan and Lebanon. It was another question to achieve stability
       in the area where there was danger of serious conflict. There was the question of withdrawal
       of United States troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan. How could one deal with
       the question of Lebanon and Jordan without dealing with the question of the troops. He
       pointed out that the Soviet position remained unchanged. They believed the United States
       should withdraw its troops from Lebanon and Great Britain from Jordan. When the withdrawal
       took place, in spite of the difficulties and complexities of the situation, it would be
       possible to insure the independence and integrity of both states. It could not be impossible,
       between the United States and the <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0495"/>U.S.S.R., to
       insure the existence of these countries as independent states. The basic question was how to
       solve the problem. In the opinion of the Soviet Union, the solution would be the withdrawal
       of United States and British troops. This would in no way affect the prestige of the United
       States or even less its security. The action would serve as a good example and would get good
       words, not only from the Arab states, but others as well. With regard to the internal
       questions of Lebanon and Jordan, which worry the United States and Britain, Britain seems
       more worried about the situation in Jordan. Let the Jordanese themselves solve their own
       problems. This goes for Lebanon as well.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that there was no problem in United States troops coming out of
       Lebanon—assuming a situation in which the continued independence of Lebanon was provided. He
       did not believe that the United States felt its prestige was enhanced by the presence of its
       troops in Lebanon. It has had its troops all over the world. It had withdrawn them and not
       sent them back anywhere unless they were invited. We are proud of this record. The first
       thing the United States wants to do is to get out of Lebanon. With regard to the latter’s
       independence, it has just chosen a new government. Thus, the allegation that we moved in to
       perpetuate <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> proved unfounded as had the
       allegation that we intended to attack Iraq. We had only one purpose—to stay in Lebanon only
       so long as our troops were needed and wanted by the Government of Lebanon to protect it
       against the danger of indirect aggression. As soon as the danger was removed, the troops
       would move right out. We did not feel that our prestige was engaged. The Secretary said he
       agreed that Jordan was a more difficult matter.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked that if the United States did not
       desire to keep its troops in Lebanon, what hindered their withdrawal right now, today.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that there was no adequate insurance that efforts from the outside would
       not be resumed if we withdrew. Not only have we not been asked to withdraw from Lebanon, but
       we have been requested to stay there.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked whether the question was one of
       penetration through its borders by arms and personnel. Although there was a different
       attitude toward the United Nations Observer Group in different quarters, the Group’s
        report<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">An apparent reference to the second report of the <gloss
         target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Observation Group in Lebanon; see <ref target="#d267fn9"
         >footnote 9, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>. The third <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1"
         >UNOGIL</gloss> report, covering the period July 15–August 11, was submitted to the
        Security Council through the Secretary-General on August 14. (U.N. doc. S/4085; printed in
        part in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958</hi>, pp.
        1039–1041)</note> seemed adequate. Why was it not so for the United States? What other
       danger was there?</p>
      <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0496"/>
      <p>The Secretary said that there had been some strengthening of the Observer Group and in view
       of the improved situation, we had announced today that one battalion was being withdrawn.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, regarding this argument, there
       can be a difference in opinion as to whether or not the situation has improved or worsened.
       However, if it is considered improved then the situation is more propitious than ever for the
       withdrawal of American troops. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the
       withdrawal of one battalion lacks the force of conviction on our part. First, troops were put
       in and then one battalion withdrawn. This cannot make an impression on serious-minded people,
       not only those in the Soviet Union. The United States’ withdrawal would not only not
       aggravate the situation, but would pave the way for the settlement of various problems as he
       suggested a year ago should be done. If the United States is interested in moving in this
       direction, it cannot but take such a step. The Soviet attitude is well-known—it supports the
       withdrawal of American troops. It seems to the Soviets that the United States will have to
       face the question as to whether it should withdraw now and demonstrate good will rather than
       wait for the pressure of the Arabs, and not only the Arabs, which will bring this about. The
       presence of American troops there is contrary to the interests of the Arabs and contrary to
       the peace of the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that there was a difference of opinion about this. We considered that
       the presence of our troops there was, and still is, an important contribution to peace. There
       is nothing wrong with having troops in another country at the request of the government of
       that country.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would like to put a question to
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. He said the United States apparently
       claims that its action does not violate the United Nations Charter. He asked what provision
       of the Charter allows such action. The Soviet Union knew the Charter very well having taken
       part in drawing it up. There was no provision for sending troops to a country as a means of
       interfering in its internal affairs, even if this is done by the most legitimate request.
       This was not envisaged in the Charter, never was, nor never could be—leaving aside the
       question as to whether or not the request were legitimate.</p>
      <p>The Secretary remarked that he had asked whether it was an international crime to have
       troops in other countries.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said yes.</p>
      <p>The Secretary asked whether or not the Soviet Union had troops in other countries.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said when this is done in accordance with
       negotiated treaty obligations, this is a different matter. The United States also has troops
       in Europe. But you say the presence of your troops in Lebanon <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465"
        facs="0497"/>does not contradict the Charter. When troops are sent for the purpose of
       interfering, this is not in accordance with the Charter. It is a crime even when it is done
       at the request of the country concerned.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said, yes, it is a crime to interfere in internal affairs. We did not go to
       Lebanon for that purpose. We have been accused of going there to keep <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in office. This has been proved false.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked whether or not it was interference in
       internal affairs to bring about the election of this or that person inside another
       country.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said, certainly it was—but we did not interfere in the election in Lebanon.
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was not our candidate.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked why the United States had landed
       there?</p>
      <p>At this point, the Secretary strongly remarked that there was no use getting into a debate
       on pre-determined positions. He had come to talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
        >Gromyko</persName> hoping to achieve something constructive. There was no use in arguing
       and going over standard views. This could be done in the Assembly; we know the public
       position of the Soviet Union very well. He had hoped for something constructive.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the Secretary had referred to
       our reasons for introducing troops into Lebanon and that he had been answering the remarks
       made by the Secretary. As to finding a constructive basis, there was no lack of desire on the
       part of the Soviet Union. He asked what the Secretary had in mind. The Secretary said that we
       hoped to create the basic conditions for stabilizing the situation in Lebanon and making
       possible our withdrawal.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked what these conditions were. If it were
       a question of prevention penetration from the outside, then the Observer Group existed for
       this purpose. If there was dissatisfaction with the Group, it would be logical to reinforce
       it. There had been no proposal made by the Secretary and he had merely come to a logical
       conclusion.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that he was thinking along the lines that there should be some change in
       the character of the Observer Group. This was more important than any increase in numbers.
       Also, the neighboring states should make it clear that they intend to let Lebanon alone.
       Under these conditions, the Secretary thought that it would be possible for the United States
       to withdraw. It was not practical to have a large and continuously functioning Observer Group
       in order to patrol Lebanon’s borders and protect Lebanon by it alone. If there were some
       reliable indication that its neighbors really would let it alone, the numbers of the Group
       could be reduced. It would, however, be important for United Nations presence to remain there
       for some time. This would not require a large patrol if the neighboring states lent some
       cooperation. The newly-elected Government would be more acceptable perhaps than the previous
       one. The latter had been pro-Western and while we cannot criticize it on that score, the new
       one coming in <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0498"/>in September would be less vulnerable
       to outside attack. If there were assurances from Lebanon’s neighbors and the character of the
       Observer Group strengthened, the resulting situation would permit our withdrawal.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if it is assumed that the states
       the Secretary had in mind made statements indicating that any doubts about their furnishing
       aid to parties in Lebanon lack foundation—specifically, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>, which has made such statements—would these statements be enough to arouse the
       necessary confidence from the viewpoint of the United States Government? A second question:
       What did the Secretary have in mind when he said that the nature of the Observer Group might
       be changed? Perhaps that was something that could be discussed.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that, with respect to the first question, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> had been deeply involved in the Lebanon affair. Its efforts were largely
       suspended when Hammarskjold went to Cairo. The situation was better in that regard. If there
       were clear pledges in that respect and if there were enough of a United Nations presence to
       show its interest and create a good chance the violations might be exposed, he thought this
       would create the situation he had mentioned. In this view, United Nations interest and
       presence were enough. The frontiers could not be protected by surrounding the country. If the
       people outside wanted to penetrate the frontiers they would find some way of doing so. He
       attached more importance to whether or not there was a sincere willingness on the part of
       Lebanon’s neighbors to let Lebanon alone and to the United Nations showing continued interest
       even if on a lesser scale. If the Government of Lebanon considered this enough, we would
       withdraw quickly. The present Government might not ask us to do so, but he thought the
       incoming one would.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked whether this would mean postponing
       measures to withdraw our troops.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that it would, although we are already beginning to cut down.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said supposing the two conditions the
       Secretary mentioned were met—that referring to the attitude of the neighboring states and
       that referring to the interest of the United Nations—would our withdrawal still be
       postponed.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that, if we were assured of these two conditions, we could move rather
       rapidly.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked, what about the British?</p>
      <p>The Secretary said this would be more difficult.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that the British seemed to want to
       continue sitting on a war horse, but all that they had was a dead horse.</p>
      <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0499"/>
      <p>The Secretary observed he was not sure that the horse would stay dead. It might revive and
       even involve the Russians. The Jordanian problem was interlocked with Israel. Neither of us
       should want the British to withdraw until we see that the result will not be the reopening of
       the Arab-Israeli armistice. The Secretary said he did not see how this could be done. He then
       said that he was due to see Hammarskjold at 7:30 p.m., and would have to leave. He observed
       that he thought the talk was beginning to be more constructive.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, if it were assumed that the
       United States and the U.S.S.R. would exert joint efforts, make some joint statement perhaps
       about the borders of Jordan being menaced, take some decision, perform some form of joint
       act—would that not remove doubts about the international affairs of Jordan? Then the
       Jordanese could be allowed to settle their own domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that there was a fiscal problem involved. We were putting up $50 million
       a year to maintain Jordan and did not want to do this forever.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, if it were possible to reach
       agreement on the basic questions, it would be easy to settle the economic problem. This would
       not be serious if the others were settled.</p>
      <p>The Secretary observed that there was a time when three Arab states—Iraq, Saudi Arabia and
       Egypt—subsidized Jordan to the extent of $10 million each per year. Perhaps the financial
       problem could be solved. There was an even chance, however, that Israel would move in to take
       over the right bank and war between her and the Arabs would follow. The Arabs would appeal to
       the Russians for help and Israel to the French and ourselves. (At this point, the Secretary
       arose to depart.)</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he believed the conversation had
       been useful.</p>

      <p>On August 13, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> addressed the
       Special Emergency Session of the General Assembly called to consider the crisis in the Middle
       East. The session had opened on August 8 with statements by Soviet Representative
        <persName>Sobolev</persName> and U.S. Representative <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
        >Lodge</persName> reiterating positions taken in the foregoing Security Council debate.
       (U.N. doc. A/PV 732) <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> addressed the
       organization for the first time in 5 years and did so as a head of state rather than as a
       member of the U.S. delegation.</p>
      <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0500"/>
      <p>His speech touched on the specific issues involved in the debate initiated on August 8
       largely as a point of departure for an overview of regional problems. He pointed out that
       U.S. and British forces were in Lebanon and Jordan at the invitation of the local
       governments, and he pledged that U.S. forces would be withdrawn whenever requested by the
       Lebanese Government or as soon as the independence and integrity of Lebanon was assured. He
       added that the crisis occasioned by indirect aggression in Jordan continued and urged prompt
       action by the General Assembly to prevent an expanding conflict of a “far-reaching nature.”
       To guard against this kind of indirect aggression, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> proposed the creation of a standby <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> Peace Force to react to threats when they occurred.</p>
      <p>Considering the region as a whole, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> also
       suggested that, to alleviate tensions between Israel and the Arab States, the nations
       involved in the 1948 hostilities should call for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> study
       of the flow of heavy armaments into the area to determine whether arms control arrangements
       could be instituted. The centerpiece of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s
       address was a proposal to establish a regional economic development plan and corresponding
       Arab development organization to accelerate inprovement in living standards in the Arab
       States. He suggested consultations between the Secretary-General and the Arab States to
       ascertain whether a consensus existed in favor of establishing an Arab development
       institution. If such an organization was established and governed by the Arab States, and if
       it was supported with Arab resources, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
       indicated that the United States would also be prepared to support it. (U.N. doc. A/PV.733,
       printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName
         corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1958</hi>, pages 606–616)</p>
      <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s speech was drafted by
        <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">C. D. Jackson</persName>, a long-time presidential adviser and
       speech writer, who was recruited from <hi rend="italic">Time-Life</hi> in New York as a
       consultant to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to help prepare the
       speech. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had told <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on August 7 that he did not want to engage in
       controversial debate or head the U.S. Delegation to the emergency meeting of the General
       Assembly, but was willing to make a lead-off address couched in lofty terms that would rise
       above the immediate controversy. (Memorandum of conversation with the President, August 7;
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Meetings with the President)
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> discussed the speech with <persName
        corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> on the same day and told him that he wanted no more
       than a paragraph on the immediate crisis in the Middle East. He wanted the rest of the speech
       to deal with constructive and useful proposals, and demonstrate that the United States was
       practical as well as idealistic. (Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation, August 7; <hi
        rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> Whitman File, Eisenhower Diaries)</p>
      <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0501"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> submitted a 7-page memorandum to <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on August 7, outlining the nature of the speech he felt
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> should deliver. <persName
        corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> saw the speech as an opportunity for the United States
       to demonstrate a positive attitude toward the “constructive” aspects of the nationalist
       movements emerging in the Middle East and around the world. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> should, he felt, reaffirm U.S. determination to oppose Communist
       disruption and expansion, but offer a program of economic encouragement to constructive
       nationalist movements. He did not feel that the speech should be framed in a negative vein as
       a condemnation of indirect aggression. (Department of State, Central Files, 320/8–758) There
       is a full account of the background and drafting of the speech in the log maintained by
        <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> from July 24, when <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> called to ask him to come to Washington, through the
       delivery of the speech on August 13. (Eisenhower Library, Jackson Papers, Log—1958) All these

      <p>Dr. <persName>Fawzi</persName> referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
        >Murphy</persName>’s recent talk with President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">See <ref target="#d260">Document
        260</ref>.</note> and said that after an initial period of groping, the conversation had
       “sailed”. He hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> had brought back
       the impression of the complete frankness of that discussion. The Secretary felt that it had
       been a useful conversation. He said that there had also come the impression that President
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> believed that the Secretary had a personal
       unfriendliness toward him. The Secretary wished to dissipate such an impression. First of
       all, it was not true. Furthermore, <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0502"/>it would be
       criminal to operate governments on the basis of personal likes and dislikes. Were this the
       case, the U.S. would not have taken actions favorable to Egypt and the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> which were unfavorable to countries with which we had long and
       friendly relations. It was the Secretary’s ambition to leave the world more devoted to
       principle in the conduct of international affairs. The Secretary felt this was a critical
       moment because we could not countenance methods which, if generally prevalent, would bring
       the world to chaos and perhaps even war. This was perhaps the basic difference between us.
       The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> felt it was legitimate to use methods which we felt
       were dangerous. This was, however, a difference of principle and not a personal one. The
       Secretary had the highest regard and respect for President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> who was an extremely able man. He was not surprised that the Arabs looked
       up to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Secretary wished to get on
       to a basis of good relations. As President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
       had said yesterday, unification, if it took place as a result of the will of the people
       concerned, could and should be accomplished through peaceful processes.<note n="3"
        xml:id="d270fn3">See <ref target="#d269"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note></p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said he could not take exception to the
       Secretary’s remarks. The impression that President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> felt that the Secretary disliked him personally was not accurate.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said he wished to mention the importance of
       the fact that we were facing a debate which could run away. He trusted that efforts would be
       made to keep it in hand. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> might in
       his speech today say things which would make the task of restoring normalcy more difficult.
       The Secretary said he had no idea what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>
       would say. He commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s speech<note
        n="4" xml:id="d270fn4"><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> followed <persName
         corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in addressing the General Assembly on August 13. He
        charged that the special session was necessitated by “armed intervention by the United
        States in Lebanon and by the United Kingdom in Jordan.” He characterized the western
        intervention in Lebanon and Jordan as a “violation of peace” in which the fundamental rules
        of international law and the principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Charter
        were “flouted.” He called on the General Assembly to take the steps necessary to secure the
        withdrawal of U.S. and British forces from the area. (U.N. doc. A/PV.733)</note> had not
       been helpful. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that such a speech coming
       from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not surprising. In fact, some
       delegates had even felt that it had been relatively moderate.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> continued that it was evident that the
       Jordanian delegate had instructions to make an onslaught against the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. This could open wide the controversy. The concensus among delegations was to
       try to patch things up.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said he hoped that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> felt that
       the President’s speech had been moderate. While it had contained anti-Soviet remarks, there
       had been no attack on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> said that the President had confined himself to general principles. If
       anyone said <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0503"/>that there should be no interference in
       the affairs of other states, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would agree. It would
       also agree to sensible measures to make others concerned feel more comfortable. The U.S.
       might agree that it was not a good thing to try to pin blame. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> could not object to any measure to bolster arrangements to safeguard any
       country’s independence.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that he was uninformed as to the nature of the Jordanian delegate’s
       speech. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that he thought that the
       Jordanian was going to make his attack yesterday. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> had prepared a reply. Since he had been quiet, Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> had been quiet. It was clear, however, that the Jordanian
       delegate had instructions to make a strong speech. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> said that we were all here to be useful.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that he was worried about Jordan. It was an artificial state which had
       been created by the U.K. as an alternate base, perhaps, in the Middle East. It had been
       subsidized first by the British, briefly by the three Arab states, and now by the U.S. It
       took a lot of money to keep it going. The reason for its existence was that its disappearance
       might reopen the Arab-Israeli war. We were paying tribute to hold Jordan so that war would
       not break out. Jordan had nothing of interest to us. It was of interest to all, however, that
       there be no chaos in the area. We did not know Israel’s purposes, but there was a 50–50
       chance that if Jordan collapsed, the Israelis would occupy the West Bank. This could start a
       lot of other things. There was a common interest to try to preserve peace so that Jordan’s
       future could evolve peacefully. The Secretary admitted, however, that he was at a loss to
       know how such a peaceful evolution might take place.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thought that we could put things together
       and find a way. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> thought, of course, that we should
       not allow the situation in Jordan to start a chain reaction and was interested in not having
       this happen. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> felt that if sufficient assurances were
       given that neither an Israeli nor Arab attack would be tolerated, particularly by the two big
       powers, this would be a solid part of the structure of peace. As long as the U.K. military
       presence continued in Jordan, the horizon was blocked on the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> side and there could be only unhelpful groping.</p>
      <p>What would happen if the U.K. withdrew? The likelihood was that King Hussein could not
       remain. It was for the people of Jordan to decide who was to rule them. None of us should
       interfere. The U.K. said that it wished to be loyal to its friends. This might be a virtue
       but it should not be at the expense of creating an impossible situation in the area by
       imposing King Hussein and his government by force. If the Jordanian people wished to keep
       King Hussein, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not object. If they wished to
       remain a separate state, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not oppose. If they
       wished to join Iraq or Saudi Arabia, this was not the <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0504"
        /><gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s business. The one thing that Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> could not promise was that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> would accept Jordan. He was not sure that this would be a good thing.</p>
      <p>The Secretary pointed out that Jordan would be a liability to whomever took it over. Dr.
        <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that he declined the honor. It was more
       natural that oil-rich Iraq do so. The Secretary felt that this could be a logical step and
       could broaden the opportunities for refugees. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>
       did not disagree but felt that this question should not be opened publicly. The Secretary
       replied that he would not say this out loud.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that he had crossed his fingers
       yesterday in the hope that the President would not link economic development to the refugee
       problem. It was pleasing that the President had not done so.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> then turned to the economic proposal which
       the President had outlined yesterday. This would take the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
       awhile to study. However, it was obvious to all that every living thing needed a proper
       atmosphere. It seemed to him that the indispensable thing before we went deeper was a rapid
       withdrawal of the troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Then the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> and U.S. could consult if it were desired. A first point might be the exchange
       of assurances between Jordan and Israel that neither would attack the other. The <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would approve such an exchange and would subscribe to it
       privately and publicly. These should not, of course, go so far as to represent a form of
       peace with Israel. This was too soon. The Secretary commented that the President had not
       mentioned the Arab-Israel problem.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that timing was all important to avoid
       missing a good train. Already there were people nibbling at the economic proposals with the
       intention of doing harm. The U.S. doubtless knew who were these natural saboteurs who came
       from both within and outside the area. While the U.S. should not be over-alarmed by
       expressions of hasty disapproval, we should not let such a feeling grow too much, too soon.
       The U.S. should not let happen what happened to the Eisenhower Doctrine. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> stated that Egypt had remained silent two months about the
       Doctrine and then had taken a position against it. It would be a pity if this happened
       again.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> referred briefly to the Pella
        proposals<note n="5" xml:id="d270fn5">Apparent reference to proposals advanced by Italian
        Foreign Minister Giuseppe Pella, and subsequently outlined by the Italian Representative
        Attilio Piccioni in the General Assembly on August 18. (U.N. doc. A/PV.739)</note> which he
       felt had been badly timed and which gave the impression that their implementation would
       involve the expression of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interest in the area. The
       President had made clear that the U.S. would not insist upon a preponderant role in the
       institution. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> felt that it should not have too
       big a U.S. flag on it. It should be allowed to grow and the <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
        facs="0505"/>U.S. should encourage its friends in the area to contribute. Iraq was a natural
       contributor; Saudi Arabia could become one, although they had little money at present; Kuwait
       could be one. The thing did not have to grow too quickly but it could soon become a nucleus
       of economic sanity. The area was potentially rich. It wished to become dynamically rich.
       There would be a need for liquid capital. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>
       preferred loans on easy terms, not called “foreign investment” which had unpleasant
       overtones. He did not exclude direct loans of this nature. Technical assistance would be paid
       for by the receiving state. Within a few years a viable Middle East, more robust and less
       subject to outside infiltration and subversion, could emerge. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> government, including President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
       was at the disposal of the U.S. to consult as to how not to allow a well-conceived economic
       program to disintegrate.</p>
      <p>After the voting had taken place, high level consultations could be entered into between
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and U.S. We would have to face the matter of taking
       precautions against sabotage and misunderstanding coming from Moscow and perhaps Paris.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> felt perhaps that the time was too short.
       He had spoken to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> whose response had not
       been positive. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wished to extend a helpful hand,
       that would be all right. If they did not, it would not be wise for them to sabotage the
       project but they might have their own reasons. How could we deal with this? It was not Dr.
        <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>’s business to advise the U.S. how to talk to the
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. There was, however, no point in setting up something
       which could not live.</p>
      <p>The Secretary wondered if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> felt that there
       could be further useful talks between himself and the Secretary. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said he was at the Secretary’s disposal. The time had come
       when we should refresh our knowledge of each other’s thought and position. It may be that
       what we thought were serious differences would turn out to be less serious upon
       examination.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said he would try to arrange for another talk perhaps on August 15.</p>

        which would cover the points made by the President on August 13 in his speech to the General
        Assembly. He told Engen that he had only discussed the resolution with the British
        Delegation before raising the matter with him. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
        and Engen discussed the problem posed by Jordan at some length, and Engen agreed to consider
        acting as a sponsor of the resolution which was ultimately advanced on August 18 by Norway,
        Denmark, Canada, Colombia, Liberia, Panama, and Paraguay. (U.N. doc. A/3878, printed in <hi

        was initially cautious, however, and discussed the draft resolution with the
        Secretary-General before agreeing to sound other delegations concerning cosponsorship.

      <p>1130. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and I had a lengthy review
       of situation this morning with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.
       Following points emerged: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>Effect of US withdrawal: General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he
         was pleased with results of retraction second Marine Battalion. It had had effect he had
         predicted on opposition. Already he had noted a lessened stridency in their propaganda
         output; and he was certain from internal <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0509"
         />information that more moderate leaders had been enabled to get a firmer grip on rank and
         file than before. So far as Loyalists–Christian element was concerned withdrawal of Marine
         Battalion had not had repercussions which certain elements had feared. For example
          <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> and his phalangists had taken matter calmly
         and more reflective Christian elements such as the intellectuals had been forced to begin
         thinking on ways and means to find compromise solutions which would end Lebanese internal
         crisis.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>He thought in a guarded way it would be possible to contemplate withdrawal of an
         additional battalion before his inauguration September 24. It was agreed however there
         would be no recommendation prior consultation keeping in mind political effect of such a
         movement. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought however it would have a
         beneficial result coming before he takes office.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>General said several times during conversation that presence of US forces in Lebanon
         had been of decisive beneficial effect. He said that had we not arrived with strength we
         deployed in Lebanon, it would have been difficult to see how country could have been saved
         from complete anarchy.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item><p>Continuing on this theme the General said he had yesterday been approached by
           <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss> to ascertain his thinking on possibility of
          establishing a small <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> armed police force in Lebanon.
           <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had told <gloss target="#t_UN1"
           >UN</gloss> observers he was firmly opposed to any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
          police force which might have internal responsibilities in this country although he was
          willing to study possibilities of establishing a small <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
          force which might do guard duty on the frontiers. In general however he felt <gloss
           target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss> should not expand its numbers and he is personally
          opposed to having its members armed. He plans to discuss this with <persName
           corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> tomorrow.</p>
         <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said “The President and I look upon this
          matter in an inverse light; I regard it with a view to the future and he looks on it with
          a view to the past. So far as <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and company
          are concerned, they would be willing to have any number of foreign troops in Lebanon.
          However, I must look to a solution reached by the Lebanese people themselves and I do not
          think it can be accomplished by the perpetual stationing of foreign forces in Lebanon
          whether American or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.”</p>
         <p>General said as he sees matters now <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could play useful
          psychological role in maintaining its small observer corps here for a short interval after
          final withdrawal of US forces. However, throughout our interview he made it very clear he
          does not desire nor would he request withdrawal of US troops until security situation has
          been restored; he also made it clear he did not himself favor replacement of US forces by
          any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> armed forces.</p></item>
        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0510"/>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>General confirmed information I had already received that Deputy Ali Bazzi had been
         sent by him to Damascus to discuss Syrian-Egyptian intentions regarding Lebanon in future.
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he was extremely pleased that in
         addition to lip service assurance Ali Bazzi received from <persName>Serraj</persName>, his
         emissary had more explicit and affirmative assurances from Hakim Amer himself. In fact the
         Field Marshal gave instructions to <persName>Serraj</persName> in Bazzi’s presence for
         withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> “commandos" from the Basta. <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said first detachment of these commandos left Beirut
         yesterday; he hoped their entire member would be withdrawn into Syria in immediate future.
         With departure of these foreign hardcore agitators he hoped opposition in Basta would
         commence go although he did not think fact there would be cases of violence, of kidnapping,
         and extortion for some time to come.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>As to security in Lebanon generally <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was
         guardedly optimistic. He said that despite constant individual reports of free-looting and
         banditry (some of which were highly colored) he had from his own intelligence sources as
         well as from tribal and religious leaders clear evidence that the security position was
         steadily improving. He was particularly heartened by offer of rebel leaders north of
         Tripoli to permit Maronite patriarch to send a mission to the Akkar area to see for
         themselves that security was being restored by opposition leaders in that area. The General
         likewise predicted security in South Lebanon would soon be back almost to normal; and added
         that he was receiving good cooperation from Jumblatt in restraining acts of vengeance and
         vandalism in the Chouf.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item>I observed to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> that in order to expedite
         restoration of security situation it seemed to me that in addition to police-type action by
         armed forces and gendarmes, it was likewise important to reestablish economic life of
         country. As root cause of much violence was fact men were becoming desperate because their
         families needed funds and food. I asked if army could not arrange for convoying truck
         caravan from Beirut to Syrian frontier. If we could open transit trade once more to Syria,
         Jordan and Iraq, Beirut would commence to regain its old position as an entrepot and thus
         by economic means we might redress security posture. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> said he would gladly guarantee security of truck convoys to Syrian
         frontier but asked what I could do with Lebanese Government. Specifically <persName>Sami
          Solh</persName> (which had by decree closed the border). I said I would very gladly
         approach Lebanese Government to get this decree rescinded. I also said I had been heartened
         by estimate of my colleague in Damascus who is currently visiting Beirut that Syrian
         authorities would probably be ready to give assurances for safe return of Lebanese trucks
         once normal commerce was restored. I plan to see Prime Minister and <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to get Lebanese Government to open frontier.</item>
        <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0511"/>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>Our general impression of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was that of a
         man with much increased confidence in his own ability to confront a thorny situation and a
         man who is determined not to yield to partisan importunity or pressure from either side,
         whether opposition or government, Christian or Moslem. Certainly insofar as his attitude
         toward our armed forces and <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1">CINCSPECOMME</gloss> is
         concerned, it could not be more cooperative and sympathetic.</item>

       <p>From numerous conversations with a variety of personalities and information from other

        12, the following thoughts emerge: <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0512"/>

         <item>A temporary if precarious balance of power has been achieved between the
          determination manifest by the United States and United Kingdom in the deployment of
          military forces on the one hand, and the popular dynamism of Arab unity as symbolized by
           <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on the other. This breathing space should
          be utilized to launch a program which will promote a constructive era and peace and

          masses, to their desire not only for better economic conditions and especially their

      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he had postponed his arrival in New
       York so as to have an opportunity for detailed discussions with Lebanese leaders,
       particularly President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and President-elect
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. They had two large questions in their minds
       of equal importance. The first was that of the presence of US forces. Both felt (<persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> even more than <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>) that too early a withdrawal of these forces could spell disaster to
       Lebanon. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was beginning to feel the
       weight of responsibility. They were concerned at press and other reports regarding the
       concerted onslaught of the Communists and their fellow travelers against the presence of US
       forces in Lebanon and apprehensive lest this affect US policy.</p>
      <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0514"/>
      <p>Their second question was what would come out of the present General Assembly with regard
       to Lebanon. If it were only words, this would be too meager an outcome for the genuine
       excitement which had gripped the world. What could the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
       do to give Lebanon peace of mind? General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had
       told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> that he hoped that nothing would be done
       which would have the effect of tying his hands before he assumed power. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> replied that he had no intention of tying General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s hands but felt that Lebanon should take
       advantage of the present situation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> had
       undertaken to keep in close touch with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
       >Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>The Secretary stated that we had been working intensively, particularly over the last
       twenty-four hours, on a possible <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> resolution which
       touched upon both matters. There was a desire to get some assurances from countries such as
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Iraq and even Israel that they would keep their
       hands off Lebanon and Jordan and to make such countries realize that if they did not, they
       would be subject to serious condemnation. It was not possible to get ironclad guarantees
       which we could be sure would work. The formula we were working on now would contain a
       reference to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> objectives including those contained in the
       “Essentials for Peace” resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">Reference is to the “Essentials
        of Peace” resolution of 1949. (<gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Resolution 290
        (IV))</note> and link them to Lebanon and Jordan. The resolution would then go on to
       authorize the Secretary General to work out further practical measures.</p>
      <p>With respect to withdrawal of US forces, we had in mind a US declaration which might
       contain the following elements: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>The reasons why our forces were in Lebanon.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>The conditions under which they would be withdrawn, including: <list>
          <label>a.</label>
          <item>a request from the duly constituted Government of Lebanon;</item>
          <label>b.</label>
          <item>a United States decision that it was satisfied that Lebanon’s independence and
           integrity had been assured; (The Secretary stated this provision was essential so that we
           could retain our freedom of action.)</item>
          <label>c.</label>
          <item>a <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> request for withdrawal on the grounds that
           the forces’ continued stay in Lebanon was no longer required for the maintenance of
           international peace and security.</item>
         </list></item>
       </list></p>
      <p>The Secretary pointed out that this last element was similar to a declaration made with
       respect to our Greek-Turkish aid program. It would require a two-thirds vote of the General
       Assembly to bring it into being, a possibility which we thought highly unlikely. We had not
       yet made this suggestion to others, but the Secretary planned to discuss it with Foreign
       Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> very shortly. This proposal might <pb
        n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0515"/>be more dangerous to the British. There seemed to be
       fairly widespread recognition in the Assembly of our reasons for sending troops to Lebanon
       and our intention to withdraw them as quickly as possible. There was, however, some suspicion
       that the British might want to remain on in Jordan. We were quite certain that this was not
       the British intention. The Secretary thought that the course of action we had in mind would
       serve to protect Lebanon. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> thought it might be
       better if we could dispense with point 2 c. The Secretary said that the British might not
       want to include such a point, in which case we probably would withdraw the suggestion.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he did not know how to disassociate
       the cases of Lebanon and Jordan, but they were very different. If Hussein went, Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> did not know what the future of Jordan would be. If
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> went, or if ten Chehabs went, there would
       still be a majority of people in Lebanon who wished to maintain the independence and
       integrity of their country. The Secretary agreed that the cases were different. He referred
       to Jordan’s unviability, need for foreign subsidy, etc., and the fact that our primary
       interest in Jordan was to prevent a reopening of the Arab-Israel war. He did not know what
       the future of Jordan was. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said that the
       Lebanese would be “insulted" to be bracketed with Jordan. Lebanon had a right to exist
       indefinitely. Perhaps some drafting device could be employed. The Secretary was not sure that
       this could be done.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Lodge felt that about the most that could be done would be to make a distinction
       between the two in speeches in the Assembly. This General Assembly had, however, been called
       on questions relating to troops in both countries. The Secretary felt that it would be
       difficult to persuade the British to accept two separate resolutions. Ambassador Lodge
       pointed out that in all frankness this was a situation where we had a stronger case than the
       British and it was a matter of the stronger trying to carry along his weaker friend.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> said he planned to speak in the Assembly on
       either Monday or Tuesday. His speech would be simple, straightforward, conciliatory and
       non-provocative. He would state how Lebanon feels about itself and how it envisages its
       future. The Secretary expressed the hope that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
       would not drop entirely the statement that the disturbance in Lebanon had been fomented from
       without. This could cut the legal ground from under us. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9"
        >Malik</persName> assured the Secretary that he would make this point clear but in a way
       calculated to avoid controversy.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> asked how long the Assembly would last. The
       Secretary said he did not expect to be in New York beyond Monday. If a resolution were tabled
       this weekend the Assembly might terminate by Wednesday. The Secretary hoped this would be the
       case.</p>
      <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0516"/>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> asked whether the Secretary thought that
       the US views as outlined above were the maximum obtainable from this Assembly. The Secretary
       felt that they were. There could emerge from these proceedings a recognition by <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> that he should keep his hands off Lebanon and Jordan for
       two different reasons; in Lebanon, its traditions and special situation; in Jordan, the
       possibility of reopening the Arab-Israel war. Even <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
        >Gromyko</persName> accepted this latter view. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName>
       professed to, but one could never be certain of exactly what <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> said. The Secretary did believe that this consideration had caught them
       short.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> wondered if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> had really been caught short. He said that infiltration and inflammatory
       broadcasts were still going on. The Secretary referred to the President’s idea of a <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> monitoring system. We probably could not get action on it during
       this special Assembly but intended to put it on the agenda of the next regular Assembly. The
       Secretary discussed briefly the problem of getting firm evidence of such activities. Often a
       broadcast which the press described as inflammatory turned out, upon examination of a tape
       recording, not to be that bad.</p>
      <p>At this point the Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
       left to attend a meeting with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
       >Lloyd</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> continued the
       discussion.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> had the general impression that the
       atmosphere in the Assembly was about as good as could be expected. The reaction to the
       President’s speech had been very good. While nothing dramatic in the way of concrete
       assurances could probably be obtained, there was a good prospect of getting a resolution
       which could establish a proper atmosphere in the area. The theme which the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had been pressing
       was the need to get the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces out and only then
       discuss constructive measures. Against this background the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">Reference is to the resolution
        introduced by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on August 12 calling for the
        strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Observer Group in Lebanon and the
        establishment of a similar group in Jordan to supervise the immediate withdrawal of U.S. and
        British forces from the area. (U.N. doc. A/3870, printed in <hi rend="italic">American
         Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958</hi>, p.1031)</note> had been judged by some
       delegations as moderate, even, in some quarters, constructive. Our effort, in which we had
       had some success, was to make it clear that the object of this special session was not to
       bring about the withdrawal of the troops but to create a situation in which the troops could
       be withdrawn. It was unfortunate, in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>’s
       view, that we had been delayed in getting a resolution tabled which would focus things in
       their proper order. He hoped we could table a resolution with the least possible delay,
       perhaps during the weekend. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> envisaged
       multiple sponsorship of such a resolution. In order to achieve wide support such a resolution
       could <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0517"/>not represent the best of all possible worlds.
       It could, however, be very constructive. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
       hoped he could see the resolution as soon as possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> agreed and said that we wished him to see the resolution as soon as we
       were in a position to show it to him; hopefully this might be this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> inquired as to how much the US Government
       really felt that there would be stability in Lebanon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> replied that, while our evaluation was not, of course, as valid as that
       of the Lebanese themselves, we hoped that outside interference would, as a result of action
       being taken here, greatly diminish. On the internal side, we believed that the election of a
       new President would have a useful effect. Our evaluation was that in the absence of
       unforeseen developments, the chances of stability in Lebanon were good. We assumed that
       President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> would serve out his term. We assumed
       that this would mean the continuation of some opposition and some disturbances in Lebanon.
       This could be justified in the light of the need to maintain constitutional procedures in
       Lebanon. After the new President assumed office, the opposition might assume a different
       attitude.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> seemed to accept the fact that from this
       session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> little more could be expected by way of
       guarantees to Lebanon. He felt, however, that there was a need for more ironclad guarantees
       with perhaps great power backing. He felt we should be working toward this end. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> discussed briefly in general terms various suggestions
       that had come to his attention with regard to attaining some sort of recognition of Lebanon’s
       status. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> indicated that he intended in his
       forthcoming speech to point out Lebanon’s historic background and the fact that it has had a
       special position in the Middle East over a number of centuries. He felt the thinking on this
       question needed more time to mature so that an international instrument affecting Lebanon
       could in due course be worked out.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> inquired as to the prospects of a great
       power meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> felt that the Soviets
       would continue to press for one and to create artificial crises which seemed to require one.
       As to a summit conference, our position remained unchanged. We would be happy to attend one
       if proper preparations were made. We would not discuss Lebanon and Jordan at such a
       conference as this was a matter for handling by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName> asked if the US and the West intended to
       continue with full vigor a campaign to expose and point out the dangers encountered in the
       processing of indirect aggression and subversion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> felt that the whole effort in which we were presently embarked
       demonstrated our intentions in this regard. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>
       inquired as to how we intended to move forward on the President’s six-point program. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said he hoped that most of the points would
       be incorporated in the resolution which would be tabled in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"

      <p>(B) King said had another subject on which he wished me report my government soonest. Asked
       if I knew of British attempt establish Nicosia/Amman airlink using planes Eagle Aviation
       Company. At this point Rifai took over conversation. Said British approached <gloss
        target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> requested views desirability finding some means partial
       replacement Cyprus/Amman military airlift. In due course advance proposal Eagle Aviation
       Company under exclusive charter British War Office should <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487"
        facs="0519"/>make bi-weekly flights transporting only military personnel/high priority
       supplies. No mention was made any stop Israel. Subsequently British without further
       consultation <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> concluded agreement <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
        >GOI</gloss> providing overflight Israel with two way landing Lydda. Radio Israel
       immediately announced inauguration new air service Nicosia/Lydda/Amman, which came as
       bombshell Jordan Government prompted several cabinet members threaten resign if deal went
       through.</p>
      <p>RIFAI summoned British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName> who said
       he not fully informed promised get all facts report Rifai. When he saw Prime Minister again
       he said <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> took position establishment airlink between
       sixteenth paratrooper brigade Amman with its rear echelon Cyprus mandatory. Johnston was
       instructed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> inform <gloss

        >HMG</gloss> would be compelled consider withdrawal British troops from Jordan. Rifai

       “ballistic blackmail” mentioned President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>

       Pasha (RIFAI largely instrumental his removal) they were mistaken. Although he unable reply
       officially without consulting King Hussein, his personal reaction if British intend use such
       high handed methods better they withdraw troops immediately. Rifai reported British ultimatum
       Hussein who ordered special meeting Council Ministers. Their reaction unanimous condemnation
       British with several Ministers threatening resign if government acceeded British demand.
       Later King Hussein called in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName>, told
       him <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> unable agree British proposal. If troops withdrawn

       stems from their desire force Jordan reach modus vivendi with Israel. There is no doubt

       <item><p>In response request for comments by Engen (Norway) who chaired meeting Secretary
         explained US position along following lines (cleared by Secretary):</p>
        <p>Secretary said joint resolution was carefully thought out and well rounded resolution
         which US would support. If anything, some people might say US had gone too far in its
         willingness to accept moderate language on withdrawal. There was danger focus of <gloss
          target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> might be shifted from complaints against interference in Jordan
         and Lebanon by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and from constructive action it might
         take to help bring stability to Middle East, into focus on Soviet demand for US and British
         withdrawal. This danger had to be carefully guarded against.</p>
        <p>Secretary said US troops had been sent to Lebanon with great reluctance. It was case
         where decision to do so was not satisfactory, but decision not to have done so would have
         been worse. US had known for six weeks that Government of Lebanon might feel it necessary
         to request assistance. We had sought to dissuade Lebanese Government from doing so. When
         revolt occurred, Lebanese Government formally requested US assistance without prior
         consultation with US. <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0521"/>In circumstances, we
         responded immediately. US troops went to assist in maintaining independence and integrity
         of Lebanon against civil strife fomented from without, and to assist in protecting American
         lives and property and for no other reasons. They would stay no longer than necessary. Two
         main concerns expressed about US action had already been dispelled. First of these was that
         US troops had been sent in to support President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> for new term as President of Lebanon; this had been dispelled by
         election of General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. Second was that US
         troops might attack Iraq. This was never any part of our intention and any suspicion that
         it may have been so was dispelled by our recognition of Iraq.</p>
        <p>Problem now facing US is whether <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can take up task and
         make it possible for US forces to withdraw. Draft res will not work, and no draft res will,
         unless it has acquiescence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. It was not vital whether
          <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> voted for res, or acquiesced by abstaining. Its real
         attitude was what was important. There could not be enough <gloss target="#t_UN1"
          >UN</gloss> soldiers in Lebanon or Jordan to protect countries against determined efforts
         by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to penetrate. Many other things—its radio broadcasts
         and supplies of money—would be difficult to prevent. Willingness of <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss> to keep its hands off was required.</p>
        <p>Lebanon and Jordan were different from other countries in Middle East and raised key
         problems of concern. Lebanon was roughly half Christian and half Moslem. Jordan occupied
         key political position in respect to general armistice agreements with Israel, raising
         serious questions with respect to general Middle Eastern stability. Neither country had any
         oil. It was apparent that neither of them had assets of such value that anyone should risk
         peace of world to get them.</p>
        <p>If <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> could obtain acquiescence of <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to keep its hands off Lebanon and set up semi-permanent
         representation of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Lebanon, it should be possible for
         US to get its forces out very quickly. US wanted to do this very much provided it did so
         under honorable conditions and with full respect to right of one nation to help another
         nation that is imperiled. It is difficult to pin down this problem much closer. Given
         acquiescence by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in program set out in res, and
         especially paragraph A,<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4"><p>Paragraph A of the draft resolution
           reads: <list>

           </list></p></note> we believe US troops can get out very soon. It is desirable they
         should stay until after change of government on September 23 or 24. General <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has already told us he is anxious that they stay until
         then. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, of course, was <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss> candidate for <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0522"/>President of Lebanon
         number of weeks ago. In fact, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had suggested US and
          <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> jointly sponsor him. We rejected this because we did
         not think it was up to either <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or US to pick pres of
         Lebanon. Now he has been chosen by Lebanese themselves. In light previous <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> position it now ought to be possible, therefore, to work out
         practical arrangements for an early withdrawal.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to pick definite calendar date. However, we would be disappointed if
         there were not acquiescence by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and action by <gloss
          target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> so that he could report by September 30 that question was
         well on way toward being resolved. In earlier conversations with FonMin Fawzi we had gotten
         impression <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be prepared to go along with program
         such as res presented. If this is still <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> attitude,
         question can be resolved quickly.</p>
        <p>Secretary also pointed out declaration US was submitting to <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss> regarding its position on withdrawal included statement we would abide by
         decision of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss><gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.<note n="5"
          xml:id="d278fn5">In an August 18 letter to the President of the General Assembly,
           <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated: “United States forces will be
          withdrawn from Lebanon whenever requested by the duly constituted Government of Lebanon,
          or whenever, as a result of the further action of the United Nations or otherwise, their
          presence is no longer required.” He added: “The United States will in any event abide by a
          determination of the United Nations General Assembly that action taken or assistance
          furnished by the United Nations makes the continued presence of United States forces in
          Lebanon unnecessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.” (U.N. doc.

          1958</hi>, p. 1042)</note> This was remarkable position beyond that ever made by any other
         government in similar circumstances. If there was anyone who still compared US position in

          target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> reluctance to go into Jordan was much same as that of US re
         Lebanon. This could be easily understood when hazardous nature of supply lines was

         for other arrangements to be made under res. It was not question of <gloss target="#t_UN1"

          >UAR</gloss> to hold off was most important. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>

         “presence”. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commissioner in Amman might be enough. Sooner

       him with <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0524"/>the Norwegian and other delegations. He did
       not think it adequately met the question of withdrawal. Until there were some more specific
       indications regarding withdrawal of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces, there
       would be serious problems for all of us. While American forces were in Lebanon, there was
       always the danger that “your boys and our boys” would become involved in difficulties which
       might spread against the wishes of both sides. From the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
       viewpoint, one half the problem involved the question of withdrawal itself and the other half
       public opinion. He wished the Secretary’s advice as to how the situation might be met.</p>
      <p>The Secretary reviewed at some length the reasons for the presence of US and <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces in Lebanon and Jordan. He said that it was difficult to
       capture in the precise words of a resolution the spirit that would be required to meet the
       situation adequately. We had, in fact, listened to the views of a number of delegations and
       had already made many concessions to those views. He thought the resolution in its present
       form provided a good basis upon which we could find a solution, provided there was the
       intention on the part of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> not to interfere in Lebanon
       and Jordan.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that in contrast to Lebanon, Jordan is an artificial state. You cannot
       do what is perhaps the natural thing, which is to have it divided up and absorbed by the
       surrounding countries. We therefore need an understanding that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> will accept the rather special position of Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
      <p>Our purpose is to get out if it is your purpose to keep your hands off, the Secretary
       declared. If this condition exists, the problem can be solved quickly. If the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has fruitful talks here with the United States and the United
       Kingdom, it should make possible a resolution which you would not oppose. A bitter fight here
       would be very bad. In drafting a resolution like this it is difficult to find the right
       words. But if the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> keeps its hands off we can get out.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> then alluded to what he described as “one
       minor point” in the resolution: the paragraph referring to the United States and British
       troops and their withdrawal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thought the
       paragraph makes it appear that the General Assembly would approve of their presence
       there.</p>
      <p>The Secretary commented that this paragraph is only a historical reference and does not
       imply approval. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> recalled that the word
       “presence” was in and we dropped it in the belief, which we got from Ambassador Engen
       (Norway), that this would meet with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> approval.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> observed that the idea of endorsing the
        US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence is still there by implication.</p>
      <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0525"/>
      <p>As far as Lebanon is concerned, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is ready to accept
       the presence of observers and to throw as much light as possible to show that it is not
       interfering. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> said, will offer friendly advice to Lebanon to calm the situation down,
       particularly after <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is in.</p>
      <p>As regards Jordan, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> accepts the fact that
       arrangements—that is observers and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence—should be made
       to ensure there is no interference by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or anybody
       else. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence had better not be in Amman, Dr.
        <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thought, because if it is there it will be
       regarded as being the government.</p>
      <p>As regards Jordan’s future, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> went on, if it
       is a fact that Hussein can be safe in his own country, well and good. If some desire him to
       go to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to finish his studies, well and good.</p>
      <p>We cannot envisage, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said, any union with
       Lebanon or Jordan if the people do not want it—and we do not want Lebanon. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that Egypt would never have wanted Syria if the
       people in Syria had not wanted to join with Egypt. If Jordan wishes to continue as a
       nonviable state for a while, we shall say nothing, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> said, “Jordan is either too much of an expense for us or else it is too
       much of a danger to us.” It seems, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> observed,
       that her association with Iraq is the most logical course, but it is up to the Jordanians—the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cannot force them. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> wants neither too great a burden nor too great a danger.</p>
      <p>The Secretary observed that the US pays 50 million dollars to support Jordan. The moment we
       stop, the Secretary said, the situation collapses.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thought that the change-over should be
       reasonable, not sudden.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that the problem of Jordan’s future seemed to him almost insoluble.
       Perhaps, he thought, there is a future with Iraq. The Israelis believe that Iraq is dominated
       by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The Secretary commented that he did not know
       whether they would differentiate between Iraq and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or
       not.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said he did not know what direction Jordan
       will go, but thought there was a need for a breathing spell. We must not be in too much of a
       hurry. If we make clear to the Israelis and the Arabs, and if the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> makes it clear, and if the two Big Powers—the US and the Soviet Union—make it
       clear that they will not tolerate any aggression from either side, then there can be no such
       aggression. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that he had told this to
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) the
       other day, and he did not dispute it.</p>
      <p>The Secretary observed that paragraph A of the joint draft<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">See
         <ref target="#d278fn4">footnote 4, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> covers</p>
      <p>this.</p>
      <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0526"/>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> wants direct contacts outside the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> parallel to
       the action of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. It would be good, he mentioned, if we
       could envisage an agreed draft resolution—neither East nor West—something which would not
       make this an area of the cold war. We should not delay.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said we should not tinker with this resolution any more in order to please
       the Latin Americans or India. The important thing is to get an agreement with the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. You tell us you will keep hands off, and we can get our troops
       out. The Secretary said he had been observing international events since the Hague Conference
       of 1907 and had become somewhat cynical about the words that governments use. The Secretary
       said he had concluded that countries usually operate in accordance with what they think is to
       their own best interest. It seemed to him that the best interests of the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> are to keep hands off Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
      <p>There are not big enough stakes in Lebanon and Jordan, according to the Secretary, to take
       the risks of starting a war. He knew that the US wants nothing. While the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> once wanted to establish a base in Jordan, the Secretary was
       convinced they want nothing now.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> affirmed that there is nothing the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wants. We accept observers and all the guarantees, he said.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> observed that he had had no indication at
       all of how long the troops would stay and the date of their withdrawal.</p>
      <p>The Secretary replied that the heart of the matter is: what is the attitude of the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>? If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> does not keep hands
       off, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot find enough troops to stop them. But if the
       Secretary General could act quickly and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> does not
       interfere, we would pull out right away. We can be well under way by September 30.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> asked if all the troops could be out by
       September 30.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said no, since it takes longer to get out than it takes to get in; it may
       take at least 30 days to get them out.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that he wanted an approximate
       idea.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said he could not be precise. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       doesn’t want anything drastic done about troop withdrawal until after September 24th. After
       that he probably would not object to our definitely beginning to withdraw. If the United
       Nations acts and we get the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>’s assurances, it could happen
       quickly.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said he needed a parallel understanding
       with the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said we know that it has been <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> money and
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> direction coming from Cairo and from Damascus which has
       been behind much of the present situation. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> can exert
       a big influence to quiet things down and make it easier for us to get out, and make it easier
       for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to want us out.</p>
      <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said there is no point in his denying or
       admitting what the Secretary said about <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> activities. There
       is no point in saying things about other interventions which have taken place. The main thing
       is to end this confusion. We want to work in a constructive spirit, Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said. We want the United Kingdom’s assurances too because
       if they cannot withdraw, it will make your withdrawal difficult.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said we are not committed to a concurrent withdrawal with the United Kingdom
       but we have agreed to consult and we believe that the United Kingdom is sincerely anxious to
       get out.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said he thought a third resolution is the
       best answer in the United Nations.</p>

      </list>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened the conversation by saying that
       he thought it was useful at this time to exchange some views concerning the work of the
       current Session of the General Assembly.</p>
      <p>He recalled that the Secretary had expressed his opinion that it would be worthwhile to
       find a basis for constructive decisions.<note n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">See <ref target="#d268"
         >Document 268</ref>.</note> In return, he had put forward the Soviet considerations
       especially regarding their resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d280fn3">See <ref target="#d267fn8"
         >footnote 8, Document 267</ref>.</note> which had just been submitted that day.
       Subsequently, the Norwegian resolution<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">See <ref target="#d278fn3"
         >footnote 3, Document 278</ref>.</note> has been submitted. Since Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had indicated interest in the possibility of doing
       things on a constructive basis, he wanted to make clear that the Soviet attitude was that the
       Norwegian resolution was completely negative and the Soviet Union could not give it support.
       Everyone, including the US,</p>
      <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0528"/>
      <p><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Arab
       countries, concurred that what was involved was an immediate withdrawal of US and British
       troops from Lebanon and Jordan. In the Norwegian resolution, one condition after another was
       piled up. Therefore, the Soviet Union not only could not support it but resolutely rejected
       it. The Soviet resolution provided for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and
       Jordan. If the United States truly favored withdrawal, there should be no objection to this.
       The Soviet resolution also envisaged a definite role for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> in the matter. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that he
       had spoken to the Secretary in their earlier conversation about strengthening the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Observer Group in Lebanon and sending a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> Group to Jordan. The presence of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       representatives on the spot would remove any concern about external interference in the
       affairs of Lebanon. What was there in such a position that was not acceptable to the United
       States?</p>
      <p>The Secretary had said the situation was more complicated in Jordan. There was no reason to
       prevent the immediate solution of this question. The presence of a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> Group in Jordan would solve this problem. Furthermore, this General Assembly
       would have its say with regard to the question of non-interference from the outside. How does
       this not accord with the views of the United States and the United Kingdom? These
       considerations were being put forward with the thought in mind that it might be possible to
       achieve a mutual understanding in accordance with everyone’s views.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that, as he understood the situation from his earlier talk with Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, he did not feel that there was a very great
       difference between us. He did feel that the Norwegian resolution conformed to the principles
       we had discussed. The principal differences between us seem to be two. The US contemplated
       that any withdrawal of troops would have to be fitted into two other things. One, a
       declaration by the Arab countries, particularly the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>,
       reaffirming the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other states. We understood
       from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> that the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> did not object to this. There was, however, no such declaration
       in the Soviet resolution. Two, while the Soviet resolution does seem to recognize a certain
       connection between US and British withdrawal and the establishment of a strengthened <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Group in Lebanon and Jordan, there is the implication that the
       Soviet Union’s plan calls for troops to come out immediately. Of course, it would take some
       time to set up a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Group. Such a Group, however, is a common
       element in our positions and brings us closer together. Since there is no objection by the
       Arabs to a declaration of non-interference in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution,
       there seems to be no basic objection from any quarter to what the US has in mind. In
       considering the relation of withdrawal of troops to the establishment of <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery, it is not possible to withdraw without seeing how the
       machinery would function. There is a connection between the two, <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497"
        facs="0529"/>and there could be no serious objection to this. The Secretary said he did not
       see the differences that seemed to underlie the strong Soviet position against the Norwegian
       resolution.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that when the Soviets talk about a
       definite role of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the necessity of having an
       Observer Group, they do not have in mind that there should be any delay in the withdrawal of
       American and British troops. Since there was no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Group in
       Jordan, one should be set up immediately and sent within a few days. Experience showed that
       observers could be on the spot in several days—five or six days and even earlier as far as
       the capital itself was concerned. If there were agreement, observers could be sent
       simultaneously with the withdrawal of troops. Agreement could be reached and expressed in one
       or perhaps two resolutions. The Soviets did not want to derogate from the role of the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in this situation. There should be no difficulty in coming to
       agreement on the thesis of non-interference in internal affairs. There would hardly be any
       delegate of the Arab countries directly concerned who would not support this. It was
        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s understanding, however, that they would do
       so only if a solution were reached satisfactory to all concerned, which appeared a reasonable
       viewpoint to him.</p>
      <p>The Secretary recalled that he had said in the previous conversation with <persName
        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the important thing was to know whether or not the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wants to take over Lebanon and Jordan. This question
       could not just be determined by a resolution. Failure of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> to accept the principle of non-interference would amount to a suspicious
       circumstance, but even if it did accept it, there was no assurance that it would abide by its
       promise. The important thing was to make sure that the Governments of Lebanon and Jordan
       could be confident in their own minds that their two countries would be let alone. <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence would serve as a reminder that no violation of pledges
       could occur without those responsible being caught. If these two things he had been talking
       about took place the US would withdraw quickly. This could not be done in 15 minutes, of
       course. The initial contingents had been combat troops, but various support elements had
       followed them up. It would take some time to carry out the withdrawal, but if there were a
       genuine feeling that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intends to keep hands off and if
       the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were present, there could be no reason why the US
       withdrawal would not take place expeditiously. The Secretary mentioned that in his earlier
       talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> he had indicated he saw no reason
       why the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would want to take over Lebanon. It would be a
       direct liability to her. If the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> wanted Lebanon it would
       at least have to face war with Israel. There was a balance of Christians and Moslems in the
       country. Disruption of this balance would make the country a real liability for the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The Secretary thought that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> would stay out if there were a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in
       Lebanon. The US <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0530"/>wanted to get its troops out. It had
       not, as alleged, sent them there to keep <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in
       power nor to attack Iraq. There was no other reason for their being there except to keep the
       Republic of Lebanon from losing its independence. Once it was satisfied this danger did not
       exist, it would manufacture no pretext for delay but would leave promptly. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should understand that all sorts of resolutions could
       be passed, but if war broke out in the Middle East it would be difficult to keep world peace.
       Thus we must work to make a settlement that will be effective.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that there was a difference between
       the internal problem of the area and the external problem which should be the subject of
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> concern. He would deal only with the latter and the Soviet
       Union would only approach the problem of the Middle East and of Lebanon and Jordan from this
       point of view. With regard to the role of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> no one wished
       to minimize this role or its significance. The US stressed it, so did the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the British and the Arabs. Why was it not possible to
       come to agreement? The question of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s role could be
       linked with the main question of the withdrawal of troops. A <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> group could be sent to Jordan within 4 or 5 days. This would reflect the general
       feeling here. It should be possible to reach an understanding on this score with the Arab
       delegations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, however, went further. He
       discussed future plans of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had no information about any plans of the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. This was going a bit far. It was a hypothetical
       approach and could hardly be productive.</p>
      <p>The Secretary replied that, as he had said before, the important thing was to be satisfied
       that there existed no destructive purposes. If this could be achieved, there was really not
       much difference between the Soviet and US positions. The Soviets spoke about immediate
       withdrawal and related it to some kind of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. The
       situation in Lebanon was not quite this simple. There was, on the other hand, some relation
       as far as Jordan was concerned between withdrawal and the international situation. If Jordan
       disintegrated a very serious situation would result. The problem of Jordan could not be
       easily and quickly dismissed. It would not be solved just by sending a handful of observers
       to Amman. Thus, there was a reason for dealing with withdrawal from Jordan in such a way as
       to achieve sufficient order and stability there to prevent the Israelis’ claiming that the
       Armistice Agreement had been dissolved. Withdrawal from Lebanon was less complicated from
       this standpoint, but it would be necessary to pay some attention to the views of the
       Governments of Lebanon, both the outgoing and the incoming one. They are entitled to get some
       help. We could not accept the view that they are not entitled to help, but we could accept
       the possibility that help could be worked out in other ways. It was necessary to have the
       situation worked out through <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0531"/>dealings with the other
       Arab countries. The Secretary General would be negotiating with them and their cooperation
       would be necessary in order to obtain the use of their territories to get assistance to
       Jordan. All this was not a problem that could be solved simply in 4 or 5 days.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that it was necessary here to
       differentiate between two questions—the internal situation which concerned only the
       Government of Jordan, and the external situation. With regard to the internal situation, how
       was he to understand the question outlined by Secretary Dulles? Was the <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> somehow to play a part in the internal affairs there? As to the
       external situation, it was possible to achieve a satisfactory solution aimed at securing the
       political independence and territorial integrity of Jordan. There were two considerations
       involved. First, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group, apart from other functions it
       may have, would supervise the situation along the frontiers of Jordan. Would not that be a
       guarantee even against interference? Second, declarations or statements would be made by
       other states regarding non-interference. Would not these aim at the same purpose? This would
       solve the question of the preservation of Jordan as a state. This being the case, the
       question of the Armistice Agreement would not, in his opinion, arise at all.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that the sending of observers to Jordan would certainly help preserve
       the territorial integrity and the political independence of that country. Nevertheless, it
       was obvious that the group could function only in agreement with the Government of Jordan.
       Just what they did agree to he did not know. The Secretary repeated that he felt there was no
       basic difference between the American and Soviet positions, except perhaps that the Soviet
       delegation wanted the US to agree in advance to withdraw regardless of whatever would happen
       and the US wanted to see what would happen before it withdrew.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered what possible happenings there
       might be and what time period was envisaged. He suggested that the talk be concentrated more
       specifically on the time element in order that there might be a better understanding.</p>
      <p>The Secretary replied that the reference in the Norwegian resolution to a report by the
       Secretary General by September 30 meant that we expected that there should be something
       substantial to report by that time.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that during a previous conversation
       the Secretary had spoken of the possibility of US withdrawal without a request from the
       Government of Lebanon to do so. Now the Secretary did refer to such a request and was talking
       in terms of a longer period. Reference was made to “happenings”. Reference to “obscure
       happenings” and “unknown happenings” made it difficult for the Soviets to agree to our
       position. They felt that all this not only led to unnecessary delay but would not improve the
       situation. Thus they felt it was <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0532"/>necessary to reach
       agreement on the question of withdrawal, which would be useful to the great powers and to the
       peace of the world—that is, if everyone were interested in assuring peace. <persName
        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had the impression that, while Secretary
        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ line of reasoning touched many aspects of the
       situation, in the end it was limited to the provisions of the Norwegian resolution. If all
       this reasoning were simply leading up to the Norwegian resolution then he believed the scope
       of the usefulness of the talks had been narrowed down.</p>
      <p>The Secretary pointed out that, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       undoubtedly knew, the Norwegian resolution had gone through much rewriting. There had just
       been another change this morning. There was nothing any more sacred about its language now
       than there had been a few days ago. Its principles seemed sound to us. The resolution
       reaffirmed the dangers of indirect aggression. It asked the Secretary General to make
       arrangements to uphold the principles of the Charter with respect to Lebanon and Jordan. This
       might involve the people on the frontier or it might not. The Secretary General would have to
       come to a conclusion on this. The Secretary had made a declaration for the US that it would
       withdraw as soon as the Government of Lebanon requested it to do so, when the Secretary
       General had made the arrangements called for by the resolution or if the General Assembly
       itself called for the withdrawal. The provision for a report by September 30 presupposes that
       something would happen by that time. The language of the resolution had been changed many
       times. The US was not stubborn about its views. He believed that our basic ideas were not
       very different from what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had suggested. He
       hoped something like the Norwegian resolution would form a basis upon which we could all
       agree.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that he had already voiced his
       opinion about the resolution and if he spoke at greater length would only be repeating
       himself.</p>
      <p>The Secretary stated that it seemed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
       desired a mechanistic formula in the present situation. On the other hand, the United States
       supported a formula involving the principles of the United Nations. The Soviet resolution
       calls for a withdrawal of troops without delay.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interrupted to say that he meant in a
       reasonable time, of course.</p>
      <p>The Secretary continued if a suitable resolution were passed and talks held with the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and we were convinced that the situation was a stable one with
       regard to interference from the outside—, we would begin to reduce the size of our forces
       there. We had already made some reductions. There was no desire on our part to continue the
        <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0533"/>present level which served no useful purpose. It
       was not possible, however, to talk about a specific date of withdrawal. We did not know what
       the Secretary General would do or what he would recommend.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that while the Soviet resolution called
       for withdrawal without delay of American and British troops the Soviets naturally understood
       that this could not be done with rocket speed. The technical problems would require some
       small space of time. The withdrawal should, however, be carried out without delay and without
       its being surrounded with many conditions as provided in the Norwegian resolution. It was his
       opinion that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was not correct when he
       expressed the view that there was not much difference between the US and Soviet positions.
       The Soviet resolution would be more productive since it was based on general agreement and
       settlement in the interests of all concerned. He did not lose hope that Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would think over the considerations he had put forward
       and that the US would, on its own part, seek to contribute toward finding a solution in the
       interests of all concerned, the Soviet Union included.</p>
      <p>The Secretary remarked that no resolutions are perfect and that it is difficult to capture
       in them exactly what was intended. If the Soviets wanted the US and the British out, the
       Norwegian resolution would do it better than the Soviet one. When he examined the Norwegian
       resolution he did not see much that the Soviets objected to. The solution would be difficult
       if the Soviet Union injected a mechanistic resolution. Scheduling progress by ten days here
       and ten days there would not work. Much depends on what the Secretary General does and what
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> does. If arrangements between them are effective, the
       Soviets would see US troops moving out in a hurry. The Soviets had to do something on faith.
       If these arrangements were made, they would see results in a few weeks.</p>

         reasoning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was very worried that the

      <p>The Secretary said the primary reason he wanted to meet with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName> was to talk about Jordan. He said that if the Arab resolution<note n="2"
        xml:id="d285fn2">See <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> were passed, as he hoped
       it would be, it would involve extensive commitments regarding respect by the nations in the
       area for the independence and integrity of each other. The resolution would lead to an
       expectation throughout the world that the situation in the Near East would be greatly
       improved. If in these circumstances the situation in Jordan should soon explode, the good
       faith of certain countries would be called into question. He therefore welcomed an
       opportunity to talk about this with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> on a
       friendly and intimate basis.</p>
      <p>The Jordan Government wanted more in the way of financial and other commitments than we
       felt able to extend. They were thinking in terms of some 50 to 100 million dollars per year,
       over an extended period. On the other hand, if the situation in Jordan should be permitted to
       disintegrate, that would almost certainly bring about internal chaos giving rise to a real
       danger of renewed Arab/Israel hostilities. We, therefore, should find some basis for
       cooperation in deciding what should be done with respect to Jordan. If the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> really wanted to take over Jordan, they could probably do so
       since the United States was not willing to go to all lengths, including a commitment for
       substantial financial assistance over an extended period of time, to keep Jordan out of
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hands. One question was, however, what would happen to
       Jordan, including the many refugees there, if the present regime should be ousted and the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should not be in a position to assume the enormous
       financial responsibility for the country. That was apart from the question of the likely
       Israeli reaction to various contingencies.</p>
      <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0540"/>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> recalled that he had spoken briefly with
       Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> about this question, and that he had
       said the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was ready to keep an open mind regarding various
       alternatives. He could state that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was willing to
       cooperate in a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Jordan. He thought the
       choice of Jordan’s future might well be between the Arab states assuming the burden for that
       country, or in continuing a situation in which Jordan would constitute an opening for
       intervention by foreign countries. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> itself would be
       very happy to see some close relationship between Jordan and Iraq.</p>
      <p>The Secretary inquired whether Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> foresaw any
       possibility that King Hussein would accept an association with Iraq, to which Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> replied that “neither the bride nor the bridegroom would
       be eager, but perhaps they could be persuaded”.</p>
      <p>The Secretary emphasized the need for bringing about in an orderly way whatever change was
       to be made, since a change through disorder would be extremely dangerous. Time, therefore,
       would be required. He would prefer that nothing be precipitated in Jordan but that it be held
       as at present for at least two or three months until things could be permitted to settle
       down. Whether or not this could be accomplished, the Secretary did not know.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
        >Murphy</persName> had told them in Cairo that he did not think Hussein would abdicate. He
       realized, of course, that that could not be taken as a last answer. If Hussein’s friends felt
       that he could be safe in Jordan, he might continue on there, but frankly Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thought this doubtful. He considered it to be better
       advice to King Hussein that he continue his studies in England. In any event, however, the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would not resist his staying in Jordan.</p>
      <p>The Secretary did not see a permanent future for Jordan as an independent nation. It had
       always been maintained by foreign contributions. There was, however, no easy alternative. It
       would be more logical from the political and economic viewpoints to bring about an
       association of Jordan with Iraq. He did not think that could be achieved at the moment
       without violence. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> agreed and said there was
       no need to rush. Several months might be required to bring about an orderly transition.
       Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would willingly accept appropriate <gloss
        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arrangements.</p>
      <p>The Secretary inquired whether Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> thought
       that, if the British should withdraw and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> establish a
       presence in Jordan, King Hussein could stay on for a few months longer. Dr. <persName
        corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> replied that he might be able to do so; the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would cooperate.</p>
      <p>The Secretary observed that if Hussein should go and if an interim government should come
       in which was committed to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, it would not be possible
       for the US to put up the money to maintain the Jordanian economy. Thus the inauguration of a
       new regime in Jordan <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0541"/>would immediately precipitate
       that issue which we would not wish to arise right away. He said we would continue to support
       King Hussein for a few months longer, but if he should be overthrown by violence and a
        pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime installed, American public opinion
       would preclude any financial aid. That was another factor which rendered it highly desirable
       to bring about in an orderly way any change that might take place.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> said that these considerations were very
       much in his mind. If Hussein should be overthrown and the new regime should ask the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to take over financial responsibility, the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> could not afford to do so. He was aware that there was a whole
       complex of problems including the question of who would care for the Palestinian refugees now
       in Jordan. It would be sensible to explore how far the Iraqis might be prepared to go back to
       the Arab Union concept. If <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> advice meant anything, they
       would certainly advise their friends in Jordan, particularly of Palestinian origin, to keep
       quiet for the time being. The Secretary said that we would continue to put up money in Jordan
       on a temporary basis. We should try to figure out together how there could be developed a
       satisfactory solution to the problem in order to give Jordan some basis for its existence
       other than foreign contribution, and how to bring about any changes that may be decided upon
       without precipitating an Arab-Israel war. He said the young King had shown great courage and
       determination, but he was now in a mood whereby it was hard to predict what action he might
       take. If he felt himself too hard-pressed, he might assume the attitude of Samson and
       endeavor to pull down the pillars, bringing about a collapse of the whole situation.</p>
      <p>The Secretary concluded by saying he was worried about the Jordanian situation and hoped
       that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> would seriously consider what might be
       done in the context of the problem as they had discussed it.</p>
      <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> seemed to welcome the discussion.</p>

      <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, in his remarks to the

       Norwegian resolution, but concluded that in substance the two resolutions were similar. He
       applauded the fact that the countries involved in the controversy had found it possible to
       agree on concerted action as a result of the emergency session of the General Assembly, and
       he reiterated that the United States desired “at the earliest possible moment" to withdraw
       its forces from Lebanon. (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> Press Release 2983, printed

       conversation on August 21, that the resolution would rehabilitate and invigorate the Arab
       League, and the Israelis were unhappy about that. Eisenhower still felt that the Arab
       resolution looked good and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed. (Memorandum

        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> talked with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

       which he personally has little confidence. He did agree that resolution might cause <persName

       inquired when he expected visit <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> Hammarskjold, he
       replied probably next week/ten days. Rifai again reiterated oft-repeated <gloss
        target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> position of no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police force,
       no <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>, no radio broadcast monitoring teams unless

       advance pro-position under which <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> would establish

         (he dismissed as excuse necessity congressional action) holds key our over-all approach
         Middle East problem. He said convinced certain arrangements have already been made between
         ourselves and British at Foreign Office level under which we have abdicated our short-lived
         position leadership Middle East, turned over implementation joint Anglo-American policy to
         British while we agree provide necessary funds. I asked him to explain this statement. He
         replied Jordan is a non-viable state, created originally by British in their own national
         interest. As such it can exist only so long subsidized or permitted federate other states,
         alternative is its dismemberment/absorption. US Government never had compelling
         military/economic reasons take on burden subsidizing Jordan, did so only under extreme
         pressure events result abortive Suez affair when British forced withdraw temporarily Middle
         East stage. British position quite different. Jordan their creation, feel have prior claim
         its use, achievement their national objectives Middle East which now requires Jordan be
         brought into line with its Arab neighbors. Under present circumstances Hashemite Jordan
         only Kingdom among modern sister Arab States. Saud can be dealt with as paramount Sheik
         along with Emirs of Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, but Hussein is recognized King, creates
         embarrassment any attempt work out broad approach common problems other Arab states which
         are republics. Rifai conclusion British have decided Hussein must eventually go as price
         Jordan accommodation its surrounding neighbors who have economic noose securely fastened
         around its neck. New government would be republic orientated toward <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss>/Iraq. Federation with Iraq along lines defunct AU possible if Hashemite
         monarchy overthrown, replaced by republic. However order accomplish foregoing essential
         Jordan be weakened militarily to point it no longer constitutes threat <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> neighbors. To this end British do not desire expansion Jordan
         Army, what they really want is dissolutioned 10, 000-man national guard further “weeding
         out” present army now at only 65 percent strength and creation two additional units which
         would be considerably less than total strength former national guard. Army would not be
         streamlined or equipped new weapons but rather be permitted deteriorate into glorified
         policy force capable bearing only small arms/light weapons. Rifai said information I had
         brought fitted perfectly into his already nearly completed picture of British return power
         Jordan, acceptance/endorsement this fact by US policy makers.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>I expressed appreciation his views and reminded him extensive US military/economic aid
       which continued flow into Jordan. Rifai swept this aside saying “you have not given me a
       favorable reply to any major requests since before Iraqi revolt. Whatever is being done in
       Jordan now is result negotiations concluded months ago.” I replied that despite fact our
       response may not have been as specific or to the</p>
      <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>
      <p>degree he might have wielded [<hi rend="italic">wanted</hi>?] I hoped it was sufficiently
       reassuring to cause him continue his splendid fight against Communism in defense
       integrity/independence Jordan. He replied on contrary it had given him conclusive evidence
       that Jordan could not rely on US Government provide King/quantity military/financial (to
       support expanded armed forces) assistance with which present pro-western government could
       long remain in power. He was absolutely sure best course for him personally perhaps Jordan
       lay in change government, complete reorientation its foreign policy re sister Arab States. He
       intends: <list>

        <label>(B)</label>

       </list></p>
      <p>In view his far-reaching decision I said I would appreciate opportunity see King Hussein (I
       have an audience with King tonight). As I was about leave I inquired of Rifai what he thought
       King Hussein’s reaction reference telegram likely be. He replied it will be just about what
       you have heard from me. I asked in event Hussein refuses accept Rifai’s resignation would he
       be willing continue on temporarily. He replied negative, said Amman too small place keep such
       secret long, opposition would seize opportunity press King immediate change in
       government.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Rifai reaction about what I had expected, significant he
       remained unusually calm throughout our two-hour meeting but gave appearance “beaten man”.
       Although he will undoubtedly pin blame on us for what he will term “letting him down” I
       believe overwhelming economic/internal/political problems likely cause his decision. There is
       of course always possibility he may reconsider or King may ask him to continue for limited
       period. I hope learn more about this aspect during my conversation King Hussein tonight.</p>

         neutralist role Saudi Arabia, presence “imperialist occupation forces”
         Jordan/Lebanon.</item>
        <label>(B)</label>
        <item>Hussein believes good possibility <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will
         seek develop idea put forward during <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> meeting that Arab
         states “one family,” should resolve own differences. Under <gloss target="#t_UN1"
          >UN</gloss> compulsion temporary restraint over subversive activities within other states
          <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will take position neither Jordan nor
         Lebanon in danger external aggression/subversion, therefore US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
          >UK</gloss> troops should be immediately withdrawn. Should either Jordan or Lebanon
         protest they will be left open charge they “imperialist satellite.” Hussein opinion this
         very probably be raised by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> representative at September
         6 meeting Political Committee, Arab League, which may develop into full League meeting.
         Furthermore, if troops have not left before opening regular session <gloss target="#t_GA1"
          >GA</gloss> next month Soviets already on record place withdrawal issue on <gloss
          target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> agenda. Hussein takes position in light foregoing British
         troops must be out Jordan not later than October 1. American forces due number involved may
         be able “stall along for month or so” but size British contingent Amman cannot justify
         similar procedure.</item>
        <label>(C)</label>
        <item>Hussein convinced <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> “handmaiden” Russia,
         believes it not unlikely at September meeting Arab League he will make appeal rid Arab
         world dependence “Western aid”, will make counter-offer (with Soviet money and due apology
         for past failure fulfill commitments) replace US aid Jordan with financial support from the
         sister <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0549"/>Arab States.” Hussein points up refusal any
         such offer regardless whether or not real source money, true motive behind scheme known
         would be most embarrassing Jordan, make it target <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> charge being “imperialist satellite.” This is reason why Jordan insists
         on some kind formal and public arrangement with USG which will provide complete package

        <item>Rifai interrupted, pointed out unless <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> had good
         grounds turn down any Arab aid public opinion within country would create very difficult
         internal security problem, leave government exposed charge it “tool imperialist.” Hussein
         concluded with statement because foregoing reasons he convinced unless USG willing comply
         his request re mutual defense treaty, expansion armed forces, sufficient financial support
         alleviate budgetary difficulties he would have no alternative but accept Prime Minister
         Rifai’s resignation with its obvious anti-West consequences. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of
          source text not declassified</hi>] I thanked him for his very detailed informative
         explanation, expressed my conviction if Hussein/RIFAI realistic their approach problem

         suggested we get down to hard facts.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>I asked on assumption British troops withdrawn October 1 (obvious Jordanian security forces
       could not be expanded within next few weeks) whether Hussein/RIFAI believed <gloss

           Jordan’s limited resources including rehabilitation Amman/Ma’an railway, Aqaba port
           development, some assistance completion desert road. Hussein said he wished make clear he
           would not entertain any proposal which would make it appear to Jordanian people and/or
           other Arab States he had entered into defense agreement with British. He emphasized that
           when British paratroopers left he wanted “former Glubb Pasha crowd now in Jordan go <pb
            n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0550"/>with them.” I cautioned Hussein/RIFAI on viewing
           everything British did with suspicion pointing out from personal observation many ex-Arab
           Legion officers had deep affection Jordan as well their old comrades in arms which should
           not be regarded as part some sinister plot. Furthermore, US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
            >UK</gloss> policies many areas world quite parallel. British sources military
           supplies/equipment often used under <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> which affords
           considerable benefit not only <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> but all free countries by

           pointed out for reasons contained reference telegram any US/<gloss target="#t_HKJ1"
            >HKJ</gloss> military defense treaty out of question this time. As matter of fact, USG
           already doing in large measure what they requested particularly in economic/financial
           support field with military assistance in form planes, tanks, artillery, vehicles already
           delivered or on order running into millions of dollars. Furthermore, as near as could be
           determined no one including Hussein/RIFAI knew precisely whether Jordan Army needed or
           could usefully employ additional two brigades contained original proposals.</item>
         </list></item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In light foregoing it seems to me hard-core Hussein request was for some kind public
       announcement by USG its support Jordan at same time spelling in economic/military/financial
       terms size/nature assistance. I said if Hussein/RIFAI agreeable I would forward this
       suggestion my government with understanding no action Rifai resignation and/or notification
       British withdrawal their troops should be made meantime. Hussein/RIFAI agreed with
       stipulation USG response must be received prior <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss>
       departure from Jordan for reasons outlined reference telegram. Further, all dates re
       resignation/troop withdrawal cited reference telegram should be considered firm unless

       made this morning on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to make a firm
       representation over shooting of American soldier by rebels from the Basta which is being
       reported separately by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> to JCS,<note

        241401Z to <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>,
        August 24, <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> reported on the representations
        he had made to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> that day concerning the
        wounding of a U.S. soldier near a roadblock in the Basta. <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
         >Holloway</persName> insisted that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> take
        forceful action against insurgent forces defending the roadblock or he would use U.S. forces
        to do so. He further insisted on action before the end of the day. <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> felt that it was critical that any such action be taken
        by Lebanese forces. Although he had scheduled a meeting for the following day with rebel
        leaders to discuss opening the Basta, he issued immediate orders for the action which
         <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> demanded. (National Archives and Records
        Administration, RG 218, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Files; included in the
        microfiche supplement)</note> General informed us that tomorrow he is arranging a meeting of
       all rebel leaders in Lebanon with objectives of opening up Beirut and other towns.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had sent Jumblatt to Damascus to
       discuss with Syrian authorities cessation of further intervention here. Jumblatt had now
       returned and would attend tomorrow’s meeting. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       described change in situation following passage of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
       resolution as almost miraculous so far as Lebanon was concerned. Fact that Arab League
       delegates had devised resolution had impact on Moslem half of population; while fact <gloss
        target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> as a whole had unanimously adopted resolution gave feeling of
       reassurance to Christian half of population.</p>
      <p>It was against background of Jumblatt’s negotiations in Syria plus acceptance of <gloss
        target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       felt there was a 90 percent chance that tomorrow’s meeting would be successful in securing
       progressive opening of Beirut and in particular the Basta. Apparently he envisages a time
       phasing by which shops would initially open until noon with eventual restoration of normal
       trade throughout city in a short time.</p>
      <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> initially was apprehensive that
       limited military action called for by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"
        >Holloway</persName> might jeopardize his negotiations with opposition leaders tomorrow, I
       later had definite impression that our representation and his consequent action will in fact
       be used by General <persName>to</persName> strengthen his hand in dealing with rebel leaders,
       because</p>
      <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0555"/>
      <p>he can indicate a very firm intention on part of US command to protect its forces by US

      <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Foster</hi>: Since my return to London I have been discussing
       with Harold the future of Jordan, and I have also heard that there has been discussion about
       this between the Embassy and your people.</p>
      <p>To my mind the main point is this. The West cannot be expected to carry Jordan
       indefinitely, and the time may come when it will suit us best that the burden should be taken
       over by her neighbors or by some international organisation. But this must take some time and
       unless something urgent is done Jordan may well disintegrate in the immediate future. I
       believe that if this were to happen it would be disastrous from the point of view of
       U.S./U.K. prestige. It will stultify all the efforts you and we have put forward if the
       moment our troops leave the Middle East Jordan collapses and the country is taken over by the
       U.A.R. If this occurs, we will be regarded as having suffered a major diplomatic and actual
       defeat. It will be a great blow to our prestige in the Middle East and no one there would
       rely on either of us again. It might even be unwelcome to the U.A.R. itself which would be
       presented with a burden too difficult for it to carry (I got very much this impression from
       my talk with <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> in New York). Finally there will be
       a serious risk of war breaking out, since the Israelis would clearly not stand by and see the
       whole of Jordan taken over by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
      <p>I doubt if there is any possibility of Jordan carrying on if the King and
        <persName>Samir</persName> throw in their hands. It is clear from the messages they have
       been sending you that they are not prepared to carry on unless they get some firm assurances.
       Though the regime may not be a <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0556"/>perfect one in many
       ways, I see no possibility of replacing it by anything better in the immediate future, and I
       therefore think we ought to consider what we can do to help.</p>
      <p>What seems to me necessary to keep Jordan going is: <list>
        <label>(a)</label>
        <item>immediate easements of specific difficulties, e.g. cessation of propaganda,
         facilitation of oil supplies, reopening air communications, etc.;</item>
        <label>(b)</label>
        <item>help in raising of new units;</item>
        <label>(c)</label>
        <item>a promise of assistance to the country’s finances for the time being.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>As to (a), I have asked our Ambassador in Amman to put certain points to Hammarskjold when
       he arrives<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">Secretary-General Hammarskjöld arrived in Amman on
        August 26 for 3 days of talks with Hussein and Rifai, in pursuance of the resolution adopted
        by the General Assembly on August 21. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
         Secretaries-General of the United Nations</hi>. Vol. IV: <hi rend="italic"><persName
          corresp="#p_HD3">Dag Hammarskjöld</persName>, 1958–1960</hi>, p. 200)</note> so that he
       can discuss them in the area.</p>
      <p>As to (b), we are informing your people that we are prepared to offer one million dollars
       and to discuss how equipment shall be provided.</p>
      <p>As to (c), we are very anxious to know your intentions. We assume that you have already to
       some extent budgeted for support for Jordan over a certain period, but we understand that you
       have not been prepared so far to let them know for more than a month in advance how much you
       are prepared to do. I quite see the reason for this in the present precarious situation, but
       I think that unless we can allow them to see a little further ahead than this they will not
       consider it worth while to carry on. I think it is really essential to give the King and
       Government some kind of assurance that their budget will be taken care of for at least a year
       from now. Your people probably know better than mine what the amount involved is, but I fear
       it is not likely to be less that $50 million. You know of course how difficult our own
       financial situation is, but if the above estimate turns out to be approximately correct I am
       prepared to recommend to my colleagues that we should produce $5 million towards this (in
       addition to the million dollars already promised for equipment of the extra brigade), if you
       can meet the rest.</p>
      <p>My feeling is that we ought to make an early offer of this kind to the Jordanians, in order
       to keep Jordan afloat while a United Nations operation there is put into effect. We must hope
       that as part of this there will be set up some form of Middle East Development Organisation
       on to which we can eventually unload the responsibility for supporting Jordan; indeed I think
       the Jordanians themselves would prefer this to indefinite support by Western aid. But unless
       we can bridge the <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0557"/>gap in this way the whole
       situation may collapse before Hammarskjold can build anything up, and perhaps even before our
       troops can get out. It looks as if we ought to be able to tell the Jordanians something about
       this at the very latest before they go to the meeting of the Political Committee of the Arab
       League on September 6, and clearly it will be much better for them to be informed about it
       during Hammarskjold’s forthcoming visit to Amman. I hope that you can take an early decision
       in this sense.</p>

      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s message to the Secretary<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2"
         ><ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> had raised several questions. We could not
       at this time address ourselves to the long range problems of Jordan, nor could we now spell
       out the manner in which we might achieve our objectives. However, our thinking seemed to be
       along the same general lines as that of the British. Our immediate and pressing problem was
       how we might reply to the questions put to us by Hussein and Rifai.</p>
      <p>There seemed to be some confusion in the minds of Hussein and Rifai, Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said, as to what they actually wanted. For example,
       they had requested a mutual defense treaty with the United States, knowing that it would be
       impossible for us to agree. One could only speculate on the motives behind their threats to
       resign: possibly they were attempting to pressure us into giving them additional aid and
       possibly they were seriously contemplating such action and were setting the stage for such an
       eventuality.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood suggested that Hussein and Rifai were putting pressure on us now so that they
       might go to the Arab League meeting on September 6 with full assurance of aid from us.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> agreed that it was desirable to give
       Hussein and Rifai a feeling of security but at this stage we were limited as to what we might
       do. We must be careful not to give the Arab countries an opportunity to place on us the onus
       for failure to implement the Arab Resolution. Furnishing two additional brigades to the
       Jordanian Army <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0560"/>might have this unfortunate result.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> handed Lord Hood a draft of our proposed
       telegram to Amman,<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">The telegram, as revised and sent to Amman on
        August 27, is <ref target="#d301">Document 301</ref>.</note> which Lord <persName
        corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> read.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood commented that in his opinion the draft telegram was too vague and made no
       concrete offer. He wondered if we might suggest to the Jordanian Government that we were
       prepared to begin discussing with them plans to equip the two brigades. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that we were not now prepared to discuss this
       subject with the Jordanians. We did not have the funds available and, should we decide to
       equip the brigades, the money would have to be taken from a different program. We were not
       even convinced that the two brigades were desirable. The existence of the Arab Resolution
       raised grave questions in our own minds as to the extent of aid we should give Jordan at this
       point. We were not now prepared either to say we would equip the brigades or that we would
       not.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood said that in his opinion the two brigades were the absolute minimum of what we
       might do to encourage Hussein and Rifai to continue in office. We should give them these
       assurances now. It was apparent that the King needed additional reliable troops and the
       equipping of two Bedouin brigades seemed to be the answer. Current thinking, he added, was
       that arms for the two brigades might come from unreliable units of the Jordan Army which were
       being demobilized on the West Bank. It would be important to discuss what we were willing to
       do in this line with the Jordanians before the Arab League meeting on September 6. The second
       important factor, Lord Hood continued, was to give Hussein and Rifai some assurance for the
       future on the financial side and to spell out exactly what might be available to Jordan. The
       Secretary of State had hoped that the US could commit $50 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
        >FY</gloss> 1959 rather than to dole out relatively small sums on a month-to-month ad hoc
       basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> pointed out the difficulty of
       committing long-term funds to a country such as Jordan, whose bookkeeping is far from
       efficient. If we were to carry the financial burden of equipping these brigades, our economic
       assistance to Jordan would necessarily have to be reduced.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood commented that the US was apparently not prepared at this time to undertake to
       supplement the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> offer of $5 million of aid for <gloss
        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959. He again reiterated that the telegram was unfortunately too
       vague and asked if it could not be more precise.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> suggested that he and Lord Hood discuss
       this matter further with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and
       Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> at a meeting which was arranged
       for 5:30 the same afternoon.</p>

      <p>1311. General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and I made a 360 degree “tour
       d’horizon” this morning of Lebanese political, economic and military situation. Despite
       rather clipped accents which I had been forced to use Sunday night when I declined General
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s request that General Adams tanks not be
       deployed along our lines of communications, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       could not have been more forthcoming and friendly. Following points emerged: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item>General said he had been furious when opposition leaders came to his house Sunday
         night (cf Embassy telegram 1269)<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2"><ref target="#d294">Document
           294</ref>.</note> with seven-point manifesto summarized Embassy telegram 1293.<note n="3"
          xml:id="d299fn3">Telegram 1293 from Beirut, August 26, reported that opposition leaders
          met on August 25 at the house of <persName>Saeb Salam</persName> to adopt a seven-point
          program of concerted action affirming a unity of purpose and calling for support for
           <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s announced national program, and for the
          immediate evacuation of U.S. forces. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/8–2658;
          included in the microfiche supplement)</note> He had told rebel leaders who gathered with
         him at Junieh (Jumblat, Rashid Karame, Fuad Ammoun, Abdullah Yafi, Hassan Queini and
          <persName>Sabri Hamadeh</persName>) that what he wanted was a declaration opening Beirut
         and foreswearing acts of violence. Instead he had a political manifesto which did not help
         matters at all but would in fact give ammunition to Christian loyalists to insist on
         reprisals against Moslem opposition. General said rebel leaders who visited him were of
         more moderate stripe and he had noted that leaders from outside Beirut were much more
         inclined to take a reasonable position than those locked up with <persName>Saeb
          Salaam</persName> in the Basta. He said it was clear that manifesto took its truculent
         tone from fact it had been drafted in <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>’s house where each
         leader felt he had to outshout the other.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item>As to realities of situation, General said that despite apparent intransigence of
         opposition, in fact more moderate leaders had intimated that progressively Basta would
         open. Vast majority of population in that quarter were eager to resume business and despite
         insistence on a continuation of “Pacific general strife,” he was confident rebel leadership
         would turn a blind eye toward shopkeepers who gradually lifted their shutters.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item>On security situation General said he was prudently optimistic. He admitted stationing
         of United States tanks on United States line of communications along airport road had had a
         beneficial effect on opposition. They knew we meant business and also were aware that <pb
          n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0562"/>presence of American fire power made task of Lebanese
         army more easy. Although after elections <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had
         given orders for his troops to observe a cease-fire, these orders had been changed
         following recent acts of sniping and terrorism and, as last night’s fire fight near airport
         road revealed when rebels lost half a dozen men, fire was now horizontal, not vertical. So
         far as safety of Americans was concerned, General said our families could return at
         once.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>Reverting to opposition attitudes and in particular insistence on immediate withdrawal
         of American forces, General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had told
         opposition leaders Sunday that they were creating a vicious circle for themselves. He has
         said flatly US forces would not be withdrawn until security situation in Lebanon had been
         restored to normal. It was therefore up to opposition itself to cooperate in restoring
         security if they wished to achieve their goal of departure of US forces. <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had reminded opposition US command was just as eager
         as they for withdrawal of our troops and had given earnest of this by reembarkment of a
         Marine BLT. He, the General, would favor our remaining here however until acts of violence
         had ceased.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>Re Hammarskjold’s visit to Middle East and attitude toward retention of <gloss
          target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he
         was inclined to feel <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer force could be built up in
         numbers to act as a sort of umbrella over Lebanon until future was more clear. He thought
         this particularly important in connection with eventual withdrawal of US troops.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item>General confirmed report <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1292<note n="4"
          xml:id="d299fn4">Dated August 26. (Department of State, Central Files,
          783A.00/8–2658)</note> that he had arranged transportation for Syrian commandos from Basta
         back to their homeland.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had taken action on my
         suggestion (para 7 <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1130)<note n="5"
          xml:id="d299fn5"><ref target="#d274">Document 274</ref>.</note> for attempting to reopen
         channels of commerce with Syria and Arabian hinterland. His negotiations in Damascus had
         borne results. Syrians had indicated their readiness to provide full cooperation for free
         transit of trains, trucks, people and goods but with caveat “they wanted no credit to
         accrue to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>”. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> grinned and said he thought this could be arranged. He likewise said he
         had been pleasantly surprised when Syrians and Egyptians had informed him Egyptians were
         prepared to drop embargo on Lebanese apples, again with proviso <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> would not get credit. Apparently a delegation will be cooked up to
         call <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as President-elect and literally offer
         him the apple of accord.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item>Noforn: General wishes following information to be closely held. He says he
         contemplates a 6-month period of emergency powers during which Parliament will be asked to
         stand down “as I do not want to be bothered with antics of those politicians”. He
         contemplates <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0563"/>appointing a government of relatively
         little known moderates accepting no outstanding leaders either from opposition or fanatic
         loyalists. He looks toward a businesslike half-year in which to bind up the nation’s
         wounds, conciliate factional strife, and get ahead with being a peaceful small country once
         again. From his reference to opposition fears of arrest under present regime I got broad
         inference an amnesty would be an early order of business once <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> assumes power.</item>

      </list>
      <p>Pursuant to Lord Hood’s inquiry on whether the United States could say something more
       definite to the <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> on budgetary aid than proposed in the
       earlier draft telegram Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said technicians
       within the Department had been at work on a revised draft message. They have prepared a new
       draft which is acceptable to them and which should be satisfactory if Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> approves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> then read the proposed telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2"><ref
         target="#d301"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi></ref>.</note> In the discussion which followed
       Lord Hood said that the British offer to contribute $5 million against a United States
       contribution of $45 million was intended to provide support to Jordan over the next 12 months
       and that if the United States planning covered only the next six months, i.e. to the end of
       the current <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> fiscal year (March 30, 1959), then the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> contribution would presumably amount to $2.5 million. Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>, while evidencing disappointment in the
       effect of this on current budget planning, did not think the United States could commit
       itself beyond the <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0564"/>present Jordan <gloss
        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
        >Herter</persName>’s concern that the United States offer might be construed as a commitment
       to any Government in Jordan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said this
       would not be so, since our offer was being made only to King Hussein and Rifai.</p>
      <p>The second aspect of the telegram in which Lord Hood was interested related to the
       establishment of 2 brigades. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said this
       had given us considerable difficulty; he prepared to say more than that the matter was under
       consideration and that the Department hoped to be able to inform <gloss target="#t_HKJ1"
        >HKJ</gloss> of our views as soon as possible. It was agreed that the United States would
       seek the views of our Chargé on these brigades: on whether both are necessary, the purpose
       for which they are to be organized, the problem of financing them, and his recommendations.
       Mr. <persName>Dorman</persName> was to prepare a message asking for the Chargé’s views on
       these points and requesting the Chargé to consult with the British Ambassador in the
       preparation of his reply.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">A telegram posing these questions was
        sent to Amman on August 28. (Telegram 677 to Amman; Department of State, Central Files,
        785.00/8–2858; included in the microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s inquiry as to whether
       Secretary General Hammarskjold should be informed of our intention to supply economic aid, it
       was agreed our Chargé in Amman would be instructed to so inform him; if the Embassy had
       difficulty, however, in reaching Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> the Chargé would
       advise the Department and some other channel would be used to keep him informed of our
       offer.</p>

        <item>USG had demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt it willing/able make substantial
         contribution maintenance Jordan’s integrity/independence. Question now remains whether
         Hussein/RIFAI on their side prepared continue fight which to date characterized by their
         great courage/determination defend free world principles. Rifai said first wished me convey
         my government his personal appreciation as well that Jordan Government “this indisputable

      <p>I said hoped that what I consider be generous US offer would put end further talks his
       (RIFAI) resignation as Prime Minister or King Hussein’s abdication. He readily agreed adding
       while undoubtedly negotiations would be required work out details general framework USG
       proposal sufficiently broad provide room maneuver. I said while statement this position
       welcome/appreciated, I felt obliged request audience with King in order hear at first hand
       his reaction. Rifai said <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0568"/>he had meeting with Hussein

      <p>I told Hussein/RIFAI their determination continue fight maintain independence/integrity
       Jordan most welcome, should set at rest press speculative stories re Rifai’s

       which obtains here, particularly with respect degree govt control of country and overall
       security picture. Info available on conditions outside Beirut still fragmentary and not
       completely reliable. One prominent political figure estimates 80 percent Lebanon and over
       half towns outside govt authority. Emb believes 60 percent more realistic estimate. Following
       represents attempt by Emb to present as clear a picture as possible subject foregoing

       <item><p><hi rend="italic">Outside Beirut:</hi> Govt or govt sympathizers generally control
         seacoast from Tripoli south to Israeli border. EmbOff recently in Tripoli told by local Leb
         army commander there were still several hundred Syrians in or about Tripoli; there are
         strong armed bands of <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> and Phalangists as well, and govt
         has made no attempt disarm them. Tripoli itself calm but with serious unemployment problem.
         Same informant estimated a thousand Syrians still in Akkar.</p>
        <p>Area south of Tripoli and east to Bekaa (traditional Christian Mount Lebanon) under
         nominal govt control, largely because in hands Christian feudal families. These families
         not all pro-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>; they carry on traditional family
         feuds which cut across political lines and make it difficult judge events in terms
         loyalists and opposition. However, <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0572"/>area definitely
         not in Moslem opposition orbit, although one faction <persName>Zghorta</persName> area
         irreconcilably anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and cooperating with
         opposition.</p>
        <p>In south Lebanon govt appears in loose control of area bounded by line Sidon–Marjayoun on
         north and Leb-Israeli border on south. This does not exclude feuding such as ancient
         quarrel between Shi’a factions in Tyre area. Sidon and Tyre open except for old cities,
         which are restricted areas of Basta type. South Bekaa and area east to Syrian border
         no-man’s land occasionally penetrated by govt patrols in daylight. Central Bekaa north of
         Beirut–Damascus road to Rayak apparently under govt control. North Bekaa situation one of
         lawlessness, brigandage and spotty control by local elements strong enough exercise own
         authority.</p>
        <p>Beirut–Damascus road open to border but probably not hundred percent safe. Railroad to
         Damascus has on several occasions been reported ready resume; now appears in operation but
         could easily be interrupted again.</p>
        <p>In sum, may be said seacoast from Tripoli south to Israeli border plus corresponding
         territory inland to crest Lebanon range is either in nominal govt control or at least not
         in hands active opposition. One exception is Upper Chouf area held by Kamal Jumblat and his
         Druze followers. Should also be noted that in some cases control by local leaders who,
         although violently anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, are not for
         opposition, extends over Lebanon range to edge Bekaa. Kairouz clan, Bcharre, best example

        >Telegram 686 from Amman, August 29, reported on the text of the agreement reached that day
        by Rifai and Hammarskjöld concerning the implementation of the resolution adopted by the
        General Assembly. The agreement provided, in part, that there would be no <gloss
         target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> police force or observer teams established in Jordan, that the
         <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> presence in Jordan would be brought about through the
        establishment of a “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Representative Office” in Amman headed
        by a <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> official with the rank of ambassador, provided that
        similar but subordinate offices were established in Cairo, Baghdad, and Beirut. The
        agreement further specified that the withdrawal of British troops would be subject to
        satisfaction on the part of the Jordanian Government that other Arab States had demonstrated
        willingness to live up to their pledges under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
        resolution. Hammarskjöld pressed for a specific date to be established for the British
        withdrawal, and Rifai agreed that September 30 was a reasonable target date, providing that
        the conditions for withdrawal had been met. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 315/8–2958;

       morning on General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> (military aspects of which
       are separately reported to <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> by Admiral),<note n="2"
        xml:id="d307fn2">Not found.</note> I continued review of political and security situation

      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said that following his stormy reaction to
       rebel manifesto last Sunday, he had discerned a definite trend toward second thoughts in
       opposition leadership. He was particularly encouraged that Rachid Karame, leader of rebellion
       in Tripoli, had come to Beirut for sole purpose of attempting to reason with leadership in
       the Basta with view to gradual re-opening of that quarter and a phased lifting of general
       strike throughout Lebanon. Other elements at work included <persName>Takieddine
        Solh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s political adviser, and
        <persName>Yusef Salam</persName> acting as head of the powerful syndicate of industrialists
       and merchants.</p>
      <p>An important factor of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s negotiations with
       opposition would be offer of possibility of reembarkation of additional US troop units.
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in consequence welcomed <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>’s suggestion for possible retraction of a marine BLT
       by 15 September. However, we all agreed this plan should be most closely held in order to
       permit <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> to make offer to rebel leadership to use
       his best influence on <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1">CINCSPECOMME</gloss> for withdrawal of
       BLT in return for real progress on their side in opening Beirut and reestablishment of
       security.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> seemed reasonably confident that by a
       combination of carrot and stick methods the Basta could commence to return to a normal state
       and seemed to anticipate strike might at least be alleviated tomorrow or Tuesday.</p>
      <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>
      <p>My current reading of situation that provided means can be found of saving oriental face
       and above plan (as I expect) <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> can intimate to
       rebel leaders they may anticipate amnesty after he takes office, general strike should
       commence to wane next week. I therefore fully concur with <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1"
        >CINCSPECOMME</gloss>’s recommendation both as to phased withdrawal and return of official
       dependents by mid-September.</p>
      <p>Re formation of new government following his assumption of presidency September 24,
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he was insisting to both opposition and
       loyalist factions on three principles: (1) unity, (2) pacification and (3) work. He said no
       person would be invited to enter next cabinet who did not observe these 3 principles. He
       added wryly this would eliminate a number of politicians.</p>

       outlined step by step events leading up to his request US military assistance including
       mutual defense treaty [garble] establishment <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Jordan. He
       spelled out in precise terms what he considered Jordan’s basic military requirements: <list>

        <item>Recruitment among loyal Bedouin tribes sufficient personnel create two new brigades

        <label>(C)</label>
        <item>Complete re-equipment other four army brigades with new weapons/vehicles some of which
         are over 40 years old. King said “we have 1916 Enfield rifles, 1947 tanks, 1941
         transportation equipment, no army can long survive unless it is periodically re-equipped,
         in Jordan case this long overdue.”</item>

      <p>At this point he spoke in Arabic to Rifai who said King had asked him to explain how in

      <p>In reply I said my Government’s response Jordan’s multiple request only transmitted two
       days ago at which time it was noted question additional units Jordan army under urgent
       consideration to be matter later communication. My opinion it only reasonable suppose due
       nature/size problem answers not likely be forthcoming several days probably longer. However I
       invited Hussein/RIFAI attention certain facts which must be taken into consideration: <list>
        <label>(A)</label>
        <item>If fully implemented <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> request would result more
         than 30 percent increase its armed forces. This carried serious political implications re

        <label>(B)</label>
        <item>Cost additional brigades approximately $25 million with re-equipment army neighborhood
         $60 million with comparable increase annual recurring costs which in turn would greatly
         increase army budget now approaching $50 million annually.</item>
        <label>(C)</label>
        <item>Recruitment, equipping, training new brigades would take one to two years far too long
         be of use in present emergency. I expressed thought would like think USG delay specific
         reply Jordan’s request might in light foregoing be considered result number very serious
         problems it entailed.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>King responded by saying he willing forego bringing army troop strength to <gloss
        target="#t_TO1">TO</gloss> level.</p>
      <p>However insisted two modern equipped brigades minimum requirement in external/internal
       security when <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops withdrawn. Said due fact many

      </list>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> called in Lord Hood to inform him that
       the Department had been giving consideration to the question of the withdrawal of certain
       U.S. troops from Lebanon. He said he knew the British would be interested in being informed
       of all developments of this nature because of the relationship to the question of British
       withdrawal from Jordan and Prime Minister Rifai’s attitude thereto (reported in Amman’s
       telegram 749)<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2"><ref target="#d309"><hi rend="italic"
         >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> with the presence of U.S. forces in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said the U.S. would withdraw one
       battalion of Marines about September 15, hoping it would be a salutary development in advance
       of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s inauguration. Another battalion, he said,
       will be withdrawn soon after the inauguration if political circumstances permit. Granted
       favorable conditions, the withdrawal of the sole remaining battalion and support troops might
       be completed, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> stated, before the end of
       October. No firm decisions had been made, however, except for the September 15 withdrawal of
       one battalion.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">At the Secretary’s Staff Meeting on September 5,
         <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the President was interested and
        hopeful that there would be a further reduction of U.S. forces in Lebanon. <persName
         corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> noted the tentative plan calling for the withdrawal
        of one battalion on September 15, a second on September 30, and the balance of the forces on
        October 15. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
         >Rountree</persName> agreed that it would be necessary to consult with the British on the
        overall plan, especially as Jordan represented the main potential stumbling block, but they
        also agreed that the British should be informed rather than consulted on the first
        reduction. (Department of State, Secretary’s Staff Meetings: Lot 63 D 75)</note></p>
      <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0582"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> informed Lord Hood in confidence of
       Prime Minister Rifai’s statement to Chargé d’Affaires Wright in Amman that he had informed
       the Secretary General he would be willing to see the British leave Jordan by September 30
       provided <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> agrees to abide by the General
       Assembly resolution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that this
       eventually seemed to hinge in part on the U.S.–U.K. decision re the financing of two
       additional Jordan army brigades. Lord Hood indicated a preference for an elementary level of
       equipment rather than the ambitious plans Rifai seemed to have in mind. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> remarked that the expense would be considerable in any
       case and we did not know how it could be met.</p>
      <p>The Hawker–Hunters scheduled for delivery to Jordan by the U.K. were discussed briefly,
       Lord Hood stating that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> has no particular views but is
       prepared to move in any manner the U.S. thinks desirable. In any case, it would be a long
       time before the planes got off the ground.</p>
      <p>Lord Hood expressed pleasure at the suggestion that the Jordanians have a definite date in
       mind for the departure of British troops, saying he thought this news would be a relief to
       his government. The British have had the impression, he said, that Jordan wanted them to
       remain indefinitely. On the other hand, it would be embarassing to depart prematurely only to
       find it necessary to return. He said he would be interested in knowing on what basis the
       Secretary General had suggested September 30. He hoped the U.S. and U.K. would remain in
       close touch on the issue.</p>

        withdrawal would be important to <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> in his

        leave Lebanon for the foreseeable future. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>
        strongly recommended that such a withdrawal be authorized, and that the announcement of the

       <item>General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> confirmed reports which had
        reached me of concentric plots both in and out of army designed primarily to frustrate his
        administration and secondarily to prepare way for an eventual federation of Lebanon with
         <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> strongly
        inferred but did not directly say that there were certain intransigent elements in loyalist
        circles who were lending themselves to these conspiracies (although how such partisans would
        wish to federate Lebanon with Syria he did not explain).</item>
       <label>(2)</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he had taken necessary preventative
        measures to forestall coup d’etat and had his eye on “three officers” who were involved in
        plot. He also said, somewhat to my unease, that his <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–2 was in
        direct contact with Syrian <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–2 with apparently a very free
        exchange of information. I plan to follow up on this item [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
         line of source text not declassified</hi>].</item>
       <label>(3)</label>
       <item><p>General said he had undertaken conversations with a view to forming a government
         immediately upon his assumption of power. At first he had favored naming Haj Hussein Oueini
         a moderate opposition leader as Prime Minister, but later Oueini himself led a delegation
         suggesting that Rashid Karame should receive this nomination on grounds that Tripoli was a
         critical area and this post had better be <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0584"/>given to
         a Tripolitanian Moslem leader. It later developed, however, that Christian loyalists and in
         particular entourage of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> were working
         violently against a government which would contain members of opposition. According to
          <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> plan of more fanatic loyalists is to insist
         on a so-called “neutral” government which will be incapable of doing its job. Ultimate
         purpose according to General would be prolongation of crisis in Lebanon with goal of
         creating such a continuing state of insecurity that US forces could not be withdrawn.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This hypothesis coincides with statements <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> made to me last week and again this morning that he
         thought US military presence should remain indefinitely in Lebanon.</p></item>
       <label>(4)</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said it would be difficult to see clearly
        with regard to a phased withdrawal of all US forces until he had taken office and nature of
        his new government was known. However, as reported separately, he feels a very urgent
        political necessity of having at least one Marine battalion commence its withdrawal toward
        middle September.</item>
       <label>(5)</label>
       <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> that I had informal indications
        that Hammarskjold would be here on September 10 and that Galo Plaza was preparing a
        suggested agenda for talks between General and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. We
        agreed that early next week, especially if Department and <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
         >DOD</gloss> concur in our recommendations re withdrawal of a Marine battalion, I might see
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> before his talks with Hammarskjold.</item>
       <label>(6)</label>
       <item>Re economic situation General was increasingly optimistic. He said his Chief of Staff
        had met today with syndicate of truckers to work out arrangements for greater security of
        vital highway commercial route to Damascus; and he had taken steps to remove certain
        interference from <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> (aided by Lebanese Sûreté) at
        checkpoint at <persName>Zahile</persName>. Queried as to chances of reopening standard gauge
        railroad from Beirut through Tripoli to Horns and Damascus, General said one bridge was
        blown up north of Tripoli but he was supplying security forces to protect workmen who he
        hoped would presently reopen line by rebuilding bridge. General said secretly he was
        tomorrow sending an emissary to Cairo to negotiate for resumption of important apple trade
        with Egypt. In gradual reopening of Basta and restoration of commercial life in Beirut
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought worst was over so far as Lebanese
        economy was concerned.</item>
       <label>(7)</label>
       <item>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and I asked General his views
        on collection of arms with which Lebanon is saturated. He said he would propose increasing
        penalties for holding unlicensed weapons and hoped to institute a system of arms purchase at
        fairly moderate prices. Here, however, money was the rub. He felt it might take up to 3
        million pounds for an effective program to be made complete. He likewise intended to demand
        of rebels immediate handing over from day of his inauguration all heavy weapons such as
        bazookas and thought they <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0585"/>would comply with this
        request. Collection of arms from both sides loyalist and opposition would be done on a
        phased basis so that neither faction would have an advantage.</item>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I believe it would be sound investment in our own security
       to say nothing of that of Lebanon if Department and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> would

      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said he very much hoped US military presence
       could remain in Lebanon “for the time being” as he still feared intervention from <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, had utterly no faith in any assurances given by <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, and thought Hammarskjold’s activities would be
       ineffective. Later <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> revealed he and President
       had lengthy discussion yesterday on what they should tell Hammarskjold re ultimate withdrawal
       of US forces. <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> at that time had insisted he
       thought our troops should not leave Lebanon before December. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> said he had told President that, according to his own reading of security
       situation and measures he would adopt to deal with it, there should be a general cleaning up
       of lawless elements including a nation-wide rendition of illegal arms which he thought he
       would have sufficient strength to accomplish within first week after his assumption of power.
       If things went as he expected, General thought it would be possible for US forces to commence
       withdrawal after end of this month. However, he had no preconceived ideas as to timing and
       preferred to be guided by facts as they developed. General said he had made it clear to
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> that whatever new government comes into office
       after September 24 would at least in principle insist on withdrawal of US forces.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was more optimistic on the present security
       situation than at any time since May 8th. He told us of return to normal conditions in the
       Basta, of fraternization in the suburbs of Beirut between Moslem and Christian merchants, and
       of a general improvement country-wide <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0589"/>in opening up
       areas hitherto held by rebels. Road is open north of Tripoli to Syrian frontier; and his
       patrols are now moving freely throughout <persName>Thebekaa</persName> to northern border.
       Yesterday a deputation of tribal leaders from <persName>Thebekaa</persName> came to see him
       and swear fidelity. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> made special point of
       saying he hoped our dependents would return here with appropriate favorable publicity as

           >McClintock</persName> indicated that Hammarskjöld’s arrival in Lebanon that evening came
          at an unpropitious moment as the outgoing government was bitter against Hammarskjöld
          personally and UNOGIL generally. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 320.5783A/9–958)</note>
         reception of Hammarskjold by <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> got off to a very poor
         start. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> was met at airfield by a relatively junior
         Foreign Office official in contrast to his reception at other Arab capitals. A 2-hour
         session yesterday with Mokhaiber was exceedingly painful and gave impression to
         Hammarskjold and his advisers that Lebanese Government was going out of its way to be
         difficult. Mokhaiber revealed his ignorance on almost every point of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
          >UN</gloss> procedure and probably caused a smile when he asked <persName

        <item>Although Mokhaiber made no effort to arrange an interview with <persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, at the last minute yesterday afternoon Hammarskjold
         was informed President would receive him. Although visit started on a note of chill
         formality, ice was broken when Hammarskjold began to speak in French and at end of a
         conversation lasting more than an hour <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and <persName

          >Chamoun</persName> was not only cordial but was sincere in what he was saying. Gist of
          <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s views was that US forces should not be
         withdrawn until danger to Lebanon’s independence had been removed and that in interim after
         withdrawal there should be some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in
         Lebanon.</item>

        <item><p>Hammarskjold and <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> were very favorably
          impressed by their talk with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> last night.
          General explained his desire for <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss> to continue
          after departure of American troops in order to allay fears of Christian population that
          they might be subject to Moslem reprisal. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
          gave Hammarskjold same time table re withdrawal as he has previously discussed with

           >Chehab</persName> this morning confirmed to me that he has asked Hammarskjold to build
          up <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss> in numbers before US withdrawals commence;
          but that if it were difficult to bring in additional observers quickly he would be

          as at present unarmed. Hammarskjold will also find no difficulty in maintaining <gloss
           target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss> indefinitely in Lebanon but would for planning
          purposes like to estimate on a target date for terminating their task. In response to
           <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>’s question I expressed personal view that
          for planning purposes January 1, 1959 might be a possible target date.</p></item>

         deliberately open. Purpose would be to have some representative of <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss> who could watch for possible threats to Jordanian integrity but not be
         regarded at same time as an indicator of internal weakness in Jordanian Government.</item>

          but I told <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> I was certain General <persName

         extremely difficult to deal with. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> said
         Hammarskjold had now come to agree with his (<persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
         >Bunche</persName>’s) analysis that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will some
         day “explode” in some nervous paroxysm because he is an inadequate man who realizes his own
         inadequacies and is trying desperately to prove he is wrong in that analysis.</item>
        <label>7)</label>
        <item>I asked if Hammarskjold had made any progress with Arab leaders in developing other
         aspects of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution. He said <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
          >SYG</gloss> had not sought to stress them unduly as he was trying to make progress on one
         or two finite points in order to show some advance in his September 30 report to the <gloss

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Situation in Lebanon and Jordan</hi></p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said that he had housekeeping and
       administrative problems to bring up concerning the army troops now in Lebanon. Present plans
       are to bring the remaining marine battalion out in the near future. This will leave the army
       battle group of approximately 7, 000. This force must be winterized if it is to stay after
       mid-fall, and it is due for rotation to the United States shortly after the turn of the year
       which would require the sending in of a new unit if its presence is still required. General
        <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> has noted <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s comments that the United States would be needed at least until the end
       of the year, whereas he had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
       was more optimistic about an earlier withdrawal date.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> gave as his entirely personal view the
       opinion that if political conditions continue to improve in Lebanon all but a token force
       could be removed by the end of October. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
       inquired <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0596"/>as to the nature and size of a token force.
       Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> said that the big problem is the
       connection between our forces and the British forces in Jordan. We have made clear to the
       British that we will not leave their forces in Jordan alone in the Middle East. The political
       problem in Jordan is more difficult and withdrawal might not be possible as early as in
       Lebanon. For this reason a token force in Lebanon might be required even though the Lebanese
       situation per se might not require it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>
       added in response to General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>’s further
       questioning that, again in his personal opinion only, the token force would not be one
       possessing a military capability but would represent more a political presence on the part of
       the United States.</p>
      <p>He said that he did not believe that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> would
       place us in an awkward position by insisting on immediate total withdrawal, although he
       believed we would acceed to a firm request on <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
       part. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> asked about Hammarskjold’s
       activities in the Middle East. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> responded
       that Hammarskjold appears to be taking no position recommending withdrawal of U.S. and
       British forces. The proposed United Nations presence in the Middle East, in Mr.
        <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>’s view, would not in itself contribute sufficient
       assurance to justify Western military withdrawal. Hammarskjold has been successful in
       securing agreement on United Nations representation in Amman, Damascus and Beirut to report
       on violations of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agreement and on evidence of attempt
       at “indirect aggression”. This would not be a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer
       force in the usual sense, however.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that the army forces
       remaining in Lebanon after October 1 will be reduced from 7, 000 to 6, 500. This would leave
       a balanced force but one of the minimum size with a military significance. Anything smaller
       would be a “flying the flag” gesture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>
       asked whether plans were firm for departure of the Marine Battalion remaining after the
       current battalion withdrawal. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>
       responded that this was as yet only for planning purposes, and that the planning date was
       scheduled for shortly after October 1. There was discussion between Messrs. Reinhardt and
       Rockwell and General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> on the fluidity of the
       situation immediately after <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> takes office on
       September 24. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> will take time to form his
       government and convince the opposition nothing is to be gained by further violence or use of
       armed force. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> will have to get physical control
       of much of the country. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> feels that
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is already doing well to consolidate his
       position. The army is now going into rebel held areas and assuming control with considerable
       firmness.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> summed up this agenda item by saying
       that he assumed from the discussion that U.S. forces would be out of Lebanon, or virtually
       so, by the end of October but that it was recognized <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0597"
       />that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s desires would have strong bearing on
       the matter. He said that from his point of view he would like to remove the troops as soon as
       the military situation no longer requires their presence.<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">The
         <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> informed Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1"

      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Aid to Jordan</hi></p>
      <p>There was a brief discussion on aid to Jordan in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
        >Sprague</persName> participated. He summarized the State–Defense agreed position to turn
       down Hussein’s request for equipment and support for two additional brigades. He and Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> pointed out that the political situation did
       not allow a flat turn-down of the request at this time and that we were therefore taking
       advantage of an offer by the King to send a small U.S. mission to Jordan to study the
       military situation. It was agreed that an army officer and an <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
        >ICA</gloss> officer would compose this team. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
        >Sprague</persName> quoted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> as
       considering this a holding operation which might use up six weeks time to allow the political
       situation in Jordan further to crystallize, allowing a reconsideration of the U.S. policy in
       the area at that time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> pointed out in
       response to a question from General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> that the
       U.S. survey mission would also have a constructive role to play in making positive
       recommendations for the reequipping and strengthening of the presently constituted armed
       forces of Jordan. The findings of the mission could also provide additional bases for turning
       down the request for establishment of the two new brigades.</p>

       remain. As matter of fact we have since beginning believed it likely situation justifying
       withdrawal US forces would develop much faster in Lebanon than one facilitating removal
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops from Jordan, and one of our concerns has been that
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> not be left exposed in Jordan after US has left Lebanon.
       End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
      <p>You should thank Rifai for his considerate concern re possible implications for US in
       Lebanon of withdrawal <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces from Jordan. We would not wish
       this factor to be reason for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops to remain in Jordan any
       longer than <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> deems it to be in best interests Jordan for
       them to be there. As matter fact there has been substantial improvement security situation
       Lebanon and as result one US Marine battalion has already been withdrawn and another is now
       leaving both by agreement with Lebanese authorities. If security situation continues improve
       we hope further withdrawals can be made in reasonably near future.</p>

      <p>Since within a week or 10 days it seems inevitable we shall be asked to leave Department
       will no doubt wish to consider possibility of some statement on our part which might lessen
       threat of vicious propaganda attacks upon us by Cairo–Baghdad–Damascus radios and Communist
       propaganda machine elsewhere. Such attacks might portray US withdrawal from Lebanon as
       “retreat of imperialists” or evacuation forced by triumphant anti-US public opinion.</p>
      <p>As seen from here a statement on our part that the security situation in Lebanon has so
       improved as to make possible our voluntary withdrawal of US forces would go far to obviate
       these contingencies. It might be possible in Secretary’s forthcoming speech at opening

      <p>The Secretary General commented that he expected this session of the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
        >GA</gloss> to be an important one. Although there were not many important items on the
       agenda, they would offer a springboard for the Assembly to consider a good many important
       problems.</p>
      <p>[Here follows discussion of the Sino-Soviet bloc]</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> reported in some detail on his trip to the Middle
       East. His report compares with that contained in <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 362
       which reported on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJW2">Barco</persName>’s conversation of
       September 14. The following points may be added: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Prime Minister Rifai of Jordan told the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> in utter
         confidence that if it were not for the King’s emotional reactions, he thought it would be
         possible to establish relationships and work with the regime in Iraq. Because of the King’s
         reactions, however, he did not believe the time was propitious for such a move.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>With respect to Lebanon, the Secretary General commented that he had developed a high
         regard for <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> whom he believed to be a deeply
         patriotic man. He got the impression that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, as
         a military man, was fed up with politicians, and he doubted <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>’s capacity to deal with complex situations. On the whole, however, his
         impression of <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was very good.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>Hammarskjold did not cover the question of withdrawal of US or <gloss target="#t_UK1"
          >UK</gloss> forces in his report. He said he wanted to see what developments take place
         after <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s inauguration.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>With respect to the resumption of Jordanian-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
         relations, he said that both countries seemed favorably disposed in principle. <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> pointed out that Jordan broke relations and it was up
         to Jordan to resume them. Hammarskjold said that he had given some thought to <pb n="569"
          xml:id="pg_569" facs="0601"/>the possibility of Husseini’s (Arab League) acting as a
         middle man in this respect, but he had the impression Husseini did not carry much weight.
         In any event, the Arabs, thorough their own organization, ought to try to bring about a
         resumption of relations.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> assured Hammarskjold that air and land
         traffic with Jordan would be resumed soon. It was merely a question of timing. He probably
         would wait until <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> took over in Lebanon in
         order to tie in the resumption of traffic with the general improvement in Arab
         relationships.</item>
        <label>(6)</label>
        <item>In general, Hammarskjold’s attitude was one of guarded optimism. His description of
         the general situation was not unduly pessimistic. He seemed to feel that with good luck and
         careful handling an explosion in the Middle East might be avoided.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>In conclusion Hammarskjold said he thought it would be sufficient if the <gloss
        target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> would merely note the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s
       report on the Middle East and not take any further action.</p>

      <p>1585. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> has received a telegram
       from <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss><note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">Not found.</note>
       indicating that on September 12 there was a meeting between State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
        >DOD</gloss> at which it was agreed that because of desirability of there being some US
       forces in Lebanon pending withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops from Jordan
       it might be useful to leave a token US force here for some time after withdrawal of main body
       American troops.</p>
      <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> with my concurrence, has informed
        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> he would like to leave a very small training mission of
       some 11 officers and 60 enlisted men and hoped to use this as cover for a larger token force
       consisting of 2 infantry companies with specialist platoons of artillery, tanks, transport,
       signals and engineers.</p>
      <p>In expressing my concurrence with over-all project, I made it clear to <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> I have considerable misgiving as to ease with which
       we might be able to negotiate either a small training mission or a token force to remain
       after main body has been withdrawn. On training <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"
       />mission I am perhaps more aware than our own military of extreme sensitivity of Lebanese
       senior officers to any imputation they may not be up to modern standards, as well as of
       French imbued feeling that predominantly French methods used by Lebanese Army cannot be
       improved upon. On problem of leaving a token force we have public declarations of <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and of such opposition leaders as Karame, <persName>Saeb
        Salaam</persName> and others indicating unanimous demand for withdrawal of all US forces.
       With <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s request to Hammarskjold for a large
       augmentation <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss> being answered affirmatively, it will
       be all the more difficult to secure <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s and his
       new Government’s acquiescence to retention of a US “presence”.</p>
      <p>In view of these considerations, would appreciate Departmental guidance on these two issues
       of a training mission and a token force since from <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>

        conditions continued to improve in Lebanon, U.S. forces could be withdrawn by the end of
        October. If such a withdrawal had an adverse political impact on the British position in
        Jordan, however, it was suggested that it might be desirable to maintain a token U.S.
        military presence in Lebanon pending the British withdrawal from Jordan. Beyond the desire
        to be helpful to the British, there was neither need nor desire to maintain a token force in
        Lebanon, and the Department was considering the possibility of withdrawing all U.S. forces
        from Lebanon by October 15. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/9–1758; included in

       from Lebanon without Defense having any assurance that internal stability is being protected
       by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said Defense believed that to pull our troops
       out and then have things blow up again would be worse than delaying the withdrawal. We would
       not appear to be very smart if we get out by October 15 and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

       could see the desirability of announcing our withdrawal as soon as possible since, as Mr.

      <p>970. In view distinct possibility King Hussein under pressure political/military/tribal

       Arab Nationalism, Embassy opinion some thought should be given possible courses action to be

        <persName corresp="#p_alMHP1">Hazza Majali</persName> now engaged power struggle with Rifai
       using his palace position as lever or from opposition leaders themselves. In any case all
       will be anxious ascertain probable USG attitude new government particularly with respect
       continuation/expansion our military/economic aid programs.</p>
      <p>Country Team has repeatedly indicated any success of Rifai administration must move “left”.
       At moment only visible candidate would be collection “retreat politicians” having varying
       degrees leftist <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0609"/>tendencies, none of whom have
       capacity satisfy inherent public desire broader base representative government or delay
       natural swing toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as only true symbol Arab
       Nationalism.</p>
      <p>Real danger lies not in “devil we know but rather devil we don’t know”. Major task
       confronting mission Amman is to discover who is potential leader able bring fresh approach
       present routine cabinet reshuffles, equally important is to know his source of power and
       ideas for Jordan foreign policy. Under present circumstances wherein martial law has been in
       force a year and half new leader must either come from army or have substantial military
       support including tribal allegiances. Jordan cannot for long continue “imperialist island in
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> sea,” must eventually work out accommodation
       its Arab neighbors all of which at moment are hostile in some degree. This process will
       require adjustment Jordan foreign policy which for last 18 months has not only been pro-West
       but more specifically pro-US especially under Rifai.</p>
      <p>It would seem advisable USG should have definite policy re our relation any future <gloss

       succeed Rifai to extreme pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> Nationalist.</p>
      <p>If USG decision is “business as usual policy” regardless political coloration new Jordanian

       establishment government extreme nationalist type either through coup d’etat or less violent
       means without any apparent foreign intervention.</p>

        report<note n="3" xml:id="d330fn3">Apparently a preliminary draft of the report submitted by

       should <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> fail to abide by August 21 <gloss target="#t_GA1"
        >GA</gloss> resolution.<note n="4" xml:id="d330fn4">See <ref target="#d287">Document
         287</ref>.</note> Accordingly United Kingdom has prepared statement in consultation with
       Abdul Monem Rifai in New York and cleared with Hammarskjold to effect that United Kingdom and
       Jordan are agreed that British troops in Jordan should start withdrawal in October and
       contemplate that withdrawal will be completed in October provided situation permits.
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> hopes to issue statement before leaving
       New York September 26. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> has
       insisted that statement be worded so as not to bind United Kingdom to fixed dates.</p>
      <p><gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would like to issue second statement before October 10
       giving date for start of withdrawal of troops. October 10 date is related to Conservative
       Party conference in advance of which <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> wishes to have
       announced date for withdrawal.</p>
      <p>Regarding actual withdrawal Chiefs of Staff insist that because of small number of men
       involved, operation once started must be carried to completion. Present intention is to move
       Cameronians and heavy equipment out through Aqaba with Cameronians going to Aden. Para-troop
       units with light equipment would be moved out by air. Entire operations to take 14 to 17 days
       once necessary shipping assembled.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> has spoken to Hammarskjold regarding
       overflights of Syria for withdrawal purposes. Hammarskjold said matter would have to be
       negotiated out with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, but he foresaw no difficulties.</p>
      <p>British Ambassador Amman has warned that early withdrawal of British troops involves grave
       risk of coup in Jordan. Ambassador particularly apprehensive of action by non-Beduin section
       of Arab army <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0611"/>led by Deputy <gloss target="#t_COS1"
        >COS</gloss>
       <persName>Sadiq Ash-Shara</persName>. For this reason Ambassador still pressing his
       recommendation that United States and United Kingdom, before withdrawal of British troops,
       agree to King Hussein’s request for additional Beduin units in order to give clear
       preponderance within army to Beduin elements. Ambassador has advised that plans for possible
       evacuation of British community be placed in readiness. Foreign Office, without endorsing
       Ambassador views, asked that they be brought to Department’s attention.</p>
      <p>Hadow added Foreign Office believes there are four ways in which <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> can demonstrate insofar as Jordan concerned that it will respect call for good
       neighborliness contained in August 21 resolution: Permit free movement of goods between
       Jordan and Beirut, permit free movement of Jordan subjects between Jordan and Beirut, cease
       hostile propaganda broadcasts and cease efforts at subversion. <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> should be able to establish easily facts with respect of first two points and
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should remove restrictions before withdrawal of British
       troops. Last two points will always be open to controversy and differences of

          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and to Lebanese opposition elements. There were also
         several prominent opposition leaders in the new cabinet and the Christian leadership had
         been almost eclipsed by the Moslem. It was significant that the make-up of the new cabinet
         had been accurately predicted in Damascus before its composition was actually announced in
         Lebanon.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile the security situation in Lebanon has gravely deteriorated. If violence
         continues, as is likely, the ability of the security forces to maintain order will be
         seriously weakened. Indeed, the security forces themselves may come to be divided along
         religious lines.</p>
        <p>“In Jordan King Hussein is considering the replacement of his unpopular Prime Minister,
         Rifai, as well as other unpopular ministers in the present cabinet. These moves may portend
         a more neutralist <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0612"/>Jordan in the future. The
         effectiveness of the so-called <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence was very

      <p>Following is a summary of the Middle East portion of the Secretary’s talk with Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>:</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> urged that
       the United States not exclude the possibility of providing assistance to Jordan in order to
       enable the King to create some additional military force based upon the use of the more
       reliable Bedouin tribes. He feared that unless the military situation were improved, Jordan
       would collapse shortly after the British withdrawal. While he realized that we could not
       provide everything the King wanted, he earnestly hoped that we could do something that would
       strengthen the King’s hand in the military field.</p>
      <p>At the Secretary’s request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> outlined
       our views regarding the Jordanian request for two additional brigades. He said the expense of
       this military force was considerably greater than we could meet through additional military
       and budgetary aid. We had some doubts as to the feasibility, quite apart from the question of
       funds. We had not, however, told the King that we would not provide for any additional
       forces. We were sending a mission which would look into the military situation and report
       back to Washington, after which decisions would be made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
        >Lloyd</persName> urged that the mission not communicate <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581"
        facs="0613"/>to the Jordanian Government in Amman that additional military forces would not
       be approved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said it was our intention
       that the mission would be instructed not to communicate any such decisions directly to
       Jordan.</p>

      <p>1703. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and I called this afternoon
       on President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and made an extensive tour
       d’horizon with following results.</p>
      <list>
       <label>(1)</label>
       <item><p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said recent disturbances in Beirut
         ostensibly inspired by Phalange following abduction of <persName corresp="#p_HF3"
          >Haddad</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d333fn2">On September 19, <persName corresp="#p_HF3"
           >Fuad Haddad</persName>, an editorial writer with the Phalange newspaper <hi
           rend="italic">Al Amal</hi> was kidnapped and subsequently murdered. (Telegram 1648 from
          Beirut, September 21; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/9–2158) The kidnapping
          increased tensions between contending factions in Beirut, but the Embassy reported on
          September 23 that tensions abated following the arrest of men believed guilty of the
          kidnapping and murder. (Telegram 1670 from Beirut; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>
          783A.00/9–2358)</note> had served to confirm his suspicions that there was an important
         political element in Lebanon which sought deliberately to continue state of conflict and in
         particular to destroy Lebanese army. Although <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
         did not say so straight out, it was clear he suspected <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> hoped by maintaining continuing turmoil to find an opportunity once
         more to step back into power.</p>
        <p>Thus, said <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, it had become clear in recent
         days that Phalange itself had been infiltrated with more extremist elements who took their
         orders from Moghabghab Chamoun’s henchman and hatchetman. President said <persName
          corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> had been much more moderate and had sought in fact to
         restrain his more fanatic followers. (We have independent confirmation of this fact from
         other sources.)</p></item>
       <label>(2)</label>
       <item><p>Despite these maneuverings President felt confident of his ability promptly to
         restore order in Beirut. He realized that now Christian fanatics had violated law and
         disturbed the peace he was in a position impartially to strike at any malefactors whether
         Moslem or Christian and this he intended to do.</p>
        <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0614"/>
        <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said that although new government which had
         its first meeting with him today had proposed final clean-up measures be deferred in
         deference to Prophet’s birthday tomorrow he, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>,
         had given orders for security forces to proceed forthwith in removing barricades throughout
         Beirut including the Basta. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> predicted that by
         Saturday or at latest Sunday all of Beirut would be open and order restored. He has been
         much helped in this by fact Beirut Moslem leadership is cooperating with Karame; by
         restraining influence now being imposed on Phalange by <persName corresp="#p_GP4"
          >Gemayel</persName>; by salutary deployment of <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1"
          >CINCSPECOMME</gloss>’s forces; and by no nonsense application of military rule any
         unauthorized person found with arms will be shot. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> said once Beirut was open and order restored he would institute a
         period of grace for rendition of weapons without punishment to be followed later by more
         rigorous measures for collecting clandestine arms. With dispersion of present irregular
         forces however President was certain military would be in complete domination of situation
         everywhere.</p></item>

       <item>Asked re new Karame Cabinet (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1700)<note n="3"
         xml:id="d333fn3">In telegram 1700 from Beirut, September 25, the Embassy provided an
         assessment of the Karame Cabinet, which was described as an “opposition-third force-neutral
         coalition whose ministers are either all anti-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
         or have not recently been pro-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.” (<hi
          rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.13/9–2558)</note> President said he had been faced with
        choice of trying to assemble a coalition of antagonistic leaders who would carry on civil
        war in Cabinet or trying to find a group of men representing all confessional sects who
        could work together in harmony. He had even tried to appoint ministers who would be pleasing
        to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>; but was now convinced <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> did not want harmony as he thought his own interests
        could be best furthered by continuance of discord. It was for a similar reason that
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had decided against creating a government
        made of parliamentarians or those deputies left out would refuse their support until other
        cabinets were formed permitting their participation. Every politician wanted his piece of
        cheese; and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s low opinion of “the fromagistes”
        had in no way altered.</item>
       <label>(4)</label>
       <item><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said Phalange and other card-carrying
        Christians were making dire statements of controlling sufficient votes to forestall a vote
        of confidence for Karame government when Parliament meets (he thought) next week. Although a
        vote of confidence is not constitutionally mandatory it is customary in Lebanese
        parliamentary practice. New Karame cabinet was assured of support of former opposition
        deputies and of middle bloc such as Raymond Edde’s national front. How <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> deputies would vote yet remained in doubt. However
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was determined to go straight ahead. If
        Parliament did not like government he had just appointed it could say so and he would
        dissolve this Parliament and call for new elections. General said if he <pb n="583"
         xml:id="pg_583" facs="0615"/>gave in on this point it would merely mean commencement of an
        unending parliamentary squabble as factions vied for temporary advantage. He implied that
        this would be part of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s over-all plan.
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he preferred to meet these issues
        straight on without fear or favor and to let the deputies draw their own conclusions. He
        seemed confident of popular support for such a line of conduct.</item>
       <label>(5)</label>
       <item>On withdrawal of US forces <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was categoric
        in saying he thought we should adhere to our phased plan of operations. He saw no objection
        to retraction of Third Marine BLT on or before September 30; and he thought all our forces
        could safely be removed by end of October. General volunteered suggestion an agreed
        communiqué of some sort would be useful. We said without any reference to <gloss

      <p>Following is a summary of the portion of the Secretary’s meeting with Foreign Minister
        <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> dealing with Jordan:</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> referred to a message which he had just
       received from the British Ambassador at Amman stating that King Hussein would like to
       announce in a speech from the throne October 1 his understanding with the British regarding
       the withdrawal of forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said that this
       would be a good occasion from the Jordanian viewpoint to announce withdrawal, but he thought
       the date would be too soon after publication of Secretary General Hammarskjold’s report. He
       had hoped that the Secretary General’s report indicating British intention regarding
       withdrawal could be published and that there could be provided several days thereafter to
       observe measures taken in implementation of the United Nations resolution. He was concerned
       that there should not be set into motion irrevocable steps for British withdrawal without
       some assurance that the situation in Jordan would be changed for the better.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> mentioned that we had something of the
       same problem with respect to Lebanon. We felt it necessary to announce our intention to
       withdraw by the end of October. However, we were including in our statement that the
       withdrawal would be completed by October 31, barring unforeseen developments. Perhaps the
       British problem could be met if King Hussein should make it clear that his arrangements with
       the British envisaged withdrawal of British forces by the end of October, barring unforeseen
       developments.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> seemed to favor such an approach. It
       should be made clear that the withdrawal plans were predicated on the assumption that the
       Secretary General’s plans would be carried out.</p>

        reiterated his preference that it be a unilateral U.S. communiqué indicating close and
        cordial consultation with the Lebanese Government. He suggested that <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> work out the final wording with Foreign Minister
         <persName>Takla</persName>. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/9–2658; included

       and said he was in complete agreement that it should be released to Secretary General and
       that he very much appreciated our courtesy in giving Lebanese Government a chance to comment.
       Re proposed communiqué suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1365, he said he
       wished to bring Prime Minister up to date on entire question of troop withdrawal and that he
       would wish to discuss this matter with me early next week. I indicated <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has expressed his preference for a unilateral communiqué
       coming from US.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister expressed great personal gratification that our relationship had been so
       cordial and so close that he could venture to count on my help in difficult days ahead. I
       said I was equally happy to work with Philippe Bey as an old friend and that, as he knew, we
       had very consistently indicated our desire to help Lebanon retain its integrity and
       independence.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister asked specifically if I could use my influence, particularly in the
       Christian community, in bringing people to a more moderate attitude of mind. He said
       regrettably <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was maneuvering to bring about a
       state of disorder where he might once more dream of returning to presidential power. Other
       Christian political factions, particularly the Phalange and <gloss target="#t_PPS1"
        >PPS</gloss>, merely looked upon forthcoming parliamentary maneuvering as a means of getting
       once more “at the Cheese.” Where they were mistaken, said <persName>Takla</persName>, was in
       their belief there was still some cheese to nibble at. New government, he said, could at
       least point to personal probity of its Ministers. He cited by way of example a two-hour
       conversation he had with Phalange leaders yesterday afternoon which, after much palaver on
       principles and high-sounding aims, boiled down to fact they wanted one portfolio for their
       own party.</p>
      <p>In a later call with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> on Prime
       Minister Karame in his capacity as President of Council and also Minister of Defense, Admiral
        <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and I told press we had come to pay our
       respects as US diplomatic and military representatives in Lebanon and that we wished to
       assure new Prime Minister of US desire to do everything possible to help Lebanon restore
       unity and peace as necessary conditions to primary objective of maintaining independence and
       integrity of the Republic.</p>
      <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0619"/>
      <p>Karame said he would like to repeat what he had told <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
        >Murphy</persName>; namely, that he and his followers had never deviated from a firm
       friendship for the US. He hoped he could look for our assistance in helping him to achieve
       his policy of pacification, unification and preservation of the independence of Lebanon.
       Prime Minister was pleased when we indicated degree to which we and President <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> were already in cordial agreement on proposed phased
       withdrawal of US Forces.</p>
      <p>At request of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister I plan informally to have conversations
       with various political and religious leaders, indicating our hope that Lebanon will achieve a
       breathing spell and will be able to get rapidly back on the path toward unity and
       independence.</p>

      <p>On September 29, <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Secretary-General Hammarskjöld
       submitted his report to the General Assembly on the implementation of the resolution adopted
       by the Assembly on August 21. The report detailed Hammarskjöld’s efforts to forge agreement
       among Middle Eastern leaders on conditions necessary to underwrite peace and stability in the
       area. He reported on agreement reached with the Government of Jordan to station a personal
       representative of the Secretary-General in Jordan to report on implementation of the August
       21 resolution, and noted that Lebanon and the United Arab Republic had offered facilities to
       guarantee lines of communication to the representative to be established in Amman.</p>
      <p>In Lebanon, agreement was reached on the expansion of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >U.N.</gloss> Observation Group to facilitate the withdrawal of the U.S. forces in that
       country. The continuing role of the Observation Group would depend upon the rate of progress
       toward the return of stability in Lebanon. The report concluded that, in light of improved
       conditions in Lebanon and Jordan, the United States and the United Kingdom had indicated that
       negotiations were underway with the host governments looking toward the complete withdrawal
       of their forces from Lebanon and Jordan, if conditions continued favorable, by the end of

      <p>1757. Since political situation has shown little sign of improvement in recent days I have
       decided to move more energetically in taking up <persName corresp="#p_GP4"
       >Gemayel</persName>’s request for my good offices reported Embassy telegram 1724.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d338fn2">In telegram 1724 from Beirut, September 28, McClintock reported on a
        conversation with Phalange Chief Pierre <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> in
        which <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> requested <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName>’s good offices in negotiating with the <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> government to end the general strike which the Phalange had called.
         <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> stated that he was prepared to negotiate on
        the basis of two principles: that the kidnappers or murderers of <persName corresp="#p_HF3"
         >Haddad</persName> be swiftly sought out and brought to justice, and that a political
        solution be developed based on “peace without victory.” <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName> agreed to try to help find a solution to the dispute. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/9–2858; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> I
       have asked Prime Minister Karame, Foreign Minister <persName>Takla</persName>, <persName
        corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> and two of his Henchmen, Kamal Jumblat, Henri Pharaon,
       Maurice Zwein, <persName corresp="#p_EP2">Pierre Edde</persName>, <persName>Takieddine
        Solh</persName>, Ghassan Tweini, Joseph Skaff and Adel Osseiran to meet at my house at six
       this evening to see if some formula cannot be found which will end general strike in Beirut
       and, in effect, terminate this civil war.</p>
      <p>Formula I propose to suggest has three main points: <list>
        <label>1)</label>
        <item>Vote of confidence for Karame Cabinet.</item>
        <label>2)</label>
        <item>Widening of Karame cabinet to grant 3 and possibly 4 portfolios to pro-<persName
          corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> Loyalists or Christian elements who now feel without
         representation in Government.</item>
        <label>3)</label>
        <item>Karame government and parliamentary deputies to agree on enlarging parliamentary
         representation from 66 to 88 seats.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Foregoing possible solution would satisfy practically everyone and at same time keep within
       strict constitutional bounds. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has already told
       me he is willing to broaden cabinet after vote of confidence; and he has indicated his
       personal preference for enlarging parliament to 88 seats. Moslem opposition, including
       Jumblat’s Druzes, should be pleased to have a chance to increase their representation in
       parliament while, at same time, so-called Loyalists should <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589"
        facs="0621"/>have an equal opportunity to contend for these new seats. Loyalists and
       Christians should be appeased if they are given what they regard as a fair representation in
       Karame government.</p>
      <p>I tried out this idea this morning when I visited Greek Orthodox Archbishop
        <persName>Saleeby</persName> who was on point this afternoon of announcing a call for
       Moslems and Christians to get together in conference in an effort to work out present
       impasse. <persName>Saleeby</persName> was so pleased with formula he said he would prefer to
       stay his own hand until outcome of tonight’s meeting at Embassy residence is clear. Other
       Christians with whom I have discussed foregoing outline likewise feel it is just and has a
       possibility of acceptance.</p>
      <p>Main criticism of my formula is that it is too equitable and logical. This of itself is
       almost a disqualification in present-day Lebanon. However, the Archbishop said he would pray
       for my success.</p>

       whole a success, although at last minute Prime Minister Karame dropped out because of
       pressure put on him by unreconstructed rebels <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>, Abdullah Yafi
       and Hussein Ouwini. Fact they exercised this pressure indicates importance they attached to
       formula for a political solution. All other leaders whose names were cited reference telegram
       were present at last night’s two-hour meeting with exception of Jumblat who had another
       engagement.</p>
      <p>I invited each member of the group to have his say and found general agreement on proposed
       formula, although <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> did not wish to commit
       himself definitively at this first meeting. From a variety of sources I am convinced he did
       not dare commit loyalist side without permission of <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>, who is mastermind behind the present Christian strike. However, on
       departure his cousin Maurice Gemayel, who is a far sounder and more intelligent member of the

         >Chehab</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> felt that the meeting
        had served a useful purpose as a catalyst for action among the Lebanese themselves.
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said that he was willing to grant two or
        three portfolios to Christian loyalists and was prepared to increase the number of seats in
        Parliament, but would only do so after the Karame government received a vote of confidence
        in Parliament. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> admitted that the Christian
        strike had effectively paralyzed business in Beirut, and was hopeful that negotiations would
        bring an end to it. To that end, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> welcomed the
        fact that <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> was scheduled to see <persName

      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on October 2 on significant world developments
       affecting U.S. security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered the
       following assessment of developments in Lebanon and Jordan which prompted discussion among
       Council members: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“With respect to the situation in Lebanon, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
          >Dulles</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, the new
         President of Lebanon, was proposing to call a special session of the Lebanese Parliament in
         order to seek a vote of confidence for the new cabinet headed by Prime Minister Karami.
         Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was threatening to dissolve the
         Lebanese Parliament if the vote of confidence was not forthcoming. While the Lebanese
         Parliament was strong in its support of former President <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> predicted that the
         vote of confidence in the Karami government would be forthcoming. Incidentally, he added,
         that all the seven cabinet <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0623"/>ministers nominated by
         Karami had been opposed to former President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
         pro-Western policy. Accordingly, the situation was very tense from the point of view of the
         Christian element in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it was not his own
         view or that of the State Department that the new Karami regime was in any sense
         anti-Western. Former President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had adopted an
         extreme pro-Western policy, so extreme, in fact, that he, Secretary <persName
          corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, had suggested at one time modifications in this
         policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> therefore believed that the
         creation of the new Karami regime constituted a reaction to the extreme pro-Western policy
         of former President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. While the new government
         was not really anti-American, Karami and his colleagues would want to blunt the sharp
         differences which had hitherto existed between the government of Lebanon and <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as well as other Arab Nationalist leaders.</p>
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that he could not agree
         wholly with the view expressed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.
         He thought that the new Lebanese government would pursue a foreign policy similar to that
         being pursued by the new government in Iraq. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
          >Dulles</persName> expressed his disagreement and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
          Dulles</persName> replied that he and the Secretary would have to agree to differ on this
         point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that, in general, the
         Moslem leaders in Lebanon were further away from the West than was President <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> himself.</p>
        <p>“In Jordan, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, rumours were
         spreading that King Hussein was planning to bring opposition leaders into the Jordanian
         cabinet. Hussein’s objective here would be to protect himself when the British forces left
         Jordan about October 20. Meanwhile, there had been no let-up in the vicious propaganda war
         against Hussein waged by Cairo and Damascus.</p>
        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that the
         continued blockade of Jordan by her Arab neighbors was at least as disturbing as the
         continued propaganda campaign. Hammarskjold’s whole plan for Jordan as well as the plans
         for the departure of British forces from the country actually depended on the lifting of
         this blockade. If it were not lifted, Jordan would be in a helpless condition.” (Memorandum
         of discussion at the 381st Meeting of the National Security Council, prepared by Gleason on
         October 3; Eisenhower Library, <persName>Whitman</persName> File, NSC Records)</p>

      <p>928. You should inform King we understand he desires our views as to what actions Jordan
       might ask <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to take in regard to continuing subversive
       activity by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in Jordan and also wishes to know what
       support Jordan might expect to receive from US in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should
       Jordan raise this matter there.</p>
      <p>You should inform Hussein that as we see it indirect aggression against Jordan through
       subversive activities from outside created a situation which led to appeal by <gloss

       ready response by both governments to this appeal and to discussion in Special <gloss
        target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> session of indirect aggression against Jordan and Lebanon.
       Outcome was adoption of resolution sponsored by Arab states designed to bring an end to
       subversive interference by one <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> state in another and request
       to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to set up arrangements whereby <gloss target="#t_UN1"

      <p>1805. As indicated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1791,<note n="2"
        xml:id="d342fn2">See <ref target="#d339fn3">footnote 3, Document 339</ref>.</note> I saw
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> this morning, taking a helicopter provided by
       General Adams to avoid numerous road blocks imposed now both by Phalange and Lebanese army.
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> is currently at the <persName>Villa</persName>
       of a rich industrialist in a village called Bois de Boulogne near Dhour Choueir.</p>
      <p>It took half an hour to move half a mile from where helicopter landed to <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s villa as road was blocked by 15 large buses and
       perhaps 75 private automobiles filled with cheering adherents of ex-President. A crowd of
       almost a thousand people filled garden outside villa equipped with two brass bands and a
       plethora of automatic weapons. When <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> appeared to
       greet me there was a deafening chant of “we will have no other President than <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>”; this refrain continued without interruption for the
       full hour of our interview, punctuated by numerous shots in the air. According to gendarme
       captain who met me, similar scenes have gone on almost continuously over past ten days. He
       estimated average daily visit of adherents to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       residence at around 5, 000.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was obviously excited and pleased at the
       adulation. How any man could think calmly amid such din or reach objective conclusions is a
       mystery to me. However, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> did make certain very
       emphatic points: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> still held to his word that he pledged
         full support <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as President of Lebanon. It was
         his pressure on Parliament which had resulted in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName>’s election and he was still ready to do everything within reason to
         make <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s regime a success.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Christian and to some extent a certain Moslem opinion had been outraged by <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s selection of new Karame government. Karame
         epitomized rebel from the barricades whom everyone knew had taken Syrian arms and money and
         who would follow a policy not only of going along with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> but of placing Moslems in places of preference in public
         administration. Other members of Cabinet such as Takla (“spineless”), Helou (“a Jesuit”)
         and Najjar (“a Druze chosen to please Jumblat”) could not under any stretch of imagination
         be regarded as representing half of Lebanon’s population. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> made a gesture toward the mob outside and said “this is proof of how
         they feel”.</item>
        <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0626"/>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had counseled <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> that in first six months at least of his
         administration he would be wise to appoint a neutral government whose composition could
         offend no one. He mentioned such names as Daouk, Moslem former Ambassador to Paris, as a
         possible Prime Minister, and such other neutral but respected figures as Alfred Naccache
         and Jawad Boulos.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Failing his first preference for a purely neutral transitional government which would
         serve to appease passions and make possible an eventual revision of electoral law to widen
         representation in Parliament prior to eventual new elections, <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
          >Chamoun</persName> would reluctantly consent to a Karame Cabinet but one made up of men
         who would give it a far more representative character. He said several times “I will not
         impose my veto on Karame, but I would far prefer my first choice of a neutral
         government”.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item><p>If <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought he could ram present
          Karame Cabinet down throats of Lebanese people [he] was mistaken.</p>
         <p>Christians were thoroughly up in arms; the Christian strike was a crippling one; and
          Parliament would most certainly refuse a vote of confidence for Karame’s Cabinet as now
          constituted. This might either lead to an attempt at dictatorship by <persName
           corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> or to elections which would be tantamount to civil
          war. In either case <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> was prepared to take
          personal leadership of militant Christians and descend to the plain to fight it out. His
          forces were less well armed than Moslems but he doubted if Lebanese army would be a surer
          instrument in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s hands if it came to fighting
          Christian mountaineers.</p></item>
        <label>(6)</label>
        <item><persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> said withdrawal of US forces at this
         time would be a certain means of accomplishing the end of Lebanon and of delivering it to
         the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He felt departure of our troops at current
         critical juncture might serve fatally to excite passions on both sides, Moslem and
         Christian.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>I told former President I regarded situation as exceedingly grave. Lebanon now seemed in
       greater danger of falling apart than even in worst period of previous crisis when the Casbah
       was Moslem and not Christian as at present. I asked if he wished me to attempt to negotiate
       with General <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> said he would be grateful as he believed <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> trusted me. He said once more to make certain of his three main points:
       His continued readiness to support <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>; his
       preference for a truly neutral government; but his readiness reluctantly to accept
        Karame.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">In telegram 1816 from Beirut, October 3, <persName

       communiqué from French text collated with an Arabic text which <persName>Takla</persName>
       also handed me. Department will note there are several significant drafting changes designed
       no doubt with a view to Karami not placing himself by implication in a position of having
       approved request of previous Lebanese Government for our landings here.<note n="6"
        xml:id="d343fn6">Paragraph 2 of the communiqué as revised in Lebanon reads as follows: “The
        United States sent its forces to Lebanon in the special circumstances generally known.
        Furthermore, the United States took steps in the United Nations with a view to having it
        adopt effective measures to preserve the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon
        and thus facilitate the withdrawal of the American forces.” (Telegram 1829 from

      <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0628"/>
      <p><persName>Takla</persName> said his government thought communiqué should be issued
       unilaterally by US, but with a simultaneous release in Lebanon by government radio and by
       communication to Lebanese press. I said I would ask Department’s instructions on this point
       and on substantive changes in draft text.</p>
      <p>As to question of date and hour, I suggested that possibly we could release communiqué as
       of noon Washington time Monday October 6. Foreign Minister replied he would prefer to check
       that out first with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Karami and would let me
       know. They are still seriously concerned with psychological effect of such an announcement
       coming at a moment when Christian general strike is still in full swing and government is on
       eve of releasing its decree calling for surrender of clandestine weapons.</p>
      <p>I shall continue to press for a rapid decision on this point, but would appreciate
       Department’s urgent comment on Lebanese amendments.<note n="7" xml:id="d343fn7">The
        Department replied, in telegram 1447 to Beirut, October 4, that it could not accept the
        revisions to the draft communiqué proposed by the Lebanese Government. The revisions, the
        Department felt, would radically alter the nature of the communiqué and put the
        circumstances under which U.S. forces entered Lebanon in an unclear light. Since the
        communiqué was to be released unilaterally by the United States rather than jointly, the
        Department intended to use the language originally proposed, with some modification to meet
        Karame’s sensibilities. (Department of State, Central Files, 783A.00/10–358) <persName

         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> was still sorely disturbed over the probable effect on
        the Christian population, but conceded that the announcement proposed by the United States
        could be made on October 8, as there would then be a responsible government with, he hoped,
        a vote of confidence. (Telegram 1843 from Beirut, October 4; <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi>

      <p>1844. This evening <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> confided to me his hope
       political crisis in Lebanon will find a solution in next two days.</p>
      <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0630"/>
      <p>President said idea of holding fast to Karami Cabinet until after vote of confidence was
       now “chambardee”. In other words, that too rigid objective had been upset by event. He had
       had a very long conversation yesterday with <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> who
       in turn had reported back to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>; and today
        <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> had returned with proposals for a new slate.
       On Moslem side <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had likewise been busy; Karami
       was coming in a few minutes to discuss possible shifts in his government. Although Karami
       might have to accept some names submitted by <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>,
       there would be others which <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> on his part must
       accept. I told President that <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> had sent a
       message to me this morning indicating he hoped to see me further to discuss political crisis.
       We agreed it would give <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> publicity if I should
       return to his mountain grandstand but <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> asked
       that I send an emissary to counsel former President that in interest of Lebanon he must not
       be too intransigeant in squabble over names in next Ministry. I plan to undertake such a
       démarche with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> tomorrow.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said situation had looked very ugly indeed
       last night but that there were “still a few common sense people left in Lebanon” and leaders
       on both sides, realizing country was speeding toward the brink, had imposed on more fanatic
       elements, both Christian and Moslem, and had dragged them back to their senses. Given this
       development and effective comportment of armed forces <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> now believed an agreed solution would be found within next 48 hours. He
       said explicitly there would be a refashioning of Karami Cabinet and that vote of confidence
       must come after new Ministry had been announced and not before as he and Karami had at first
       hoped. As indicated in my preceding telegram,<note n="2" xml:id="d345fn2">Reference is to
        telegram 1843 from Beirut; see <ref target="#d343fn7">footnote 7, Document
        343</ref>.</note><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought a government would be
       formed and a vote of confidence given by Wednesday October 8. I told President there were two
       observations I was pleased to pass on from another General Officer. This morning General
       Adams had told me that Lebanese Army had done an absolutely topnotch professional job in
       restoring order in Beirut. I said that Adams, who is one of the most competent soldiers I
       know, was not a man given to gratuitous compliments. This touched <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> very deeply as I knew it would. I then said General Adams had offered a
       suggestion which I thought had great merit; i.e., that at this critical juncture Lebanese
       people would probably react affirmatively to a nationwide broadcast by <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> himself calling on all factions to transcend their
       differences for the good of the republic. I pointed out newspapers in Beirut are so violently
       partisan that no one can get an unbiased picture of what is going on whereas government radio
       is listened to by everyone. <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0631"/><persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> thought this a good idea and said he thought he might
       make such a broadcast once new government was formed and before parliamentary vote of
       confidence.</p>
      <p>As a last item of business Tasked General if report were correct that Syrian Druzes who
       have been supporting Jumblatt were on point of mobilizing to return to Syria. <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said this was in fact true and they had turned their
       weapons in to Jumblatt. He thought it better however that no publicity attend the event but
       added significantly “<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> knows about it.”</p>
      <p>My over-all impression from this conversation and other reports during day is that
       political abcess will shortly break and that the fever will commence to subside next
        week.<note n="3" xml:id="d345fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> revised

      <head>346. Editorial Note</head>
      <p>On October 8, the Department of State released an announcement concerning the withdrawal of
       U.S. forces from Lebanon which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“The Government of the United States announces that by agreement with the Government of
         the Republic of Lebanon it has now been decided to complete withdrawal of United States
         forces from Lebanon. It is expected that, barring unforeseen developments, the forces will
         all be withdrawn by the end of October.</p>
        <p>“The United States sent forces to Lebanon in response to the urgent appeal of the then
         government of that country for assistance in maintaining Lebanese independence and
         integrity. At the same time the United States took steps in the United Nations with a view
         to having it take measures to preserve the independence and territorial integrity of
         Lebanon and thus facilitate the withdrawal of the United States forces. Subsequently the
         United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution developed by the Arab
         states and designed to ensure respect by states for the freedom, independence <pb n="600"
          xml:id="pg_600" facs="0632"/>and integrity of other states, and to establish practical
         arrangements to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter in relation to
         Lebanon.</p>
        <p>“The steps which have been taken with respect to the situation in Lebanon have led to a
         substantial improvement in the international aspects of the Lebanese security situation.
         The current unrest appears to have essentially domestic origins. In view of the progress
         made toward more stable international conditions in the area, it has been concluded that
         United States forces can now be totally withdrawn from Lebanon. It is the confident hope of
         the United States Government that the Republic of Lebanon, its sovereignty and independence
         strengthened, will move forward in unity, peace, and prosperity.” (<hi rend="italic"

        continuing impasse in the political crisis. As the Embassy saw it, the stumbling block to
        settlement was the inability to agree whether the reconstitution of the cabinet should take
        place before or after the vote of confidence in the Parliament. (<hi rend="italic"
         >Ibid.,</hi> 783A.00/10–858; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> I saw <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> last night at Junieh. He went over political crisis in
       great detail and seemed obviously happy to have a friend to confide in who had no personal
       interest in current intrigues.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said that after consultation with leaders of
       the Basta Karami had been “très chic” and had offered his resignation. Sticking point, as we
       have previously reported, was whether vote of confidence in Karami Cabinet should be taken
       before or after broadening of that government. Neither side would back down and, in
       consequence, general had now decided it was necessary to form another type of government.</p>
      <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0633"/>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has in mind a “neutral” cabinet made up
       largely of military officers with a leavening of experienced civilians. He said, for example,
       that the most important posts of Foreign and Economic Affairs and Finance would be intrusted
       to Takla. Prime Minister would be either Nazim Akkari Sunni Moslem Chef de Cabinet at Prime
       Minister’s office, an old wheelhorse in the Civil Service who once held Prime Ministership
       for three days in 1952, or Achmed Daouk, longtime Ambassador in Paris, also a Sunni Moslem
       who has a good reputation and is regarded as completely non-partisan.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_GP4"
        >Gemayel</persName> had been extremely conciliatory and sincerely anxious to put an end to
       strike. Had he to deal only between Karami and <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName>,
       crisis would have ended some days ago. However, President put his finger on <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> as being the dominant influence on so-called loyalist
       side and said he was more concerned with <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s
       attitude than he was with that of Moslem leaders. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> asked me if I could see <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>
       urgently this morning to endeavor to secure former President’s assurances he would not
       sabotage this last minute attempt to form a care-taker government which could at least
       reestablish order and permit Lebanon to start long road back toward reconstruction. I said I
       would do what I could.<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"

      <p>1901. Publication of our communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">See <ref target="#d346"
         >Document 346</ref>.</note> on withdrawal of forces has raised new furor in Moslem
       population of Lebanon who have <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0634"/>construed phrase in
       first paragraph, “barring unforeseen developments”, as deliberately intended to foreshadow
       indefinite stay of US troops in this country.</p>
      <p>This morning President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Foreign Minister
        <persName>Takla</persName> separately spoke to me of their great concern over this palpable
       distortion of our intent and agreed with me that, taken in context of entire communiqué, this
       clause bore on international security situation rather than on internal affairs of Lebanon.
       However, they said reasonably enough that one could not expect reason from the Moslem
       faction. In particular, Karami was extremely exercised and wanted a note sent to us formally
       demanding withdrawal of US forces at once.</p>
      <p>I pointed out to President and later to Takla, whom I have just seen, that such a note
       could make Lebanon Government seem ridiculous coming on top of our published communiqué, and
       that anything Karami might say should be uttered with extreme care lest he should find
       himself mouth piece for radio Cairo, Damascus, Moscow and Peking.</p>
      <p>At Takla suggestion we then went up to see Prime Minister Karami, who made some extremely
       cordial statements about his personal regard for me and his appreciation for all the US had
       done for Lebanon. He did say, however, that clause “barring unforeseen developments” had
       “torpedoed” agreement on withdrawal in eyes of Moslem population.</p>
      <p>I suggested that one way to ease Karami’s problem might be for Admiral <persName
        corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and me to pay a call on him this afternoon in his
       capacity as Minister of National Defense in order to present Admiral Ekstrom, new Commander
       of Sixth Fleet. It could be announced after visit that <gloss target="#t_CINCSPECOMME1"
        >CINCSPECOMME</gloss> and COMMANDERSIXTHFLEET had discussed with Prime Minister details of
       American withdrawal. To this suggestion all agreed. Takla likewise indicated he would like to
       send me a letter couched in very friendly terms expressing gratification for US aid and
       understanding of Lebanese Government that in fact our troops will leave by end of October. I
       said I should be glad informally to go over proposed text of such a letter this
        afternoon.<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">In telegram 1908 from Beirut, October 9, <persName
         corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> reported that Takla had conveyed to him the letter
        outlined in this telegram. He also reported that the meeting of Admirals <persName
         corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> and Ekstrom with Karame “went off very smoothly.”
         <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName> gave Karame an off-the-record indication
        of his evacuation plans and the Prime Minister was visibly relieved. (Department of State,
        Central Files, 783A.00/10–958; included in the microfiche supplement)</note></p>
      <p>I believe these measures will forestall angry blast from Karami which might have had
       adverse propaganda repercussions in Middle East and been exploited by Communist media.</p>

      <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName></hi>:
       Thank you very much for your most interesting and informative letter of October 2 and the
       enclosed copy of the “Talking Paper"<note n="2" xml:id="d349fn2">Neither found.</note>
       prepared for the Secretary’s use in possible discussion with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5"
        >Fawzi</persName>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, since your letter was not remarked “Personal”, it was opened as another
       piece of official correspondence. I have warned all those who handled the document of its
       very sensitive nature and will carefully refrain from any reference to it even among members
       of the country team.</p>
      <p>May I take this opportunity to heartily endorse the Department’s latest approach to the
       knotty problem of our future relations with the Arab states. I have already made known my
       feelings on this subject in commenting on the draft Middle East policy paper now in
       preparation as requested by the Department a few days ago.</p>
      <p>It is quite apparent that Jordan as a non-viable state cannot long endure unless it reaches
       some accommodation with its Arab neighbors, all of whom are in some degree hostile to the
       present Hussein/RIFAI regime, although admittedly for different reasons. In my own opinion,
       despite all the current talk here in Amman about lifting martial law, the actual facts are
       that any such undertaking is impossible without endangering the security of the country and
       setting the stage for some kind of coup d’etat. This will apply equally to any successor
       government to the Rifai administration which does not have a decidedly pro-<persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> coloration. Furthermore, Jordan is no Iraq. It would be
       quite impossible for a single brigade to walk into Amman in the early hours of the morning
       and seize control of the vital installations without having to fight those Jordan army units
       already on duty in the city, unless, of course, a deal had been made among the senior army
       officers to effect such a coup. However, in such a case, it would most likely result in a
       military junta taking over, since the only civilians are retread politicians of doubtful
       integrity seeking only to gain personal political advantage for themselves and their
       followers.</p>
      <p>At the moment Prime Minister Rifai, despite his admitted unpopularity not only among the
       general public but also the members of Parliament and even his own cabinet, appears to enjoy
       King Hussein’s favor. Furthermore, it must be recognized that the King is the only <pb
        n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0636"/>person who can remove him. It is my belief Rifai will
       in all probability enjoy the King’s favor so long as he can “keep the lid on” internally and,
       what is even more important, continue to demonstrate to Hussein’s satisfaction his ability to
       get American aid without which the armed forces cannot be paid. If and when Rifai fails on
       either one of the foregoing counts, then he will have outlived his usefulness to Hussein and
       probably will be dumped. This in turn will necessitate Jordan finding another “angel” or
       drastically reducing the size of its armed forces, either of which will invite opposition
       forces both from within and from without the country to make a bid for power.</p>
      <p>It is possible that a series of caretaker-type governments may succeed Rifai, each in turn
       having to give up as its inability to satisfy the demands of the extreme nationalists becomes
       apparent. This process could only take place, of course, providing the Jordan army was either
       neutralized through internal dissension or chose to take a neutral position so long as
       nothing was done to unseat the King, providing they elect to remain loyal to him. This will
       to a large degree depend on how far the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       influence has penetrated the army or whether the Bani Sakhir, largest of the Bedouin tribes,
       decides to replace the monarchy with a paramount sheikh of their own, a process which would
       be quite readily understood by the predominantly Bedouin population of the East Bank.
       Incidentally, this is not too far fetched because of the traditional tribal jealousy among
       the northern and southern tribes, some of which believe that the Hashemites should never have
       been set up as the supreme ruler in the first place. No matter what means are used to bring
       about a change in the present Jordan government it is most unlikely that the process can run
       its natural course toward Arab nationalism of the <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> variety without some bloodshed and disorders. If and when that time
       comes, there is a distinct possibility that any symbols of “western imperialism” may become
       the natural target against which the Jordanian public, long held down by martial law, may
       vent their spleen.</p>
      <p>Under these circumstances it is not improbable that unless or until U.S. policy toward the
       Middle East in general and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in particular is
       modified the position of our mission in Amman, including Point IV and <gloss
        target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, may well become similar to that in the U.A.R. and Iraq.</p>
      <p>I didn’t really intend to make this letter so long but once having begun it, I felt that
       you might like to have on a personal and unofficial basis the benefit of my thinking on what
       I consider to be a potentially explosive situation.</p>

       after his attempt at forming a military government presided over by a neutral Moslem had
       failed yesterday. He confirmed reports we had earlier reported that Basta mob got somewhat
       out of control, threatening Karami with death if he turned in his resignation. (I suspect,
       however, mob was incited to this demonstration and that Karami and company did not need much
       urging to hang on to their cherished portfolios.) At all events, formula which had been
       accepted by Phalange and Moslem opposition fell through. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> thought there was a good chance of returning to former course of action,
       namely to widen membership in Karami Cabinet to include pro-<persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> loyalist and perhaps representation from the Phalange. He said <persName
        corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> was meeting with Karami that evening to discuss these
       possibilities.</p>
      <p>I next called on <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> who was smooth as oiled-silk. After
       proudly showing me his arsenal of home-made submachine guns (“the Basta has the best”), he
       said that morning a committee of 25 Moslem leaders had met to discuss what to do next.
        <persName corresp="#p_ACR2">Abdullah</persName> Yafi tabled a motion calling for no
       modification whatsoever in Karami Cabinet; but other leaders of a more moderate stripe had
       later privately agreed they would go along with a compromise for a widened Karami Cabinet
       along lines suggested by <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most significant thing <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName> told me was that mobs on
       both sides, Christian and Moslem, were getting very tired and increasingly impatient that
       their leaders find a solution. He added it was significant that during day Beirut had been
       quiet and there had been no retaliatory kidnappings.</p>
      <p>When I called on <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> after leaving the Basta, I
       found him on verge of desperation. He said a three-hour meeting with Karami had produced no
       result. He was convinced Karami and his backers were not sincere in their professed readiness
       to have a truly representative cabinet. They were only willing to take in a few face-saving
       personalities <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0638"/>but would not honestly seek for an
       arrangement of “no victor, no vanquished.” Under these circumstances, said <persName
        corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName>, neither the Phalange nor their followers could agree to
       a Karami Cabinet.</p>
      <p>I inquired what would happen if <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> could
       resuscitate idea which had so nearly proved successful previous day of a military government
       of officers presided over by a civilian. <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName>, who
       was accompanied by Secretary of the party and by former Minister of Finance Joseph Chader,
       said with their concurrence that Phalange would support such a cabinet. <persName
        corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> said that after his conversation with <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> previous evening he had <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName>’s agreement to an immediate lifting of strike if a military government
       were formed, <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> to restrict his opposition to a
       purely parliamentary one. Phalange leader told me if such a government were appointed, it
       would receive a vote of confidence, as <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> could
       not corner more than 20 votes against such a grouping. <persName corresp="#p_GP4"
        >Gemayel</persName> implored me to seek <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> again
       that night to announce that he create such a government forthwith. He thought this would have
       such a magical effect on country it would eliminate strike and restore order provided
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> stood firm.</p>
      <p>I thereupon resumed my weary journeying to Junieh and called on <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> at 10 p.m. He was interested in negative result of <persName
        corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName>–Karami interview and in possibility of resuscitating
       idea of a military cabinet; but said his concern now was not to upset Moslem apple cart in
        <persName>Tripoli</persName> and <persName>Saida</persName>. He speculated as to possibility
       of a military cabinet presided over by Karami but agreed when I pointed out Christians would
       be up in arms at such an arrangement unless there were a balance of strongly pro-loyalist
       Christian ministers.</p>
      <p>President concluded a long day by saying he thought both sides were now so groggy with
       fatigue they would eventually stumble to some sort of live and let live solution. He noted
       (and our individual observation corroborates it) that, despite continuance of Christian
       strike, town is slowly opening and main thoroughfares are free of barricades. <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said he thought there would be a long weekend of
       continued negotiations ending Monday or Tuesday with formation of a compromise government,
       with parliament to meet immediately thereafter.</p>

         ><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> began an 11-nation trip on September 19 to
        examine mutual security programs and economic problems. He met with <persName

       with <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> in Istanbul. On premise that Lebanon
       successful in forming coalition government country team recommends total of $25 million
       budget support for period ending September 31, 1959. (This is $20 million in addition to $5
       million already allotted.) <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> feels that this
       should be one time operation and that thereafter Lebanon should be able take care of herself
       except for such concrete development projects as might meet standards of <gloss
        target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. Funds presently programmed for Lebanon should be adequate
       until first of year when additional funds could be obtained through supplemental
       appropriation.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> also recommends sharp reduction leading
       to early termination of technical assistance program in Lebanon. Lebanese neither want nor
       require assistance and do not appreciate such technical assistance as they have received. I
       recommend acceptance this recommendation but no action to withdraw personnel until Lebanese
       Government formed and we are in position talk to them about budgetary support.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> emphasized importance of aid for AUB
       which he feels is our greatest asset in Middle East. I informed him that moderate sums were
       programmed for AUB in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59.</p>
      <p>On military assistance <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> informs me that
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and government primarily interested in

       assistance as case for larger armed forces did not seem good and we are attempting cutback on
       military assistance wherever possible. <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>
       then said he felt it might be desirable cancel scheduled deliveries Hawker Hunters since they
       would be of no use to Lebanon and since Lebanese did not seem particularly interested in them
       and preferred equipment for ground forces. He will look into matter further and send definite
       recommendation to Washington. I told him that reprogramming these funds might be only source
       for military assistance to Lebanon.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Rifai once again raised question delivery Hawker-Hunter aircraft. He said in
       view withdrawal British aircraft by end October essential new planes be flown in rather than
       shipped by sea, not only because time factor but even more important Jordan lacked facility
       reassemble them. I informed Rifai we had encouraging signs <gloss target="#t_UAR1"

       out with British firm delivery date Cyprus from where aircraft could be flown Amman in less

      <p>RIFAI expressed misgivings Lebanese situation, called four-man Cabinet announced today a

      <p>Ambassador Rifai expressed his Government’s gratitude for the decisive stand which the
       United States, under the leadership of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
        >Eisenhower</persName> and the Secretary, had taken in the recent Middle East crisis. He
       said people in the Near East tend to believe in what they see and to “follow the prevailing
       wind.” When United States policy was translated into action by our support of Lebanon and
       Jordan, people realized in a tangible way the value of cooperation and friendship with the
       United States and felt confidence that they could rely on the United States in the future.
       The Ambassador felt that Jordan had come out of the recent crisis very successfully; the Arab
       resolution had been a good development and there had been no criticism of Jordan by the other
       Arab states during the present session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
       Assembly.</p>
      <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0642"/>
      <p>The Secretary, in replying to the Ambassador, said that he wished to express his thanks for
       the words of appreciation for our efforts which the Ambassador had spoken. He said that our
       response to the appeals of Lebanon and Jordan for help against indirect aggression was
       evidence of the sincerity of our concern for the independence and integrity of small nations
       and of our great respect for the efforts of the King and the Government to preserve Jordan’s
       independence. We were gratified that the situation appeared somewhat more stable for the
       future than it was at one time in the past.</p>
      <p>The Secretary, turning to the subject of Jordan’s more long-range prospects, observed that
       it would not be sound or practical for the United States to continue financial support to
       Jordan at the present level indefinitely. The long-range problem for Jordan was one of
       developing the country’s own resources so as to permit it to exist independent of outside
       help. This would require austerity—which admittedly was not easy when there was some prospect
       of a need for even greater military expenditures.</p>
      <p>When asked later if he had specific advice which the Ambassador might carry back to Jordan,
       the Secretary replied that he didn’t feel qualified to offer advice but asked the Ambassador
       to express the great admiration which the President, he himself, and the American people
       generally felt for the courage and vigor which the King and the Jordan Government had shown.
       He observed that in the dangerous world in which we live people can’t be safe unless they are
       prepared to be bold and courageous, as witnessed by the recent example of the crisis over
       Quemoy and Matsu. He added that people who are disposed to stand up for themselves, even
       though they are small, attract support, while people who give in only isolate themselves.</p>
      <p>In Jordan’s case, the Secretary said there was still the long-range problem arising out of
       the fact that Jordan was essentially an artificial state carved out of the old Palestine
       Mandate by the British to serve as a strategic base in the area. This concept was now
       outmoded and the British were no longer in a position to support Jordan. The long-range
       solution of this problem would appear to require that Jordan at some time reach an honorable
       understanding with its neighbors which would permit it to enjoy a greater measure of economic
       well-being. This was not easy. The Arab Union would have been a sound step had it been
       possible to carry it through, but it was doubtful whether union with Iraq would be a sound
       step today since the situation in Iraq was not yet stabilized. However, something might prove
       possible in the future.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Rifai agreed that Jordan must seek an understanding with its neighbors. He
       observed that Jordan does not believe that the union of Syria and Egypt will necessarily
       prove permanent. He believed that there might be as much chance for Jordan in combination <pb
        n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0643"/>with Syria and with Iraq, particularly in view of King
       Hussein’s special qualifications. Events in the Middle East often take place suddenly, and
       anything is possible.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador thanked the Secretary for receiving him and said that he expected to be
       stopping briefly in London on his way back to Jordan. He would be leaving New York in a few
       days and was happy to be able to carry back to his Government the Secretary’s comments.</p>

      <p>During a general discussion of the situation in Jordan, the Secretary inquired whether the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> economic blockade of Jordan had been lifted. Ambassador
       Rifai replied that although he had received repeated assurances that the ban on transit of
       goods through <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> territory and overflights by Jordanian
       aircraft would be lifted, the physical blockade was still in effect. He cited a recent letter
       from Secretary General Hammarskjold containing assurances that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> had promised to lift the blockade. The Ambassador felt that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s failure to carry out these promises to date indicated
       bad faith on his part. He said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FM5">Fawzi</persName> had
       implied that some Lebanese Ministers were objecting to the lifting of the blockade at the
       instigation of Syrian elements who were against the improvement of relations with Jordan.</p>
      <p>This led Ambassador Rifai to comment that it would appear at present that only Syria was
       the source of trouble for Jordan. The situation in Lebanon seemed to be much improved; Iraq
       was not causing difficulties; Jordan was on good terms with Saudi Arabia, where the King
       seemed to be improving his position, and even Cairo <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0644"
       />gave evidence of a desire for better relations. He was hopeful that in the future Jordan
       could be a stabilizing influence in the area. In this, Jordan relied upon US aid and would
       continue to do so.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador wondered whether the Secretary would care to put some additional pressure on
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with respect to lifting the blockade of Jordan. The
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops were withdrawing, the Secretary General had given
       assurances that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was going to remove its restrictions,
       and Jordan did not wish to disrupt the present trend by renewing the propaganda war.</p>
      <p>When the Secretary expressed some doubt as to what he might be able to do, especially since
       our own relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> were not of the best, the
       Ambassador urged that the United States put in a word with the Secretary General urging him
       to renew his efforts at securing full <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> compliance with the
       Arab resolution. The Secretary replied that he saw no reason why we couldn’t speak to Mr.
        <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> along these lines and indicated that appropriate steps
       would be taken through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>

      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on October 16 on significant world developments
       affecting U.S. security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered the
       following assessment of developments in Lebanon and Jordan: <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“In Lebanon, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the new stop-gap
         Cabinet has ended for the moment the strikes and violence of recent months. The new Cabinet
         was about evenly divided between the Moslems and the Christians, although the choicest
         portfolios had gone to the Moslems. Even so, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought this
         was an encouraging development in the Lebanese picture.</p>
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that the evacuation of British
         forces from Jordan was beginning. The future of that country would, of course, be discussed
         in connection with the agenda item covering a new U.S. policy toward the Near East. King
         Hussein was planning to take a vacation out of the country, although it was singularly
         difficult to find an appropriate time for him to take a vacation.</p>
        <p>“The President inquired whether the British forces would be flown out of Jordan over a
         corner of Syria. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> replied that these
         troops would be flown out, the bulk of them through Syria.” (Memorandum of discussion at

      <p>1983. Since formation of new government reported Embassy telegram 1966<note n="2"
        xml:id="d356fn2">In telegram 1966 from Beirut, October 15, the Embassy reported that
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> had formed a new cabinet consisting of Rashid
        Karame as Prime Minister, and Minister of Defense, Finance, Economy, and Information;
        Hussein Oueini as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Planning; Raymond Edde as
        Minister of Interior and Social Affairs; and <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Pierre
         Gemayel</persName> as Minister of Public Works, Education, Agriculture, and Health. Karame
        and Oueini were Sunni Moslems and <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> and Edde
        were Maronite Christians. Following the announcement of the establishment of the cabinet,
        the Phalange issued a statement calling off their strike, and an impending trade union
        strike was also cancelled. The Embassy reported that the cabinet was being popularly
        referred to in Lebanon as the “cabinet of salvation.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
        783A.00/10–1558)</note> I have made separate calls on President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and on each of the new ministers.</p>
      <p>Recalling prediction he had made as outlined last paragraph Embassy telegram 1931,<note

        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said on Saturday night he had given Moslem opposition an
       ultimatum that if they did not consent to some reasonable solution of crisis he would resign
       as President of Lebanon. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> intimated he had been
       equally firm with Christian Loyalists. He expressed great vexation at attitude of Jumblat and
       spoke with some irony of Druze chieftain’s pretension to be a spiritual leader, whereas in
       reality all he wanted was a ministerial portfolio for himself. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> said final compromise reached at one a.m. yesterday excluded many
       confessional factions but did give justice to main division of Lebanon between Islam and
       Christianity. He was optimistic that new government would be able to get on with its job.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Hussein Oueini (who was visibly pleased that US Ambassador was first of
       diplomatic corps to call on him) was exceedingly cordial and made pleasant sounds of his
       willingness to settle any problems which might come up between Lebanon and US on a basis of
       trust and friendship. He did, however, put in a plug for <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614"

       could contribute to rapid and just solution of Palestine refugee problem this would do more
       than anything to improve US relations with “50 million Arabs”.</p>
      <p>Rashid Karami told me this morning country is rapidly returning to a peace-time basis. His
       reports from Tripoli, Saida, Tyre and Bekaa all confirmed that security situation is calm.
       Like his colleagues, he expressed optimism and pleased surprise at almost magical change in
       atmosphere of Beirut.</p>

        (Department of State, Central Files, 883A.10/10–2358; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> I saw Prime Minister Karami this morning.</p>
      <p>I said United States might be able to help Lebanon in recovering from effects of almost
       half a year of civil war but we could not even estimate our ability to aid without a firm
       statistical basis as to financial <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0648"/>situation in which
       Lebanese Government found itself. Upshot of a long interview was agreement that when each
       ministry had submitted its budget estimates for next calendar year, which are due to be
       presented Karami November 5, and a consolidated draft budget has been rounded out, which he
       thinks will be between November 10 and 15, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and Embassy
       economic experts will be called in to go over the books. Karami agreed to make a complete and
       honest revelation of income accounts, proposed disbursements and calculations under headings
       of reconstruction and development (first paragraph <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
       1600). At that time we would jointly determine what deficit, if any, <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
        >GOL</gloss> found in its forward planning but there would be no commitment on part of US to
       meet this deficit. I could only promise sympathetic study and subsequent recommendation by
       Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to Washington.</p>
      <p>Karami asked if I could let him know what global figure for aid US had in mind for Lebanon.
       I said I did not know it myself. US had many clients around the world and many demands upon
       foreign aid funds. All we could hope for was that if Lebanon could establish a clear basis of
       actual need US would regard its requirements sympathetically and do its best to help. I made
       it clear there would be no question of any lump sum annual grant to <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
        >GOL</gloss>.</p>
      <p>I mentioned in passing 8 million pounds of counterpart and found, as I expected, that Prime
       Minister had never heard of this fund. I left further elaboration on this point to await
       joint study of Embassy–<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> experts with Lebanese budget
       technicians.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister asked if there would be any strings attached to US aid, and mentioned in
       this connection <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine. I pointed out
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine was a unilateral statement of
       policy by the United States and offered personal suggestion it would be wise if neither side
       brought this issue up. What we were concerned with was a solid study in public finance and
       not in polemics on foreign policy. I likewise recalled that (Deptel 4107)<note n="4"
        xml:id="d358fn4">Telegram 4107 transmitted <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’

        >Malik</persName> in a personal communication unilateral character of <persName

      <p>I later went over main points of my conversation with Karami with my closest friend in
       government, Raymond Edde, to make sure this influential minister is conversant with my oral
       arrangements with Prime Minister. In particular, I cautioned Edde that I thought it would be
       unfortunate if Karami made any public statement about Lebanon <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617"
        facs="0649"/>and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine. I thought this

      <p rend="center">DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AFTERMATH OF US AND <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
       TROOP WITHDRAWALS FROM LEBANON AND JORDAN</p>
      <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
      <p>1. The presence of US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops in Lebanon and Jordan
       slowed down the trend in both countries toward seizure of control by local forces sympathetic
       to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. The landing of these forces has not, however,
       changed basic trends in the area and developments in both countries will continue in the
       direction of neutralism and accommodations with Pan-Arab nationalism.</p>
      <p>2. The most significant immediate consequence of the withdrawal of US and <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops will be to remove one of the most important props which
       hold up the shaky regime of King Hussein, thus increasing the danger of its overthrow and the
       likelihood of Israeli and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d359fn2">Footnote in the source text [<hi rend="italic">8½ lines of source
        text</hi>] not declassified.</note> The danger of a move to overthrow the regime will be
       particularly great during Hussein’s anticipated absence abroad in November.</p>
      <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0650"/>
      <p>3. We believe that the withdrawal of Western troops will not of itself automatically and
       precipitately lead to widespread hostilities: the withdrawal has been widely anticipated; the
       governments of the area are aware of the possibility that the collapse of the Jordanian
       regime could lead to an Arab-Israeli war; and these governments probably do not desire such a
       war at the present time. Nevertheless, the situation, especially in Jordan, will be delicate.
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may miscalculate the risks in the situation
       and Arab extremists both in and out of Jordan might take independent action to overthrow the
       regime.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Lebanon</hi></p>
      <p>4. The withdrawal of US forces from Lebanon is not likely to produce any marked or sudden
       change in the situation in that country. The struggle between the Christian and Moslem
       elements is likely to continue for some time and to involve occasional resort to force, but
       we believe that large-scale outbreaks in the near future are not likely.</p>
      <p>5. The future of Lebanon’s present compromise government and, indeed, of President
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is not clear. The preferential position of the
       Christians in political life has been seriously weakened, and the Moslems may seek to push
       their gains to the point where the Christians will feel compelled to strike back in
       force.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi></p>
      <p>6. In the face of threats by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and by Jordanian
       Pan-Arab nationalists, Hussein has been sustained by the Jordanian Army and by the aid and
       support of the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Another force counteracting Arab
       nationalist pressures has been Israel, which has threatened to intervene in Jordan in the
       event of the overthrow of Hussein’s regime.</p>
      <p>7. Maneuverings designed to reduce pressures upon Hussein and to allow him to remain on the
       throne after the withdrawal of the British troops have been underway in Jordan. If these are
       to be successful they must involve such concessions to the Pan-Arab nationalists as release
       of political prisoners and the removal of the openly pro-Western <persName>Samir
        Rifai</persName> as Prime Minister. Furthermore Rifai’s successor will have to be a
       politician acceptable to the extreme nationalist forces. Although there are a number of
       pro-Hussein politicians in Jordan who would be willing to make a try at rapprochement with
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we believe it unlikely that Hussein himself
       has much taste for such an arrangement. He probably also believes that any such arrangement
       would be short-lived. It is possible, though unlikely, that Hussein will not return to Jordan
       from his November trip.</p>
      <p>8. If Hussein continues his present government and policies after the withdrawal of <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops, we believe chances are better than even that he will be
       overthrown within a few months. The scheduled absence <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0651"
       />of Hussein from the country in the course of the coming two months will provide a
       particularly tempting opportunity for the opposition to move against the monarchy.</p>
      <p>9. There are indications that the Jordanian regime may seek a rapprochement with Iraq as a
       means of appeasing Pan-Arab sentiment without capitulating to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. At least under its present leadership, however, the Iraqi Government is not
       likely to prove receptive to overtures from the current Jordanian regime.</p>
      <p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss></p>
      <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> probably believes that important progress
       has been made for his cause in Lebanon since the outbreak of the insurrection last spring,
       and he will continue to encourage the pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Moslem group to
       establish its dominance and bring Lebanon into close alignment with the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may choose to
       move slowly in Lebanon. However, relations with the Moslem leaders in Lebanon are principally
       in the hands of Syrian Minister of Interior <persName>Serraj</persName>, who is much less
       restrained than <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and likely to continue strong
       covert efforts on behalf of the pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> group in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>11. With respect to Jordan, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would almost
       certainly prefer the evolution of a cooperative Jordanian regime which would not provide
       Israel with the occasion to intervene forcibly and which would, at least in the early stages,
       avoid loss of Western economic assistance to Jordan. However, here too his hand may be forced
       by the activities of <persName>Serraj</persName> or local Pan-Arab extremists.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Israel</hi></p>
      <p>12. Israel is unlikely to make any move in direct response to the withdrawal of US and
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops, but it will hold its forces in readiness in case
       the troop withdrawal leads to events in Jordan which it feels require intervention. Even if
       the movement of Jordan toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is gradual and
       peaceful, the danger will remain that Israel will at some point move to forestall the
       establishment of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> forces west of the Jordan.</p>
      <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
      </p>
      <p>13. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is unlikely to respond to US and <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troop withdrawals except by beating the usual propaganda drums
       against Western “imperialism.” It is unlikely to intervene more directly in the situation
       unless an Arab-Israeli war appears imminent, in which case it is likely to respond with

        >In telegram 1993 from Beirut, October 17, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1"
         >McClintock</persName> stated that he had not intended to convey the impression to Under
        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that the Lebanese Government
        preferred equipment for ground forces to delivery of the anticipated Hawker–Hunter aircraft.
        Rather, they wanted the aircraft and hoped for substantial military assistance for ground
        forces as well. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 783A.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1"
        >MSP</gloss>/10–1758) On October 20, <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>
        continued his assessment of Lebanon’s military requirements in telegram 2019 from Beirut. He
        noted that the Lebanese forces were imbued with a Maginot line mentality, and added that he,
        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HAJLJ1">Holloway</persName>, and General Adams felt that the
        United States should respond to future requests for military assistance by recommending a
        reorganization of Lebanese forces along more flexible lines. If <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> responded to that suggestion, the United States could offer to provide a
        military training mission to facilitate the change. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
        783A.5–MSP/10–2058) Both telegrams are included in the microfiche supplement)</note> We
       share Embassy view that investment USG has made in Lebanon, as well as political significance
       US-Lebanese relationship, requires substantial continuing US interest in that country. From
       political viewpoint, however, Dept coming to conclusion that while we should maintain
       attitude helpful friendliness to Lebanon, it is not to either Government’s interest seek to
       make more intimate our already close association. From financial viewpoint funds available to
       USG heavily committed.</p>
      <p>Thus, while recognizing military and security aspects of problem as thoughtfully outlined
       in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2019, Dept and Defense do not favor our
       involvement in program for reorganization and re-equipping Lebanese armed forces. We would be
       taking on responsibility which would not only involve conclusion military mission agreement
       and assignment US military personnel to Lebanon but would also entail heavy cost.</p>
      <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0653"/>
      <p>On other hand Dept sees much merit in recommendation for arranging visits and training
       programs for Lebanese officers. Although process slower and indirect, such projects could
       have some influence on Lebanese military thinking while at same time strengthening ties with
       US on part of individuals involved. Preliminary reaction this proposal is favorable and while
       specific approval being sought would appreciate Embassy’s estimate number of personnel
       involved, and suggestion re types and duration of training. Defense concurs.</p>
      <p>With reference MAP assistance, Department would welcome Embassy’s specific recommendations
       on: 1) Maintenance and ammunition requirements (final para Section 1 <gloss

      <p>The Secretary stated that apparently the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> really
       believes that something will happen in the area of the Middle East and possibly that Israel
       will take over the West bank of the Jordan now that British troops have departed.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d362fn2">The last of the British paratroopers left Jordan on October 29. The

       Israel was probably being used as a pretext by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He
       noted that we had no information from Israel indicating that they were planning any move. He
       expressed gratification that the opening of the Syrian-Jordan border had been announced.</p>
      <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> expressed the view that the
       absence of the King of Jordan at the present time was unfortunate. The Secretary said that
       the planned vacation of King Hussein also gave us cause for concern. Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that this was causing anxiety in the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> but that no action had been contemplated to the best of his
       knowledge. He thought that the Foreign Office was considering some move to try to make sure
       that at least some member of the Royal Family returned to Jordan. The Secretary noted that
       the King of course might conceivably never return to Jordan.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> stated that there was no evidence of an
       Israeli military build up but that Israeli forces in being were sufficient to take over the
       West bank should they so desire. Moreover, the Israelis could mobilize very quickly.
       Therefore the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was particularly sensitive in this respect.
       The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was making a great deal of US–<gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss>–French alleged arms programs for Israel. They had also noted with concern Ben
       Gurion’s statement on the West bank.</p>
      <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> asked if our anxiety was confined
       to Jordan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that at the present time
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> is stating that it wishes peace in Jordan and that we
       think there will probably not be any <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> move at the present
       time. The Secretary noted that the departure of US troops and the King’s leaving on vacation
       created a situation where a coup might occur.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that the compelling considerations in this situation are basic and that
       it was probably desirable to have a discussion of the problem with the King.</p>
      <p>The Secretary added that the situation would be extremely worrying should the King not
       return. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> noted that a peaceful evolution
       was possible in this case but that it seemed that serious problems would be raised if King
       Hussein did not return. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> thought that if
       the evolution in Jordan were peaceful, Israel might not <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624"
        facs="0656"/>take over the West bank of the Jordan but that Israel certainly would act to
       occupy the West bank should there be an uprising in Jordan. He thought it was fairly unlikely
       that the King would not return, particularly in the light of his recent conduct.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that we would send a message to our Embassy in Amman proposing that we
       should discuss the situation there with the British Embassy and that we should consider a
       talk with King Hussein asking for his evaluation of the situation. Apparently, if he believed
       it was prudent for him to depart on vacation now his estimate of the situation might differ
       somewhat from ours, because we had certain doubts over the situation and were interested to
       know on what basis his estimate might differ from ours. The Secretary stressed that he
       believed it would be more desirable for us to probe the King’s views rather than to issue
       some form of warning against his departure.<note n="3" xml:id="d362fn3">In telegram 1234 from
        Amman, October 31, the Embassy expressed the opinion that King Hussein definitely planned to

      <p>2222. Raymond Edde called on me this afternoon. He said Karami somehow had impression (cf.

         target="#d358">Document 358</ref>.</note> US possibility of aid for Lebanon could not
       become actual before calendar 1959. Prime Minister said Edde was being pressed by Soviet
       Ambassador to accept credits from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Karami was tempted
       in this direction because he felt there would be a budget deficit for calendar 58 which could
       not be met by US assistance.</p>
      <p>I told Edde undoubtedly their technicians had gotten confused as between US FY59 and
       calendar 59. However, in my discussions with Prime Minister I had not mentioned any dates or
       any figure of aid. We were still waiting to be invited to examine Lebanese budget and to
       ascertain if in fact there was a requirement for US assistance.</p>
      <p>Edde said so far as he knew Lebanese budget for calendar 58 would show a deficit of between
       25 and 30 million Lebanese pounds ($7.8 and 9.2 million). He said he intended to see
       President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> this evening as well as Karami and
       would recommend that our scrutiny of Lebanese budget requirements commence forthwith and not
       toward mid-November as suggested by Prime Minister (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
       2129).</p>
      <p>I said we would be willing to examine the books at any time. However I did not want anyone
       in government to have impression we would be impelled to action by prospect of Soviet entry
       into aid field. <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0658"/>If by chance <gloss

      <p>2236. Over week has passed since quiet withdrawal last American troops from Lebanon and
       predictions of certain Christian Cassandras remain happily unfulfilled. While majority
       Christians, many Shiites, and even some Sunni, would have preferred to see troops remain, we
       do not believe we have lost many friends in process. Uneasiness certainly remains in Mount
       Lebanon, and many Christians are quietly hiding guns where they can be easily found, but in
       absence of trouble criticism of American “do nothingness” has largely vanished.</p>
      <p>Former opposition after initial trumpetings of joy over departure “imperialist aggressors”
       has had little further to say. However, this refrain will undoubtedly return from
       time-to-time in future, particularly in connection with continuing flow of propaganda from
       Baghdad trials.</p>
      <p>There can be little question but that presence American forces kept Lebanese crisis from
       erupting more violently. At this juncture it seems to us our landings had indirect effect of
       forcing insurgents into cooling-off period. Left to own devices they might well have let
       emotions run away with common sense. As it was after insurgent leaders had second look at
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, particularly Syria, sovereign Lebanon looked better
       again. Many observers also feel presence our forces contributed to Moslem acceptance present
       compromise Cabinet despite inclination reap fruits of what they considered their victory.</p>
      <p>Despite fact basic issues which provoked Lebanese crisis remain unresolved, we believe
       effects of our action will continue to be felt for long time to come, both in Lebanon and
       elsewhere in Arab world. As present government cautiously feels its way through difficult
       problems <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0659"/>of internal security and external
       relations, memory of landings will encourage some, act as brake on others, and in general
       continue to induce spirit of compromise so necessary to existence of Lebanon.</p>
      <p>In a broader strategic sense US landing was an eminently successful exercise in limited
       war. We believe it served to check both Soviet and Nasserite aspirations, while at same time
       heartening our friends in free world. It is significant that none of standard indicators of
       so-called “imperialist aggression” was associated with American landing. I am discussing
       propaganda aspects of this fact in a letter sent today to Director <persName

       Osseiran, former President <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, President <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Minister Raymond Edde. Upshot of impressions gained

       months (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2247)<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2">Telegram

       there was an incredible plethora of useless people in Lebanese Government, although in

       which some officials received salaries grossly in excess of standard pay scale for other
       bureaucrats. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> indicated a general overhaul of

      <p>Although Chamoun said his party had yet to adopt its line of policy toward bill on full
       powers, I got definite impression that after securing some amendments to show his party must
       be reckoned with and his leadership acknowledged <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> would go along in supporting government’s request. My most outstanding
       impression of a day of visits was marked change which has come over <persName
        corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. He proved exceedingly moderate in his comments and the
       old flush of egotism enhanced by adulation which had marked his attitude during my interviews
       when he was on the mountain had completely disappeared.</p>
      <p>He now spoke soberly of situation in which Lebanon found itself and of need to support
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Karami Government in meeting urgent and
       difficult problems. It was also interesting to see that <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
        >Chamoun</persName> was voicing theories on economic development which had originated with
       Raymond Edde and been implanted in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> before they
       emerged from mouth of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>.</p>
      <p>I found <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> absorbed in fairly constructive ideas
       on what to do about Lebanon in realm of social policy and of reconstruction. As in case of
        <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, I have discerned a marked change in the
       general. He is beginning to like being President of Lebanon and with each week in office he
       gains new assurance. Although there are admittedly many deficiencies in the governance of
       this strife-torn republic, I have very clear impression that under present management, and
       particularly with the courageous and energetic Raymond Edde personally tackling problem of
       internal security, the present team will be able to surmount its difficulties.</p>
      <p>On question of foreign aid, Edde tells me Karami is still tempted by prospect of accepting
       both US and Soviet assistance. Apparently he was buoyed up by a friendly telegram of
       congratulations from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. However I found
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> exceedingly cautious toward every aspect of
       relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Far from evincing any desire to accept
       Russian assistance, he went so far as to say he wanted to go very slowly even before
       contemplating trade arrangements with Russia.</p>
      <p>As for our own contemplated economic and technical assistance to Lebanon, General now fully
       understands question of eight million pounds of counterpart which still remains to be used
       and my final arrangement with Karami for a joint study by Lebanese and US experts of
       budgetary and economic facts upon which any consideration of request for aid must rest.
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> also very clearly comprehends that if we do
       furnish assistance it will be in modest proportions.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> said last night he had come to conclusion
       Lebanon must have advice of foreign experts if it were to improve its government and services
       which people had a right to expect. He said he hoped he could count on Point Four technical
       assistance in this regard. I said my overall <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0661"/>review
       of our efforts in this field had led me to a personal disappointment so far as effect on
       US-Lebanese relations had been concerned; however, if there were real needs and Lebanese
       Government felt US experts could help to meet these needs, I was sure my government would
       give sympathetic consideration to requests for help.</p>
      <p>As result of my opening gambit with Karami, whenever I said I thought our aid program might
       very well be phased down and out we now find (as we had expected) a growing concern lest
       technical assistance be completely withdrawn.</p>
      <p>I believe stage has now been set for a friendly and frank consideration across the board of
       the entire aid program, with initiative in American hands.</p>
      <p>Karami telephoned this morning to request that expert scrutiny of budget commence tomorrow
       at 9 a.m.</p>

         (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>883A.00–TA/11–1358; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> which furnished opportune policy guidance.</p>
      <p>I have discussed Lebanese aid and budget problem with a number of responsible people
       including most recently President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, with whom I
       had a long and frank conversation last night. I find in <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> and his more alert ministers, as well as in a variety of disparate
       elements (e.g., such widely differing characters as Emile Bustany and Kamal Jumblat), a
       persistent belief that if Lebanese Govt can promptly initiate a program of planned
       expenditure, particularly in public works sector, pump will be primed for a rapid return of
       Lebanese economy to normal. From aspect of internal security and interest economics,
        <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and his ministers are keenly anxious to
       commence a program which would relieve destitution and provide work at such neuralgic points
       as Tripoli, certain regions in the mountains and the depressed area of Tyre and Sidon. We
       concur that there is need for such an exercise of leadership, and if it is made possible by
       our aid we should share in political dividends which will accrue.</p>
      <p>Before making our specific recommendations I should like to recall certain basic facts
       which condition our judgment of situation: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Lebanon for first time in its brief history has a president who is incorruptible.
         Likewise, for first time in Lebanese history all ministers of govt are men of personal
         integrity. This is thus a unique situation in which content [<hi rend="italic"
         >intent?</hi>] of top management in this country is to run an honest administration. We
         should be naive, however, to believe that throughout ranks of bureaucracy there will be an
         equal standard of public conduct. Nevertheless, from aspect of how US taxpayers funds are
         used, we do have at present time in Lebanon an honest chief of state and an honest
         Cabinet.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>One political observer has remarked to me that US area-wise has an unusual, although
         perhaps fleeting, opportunity to use an imaginative and bold aid program for Lebanon with a
         view to furthering US policy interests elsewhere. This observer points out that [to] many
         Moslem Arabs Karami is identified as a follower of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName>. Although it would seem strange outside Arab world, there is validity
         to argument that if Karami asks for and receives a grant of US aid it will be interpreted
         in other Arab countries as indication that US is a friend of free Arab nations and that
          <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not sole purveyor to Arab nationalism.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>So far as political impact is concerned, a cash grant of US aid made now (and which
         Karami and company would play up as being without strings attached) will have great effect
         in Lebanese leadership circles, including particularly Moslems who have been inclined to
         regard past US gestures in offering aid as designed with politically <pb n="631"
          xml:id="pg_631" facs="0663"/>ulterior motives. As indicated in preceding paragraph, an
         offer of such US aid made now we think will also have impact politically outside
         Lebanon.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>In my conversations with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and his
         ministers I have indicated belief that if Lebanon with our immediate assistance can get its
         economy back on the road there should be no further requirement for aid of an extraordinary
         nature. Such future assistance as US might subsequently be called upon to offer would then
         be in the way of technical assistance along lines foreshadowed Icato 232, plus judicious
         resort to <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Given this analysis of situation, I recommend that we at once make available to Lebanon sum
       of ten million dollars of grant aid as a one-shot, non-recurring operation. This would not
       fully meet their own estimate of complete deficit for Lebanese fiscal 1958, which, as
       indicated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2404, comes close to 37 million pounds,
       but it would be generally accepted not only by the experts but by ministers and public
       opinion as being a grant-in-aid which in effect closes books on recent civil war, places
       government in a solvent position and moves Lebanon up to the point of a new year starting in
       January 1959 from which it can move forward under its own momentum. The figure of ten million
       dollars is in our considered judgment the minimum amount which can achieve these objectives
       with major credit accruing to the US.</p>
      <p>I believe this offer of a grant-in-aid would be generally interpreted throughout Arab world
       as a corollary of US policy in intervening by military means to assist Lebanon to maintain
       its integrity and independence. This likewise should have considerable political impact
       beyond borders of Lebanon. Fact Moslem Karami asked for and accepted such aid would silence
       usual output of Cairo and Moscow radios.</p>
      <p>What we are in effect asking for is a one-shot non-repeating aid operation made for
       political considerations but with sound long-term economic justification. This will cost ten
       million dollars and will not recur. After that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> operation
       Lebanon will be principally confined to winding up past pipeline business, reallocating and
       reducing past project commitments and to responding to anticipated requests by <gloss
        target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> for intelligent technical assistance or <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
        >DLF</gloss> aid. What we are trying to do in effect is to turn a completely new page in
       history of our aid for Lebanon and to start a new year in 1959 which is definitely a new
       year. I trust Department and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>–W will concur in this
       recommendation <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0664"/>(which has approval of Country Team)
       and that affirmative instructions will be issued forthwith.<note n="6" xml:id="d366fn6">In

        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and this morning with Karami. I likewise outlined main
       points US offer to Foreign Minister Oueini today. During interview with Karami which lasted
       hour and a half he was accompanied (at my private suggestion) by Raymond Edde, while I had
       with me acting <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director Lippincott. To make certain
       Karami understood everything that was said, conversation was translated from English into
       Arabic by Embassy employee <persName corresp="#p_HF3">Haddad</persName>.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> evinced utmost gratification at readiness of
       US to offer $10, 000,000 as one-time grant operation and concurred that with other elements
       of US aid program there should be no requirement for any repetition of such a cash grant. He
       agreed that Lebanon must find sufficient civic and administrative discipline to live within
       its own resources and to go its own way. I found a similar but more attenuated concurrence in
       Karami and Edde who said that, although they agreed in principle that Lebanon should meet its
       own fiscal requirements, they could not say with certainty that <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
        >GOL</gloss> would not in future years require some form of external assistance. However,
       their eyes were clearly on finding means to finance larger budgets and to this I rejoined
       that until Lebanese imposed same sacrifice on their citizens as did US in respect of income
       tax I, for one, could not go along with notion that ever increasing budgets would somehow be
       underwritten by a complacent Uncle Sam.</p>

       he explained that during Parliamentary debate on grant of emergency powers to Government, he
       had been pressed to give assurances that these powers would not include authorization to
       cabinet to contract debts on behalf of Lebanon. It was to this parliamentary restriction that
       his press conference statement had been addressed. However, he would welcome in principle
       utilization of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> financing in private sector provided
       applications for loans could be processed expeditiously and if rate of interest was not too
       high. (We have feeling, however, that in a hard currency country like Lebanon there will be
       less enthusiasm than in soft currency countries for loans to private sector at interest rates
       of between four and one half to five and one half percent.) It was clear that Prime Minister
       was apprehensive lest announcement of availability of $12, 000,000 of <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
        >DLF</gloss> funds might unleash a clamor from undisciplined applicants which might have
       unfavorable repercussions for his Government in event many claimants for easy loans would of
       necessity be turned down. Karami asked if in screening out applications for loans we would
       object to an informal working group made up of representatives of Lebanese interested
       Ministries and of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. I replied I had no objection as, in
       fact, I had told <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> last night I did not wish US
       to be in a position of being deluged with requests for soft loans which it was not purpose of
        <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> to finance and would in consequence welcome an
       indigenous shock absorber between <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and voracious
       applicants for easy loan financing.</p>
      <p>Karami and Edde fully understood need for cleaning up arrears of pipeline and will appoint
       experts to consult with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> on details.</p>
      <p>Re final paragraph <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1990, Karami was in full
       agreement with suggested treatment. He volunteered that he would like to make a statement at
       his weekly press conference tomorrow. I had anticipated this and had drafted as a talking
       paper a suggested communiqué which he might wish to issue. Karami thought it would prove a
       good vehicle for his press conference statement. Text is submitted to Department in <gloss

      <p>Although foregoing were dominant themes, it was reassuring to find many responsible
       Lebanese leaders were fully conscious of overriding threat of <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> and aggressive Communism to safety of the free countries of <gloss
        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. This was most clearly manifest by President <persName
        corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>; significantly alluded to by Prime Minister Karami and
       was subject of a personal peroration by Foreign Minister Oueini in a private audience <pb
        n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0667"/>he insisted on according Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> and me today. Foreign Minister, with every
       appearance of complete sincerity, said Russia was ultimate enemy in <gloss target="#t_ME1"
        >ME</gloss> and thus far <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had succeeded in capitalizing
       on mistakes made by “US”—in which he referred not only to US and Western world but to Arab
       states also. Oueini said unless some stop was put to onward march of Communism future of
        <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> would be synonymous with disaster for people who live
       there. He thought way out included better relations between ourselves and <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and, above all, prompt action spurred by US on some
       settlement of refugee problem, his own somewhat oversimplified solution would be for US to
       issue a unilateral declaration to effect best remedy for refugee issue would be for refugees
       to return to their former homes within one year’s time. He said this would be a great
       psychological shock in this part of the world (as indeed it would be) but that as a matter of
       fact, by his own estimate, 99 percent of refugees would not opt to return to Palestine. It
       would then be incumbent on US, in consultation with Israel, to work out financial means for
       permanent resettlement and rehabilitation of refugees. I replied that this remedy had
       advantage of simplicity, but that there were many facets of refugee problem, to say nothing
       of need to choose optimum moment, both with Israel and Arab governments, to push for a truly
       final settlement of this matter.</p>
      <p>It was noteworthy that in all our conversations no Lebanese official made any request for
       additional US financial aid.</p>
      <p>While papers today carried a statement by Karami that, although he had not discussed
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine with us, it was to all intents
       and purposes a dead letter, here again no Minister raised issue of <persName
        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine. However, following press accounts
       attributed to Karami, I did take pains to explain to certain Ministers on my own volition
       unilateral character of Congressional resolution on <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and its
       implications in respect of foreign policy in this area.</p>
      <p>My over-all impression of Lebanese visit is that in a remarkably short space of time
       Lebanese, under an energetic and streamlined government, are rapidly returning toward a more
       normal life handicapped only by fact that under directed economies of such important
       neighboring states as Syria and Iraq their usual lucrative transit trade has not been
       re-established. In general, in Karami Cabinet and elsewhere, there seems to be a warm regard
       and respect for US, as well as an appreciation of the fact (an appreciation ranging from
       grudging acknowledgment to enthusiastic acclaim) that our military intervention here
       constructively changed course of events in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> last summer and
       prevented a chain reaction which would have become a debacle.</p>

        difficulties with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and Kassem. <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> felt that the West would make a mistake to think that
         <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s difficulties would make him more amenable
        to Western influence. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 661.86B/3–1959)</note> regarding
       present position of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his relationships with
       Western world and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>President said he thought psychological moment would presently appear when West could do a
       great deal in its own interest in improving relationships with Arab world by some gesture of
       support for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> thought that if, when as he seemed to expect <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>–Iraq relationships quieted down, some sign of support for <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and Arab world in general could be coming from West,
       this would serve to consolidate anti-Communist position which <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> has taken. Whether we like it or not <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> was acknowledged leader of Arab world but as a dictator he could do
       irresponsible things if pushed too far. In consequence a policy of “seeing him on his knees,”
       which seemed to motivate Turks, Israelis and possibly British, could only provoke him to
       further excess. At same time, said <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, Russian
       bear was an animal “in the face of which one can spit and he will wipe it off and forget the
       episode provided it is to his interest.” He cautioned that it was by no means impossible for
        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to reach rapid accommodation with <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> if that suited Soviet policy.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> did not specify what sort of gesture from
       West would be most suitable at a psychological moment yet to be realized but he did say it
       should be something which would have impact throughout Arab world at same time “not be too
       much.” At this juncture he hastily added, “we should not put <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> on a pedestal; after all I am a Lebanese”.</p>
      <p>Asked as to rumors of possible mediation between Iraq and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> by Lebanon, President said three of more nearly neutral countries of Arab
       League had been mentioned in this connection. In addition to Lebanon there was the Sudan,
       which had originally broached idea, and Morocco—however, President said, there could be no
       successful mediation unless both parties were amenable thereto; and thus far there had been
       no indication that Iraq would welcome outside intervention even from most impartial of Arab
       League members.</p>
      <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0670"/>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I do not know what sort of gesture from West and

        >Nasser</persName>, would be most effective but would leave this problem to judgment of my
       colleagues in Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad. I do feel however that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"

       situation in Arab world is sound one.</p>

        <p>“The United States Development Loan Fund today announced basic approval and commitment of
         funds for a $5, 000,000 loan to the Banque de Credit Agricole, Industriel et Foncier
         (BCAIF), a private Lebanese development bank with 40 percent government participation

         expansion of existing agricultural, real-estate, and industrial enterprises. Commercial
         credit is about the only form available in Beirut, and the establishment of new industries
         has been hampered for want of long-term credit. Proceeds of the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"

      <p>Prime Minister Karami and Ambassador Abou Khater called on the Secretary at their request
       for a preliminary exchange of views prior to their visit to Washington.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d372fn2">Karame came to New York as head of the Lebanese Delegation and served as
        President Pro Tern of the General Assembly in place of <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Charles
         Malik</persName> at the opening session on September 16. He visited Washington at his
        request September 21–22 to meet with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName>.</note></p>
      <p>Karami was primarily concerned with the drop in U.S. economic aid following the change in
       government in Lebanon.<note n="3" xml:id="d372fn3">Karame became Prime Minister and head of a
        four-man cabinet serving under President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> on
        October 15, 1958.</note> He said the people of the Middle East believe in the same
       principles as the Western world. They could never espouse Communism because this is totally
       contrary to their religious beliefs. However he claimed the U.S. economic policy in this area
       was geared to maintaining friendly governments in power and once this was achieved the U.S.
       stopped economic aid.</p>
      <p>Because of this fact and because the U.S. was still linked to the U.K. in the minds of the
       people in the Middle East, most of the national revolts which had taken place in the Middle
       East had necessarily <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0672"/>been forced to join with
       Communist elements to achieve success, although they would have preferred to achieve their
       goals without their help and with the tacit support of the U.S. The Baghdad Pact and the
        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Doctrine had been premature and a further
       element in forcing nationalists in such countries as Iraq and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> from adopting tactics they would not necessarily have preferred to adopt.</p>
      <p>Karami agreed with the Secretary’s answer that very often the Communists take advantage of
       proper nationalist aspirations for their own ends and we ourselves had been deluded by what
       had originally appeared as an agrarian revolt in China but which had proved to be a ruthless
       Communist coup. However Karami said that public opinion in the area was still convinced that
       U.S. military and economic aid was geared to U.S. political interests in the Middle East. He
       did admit that since Suez there had been a slight change in their attitude and we were not
       quite as linked with the U.K. as we had been in the past.</p>
      <p>The Secretary concluded by saying that the U.S. only attached certain conditions to
       military aid but never to economic aid and that economic aid had consistently been used for
       the benefit of improving economic conditions in these countries and not for political
       purposes. While it was true that economic aid to Lebanon had diminished, this was due to
       certain conditions beyond our control and based on limitations imposed by existing aid
       legislation. We had confidence in the present Lebanese Government and we have never used, nor
       do we intend to use, economic aid for political purposes.</p>

      <p>What had been expected to be a brief courtesy call by Prime Minister Karame on the
       President developed into a lively but very friendly exchange of views lasting one hour and
       five minutes covering matters of primary concern to both the Arab world and the United
       States.</p>
      <p>After expressing his appreciation for Prime Minister Karame’s call and his happiness in
       having this opportunity to meet him, the President inquired as to the length of time the
       Prime Minister would remain in the United States. Mr. <persName>Karame</persName> replied
       that he had expected to be here until the end of September, indicating his intention to visit
       Detroit and to spend some time at the United Nations General Assembly. The President inquired
       whether Lebanon had particular problems to raise at the present General Assembly, commenting
       that the United States for its part would be glad to see progress on the problem of the Arab
       refugees and that he personally had very much in mind the question of Algeria, on which
       General DeGaulle had just taken a most important step. (The President later stated that he
       had not meant to imply that General DeGaulle’s proposals should be discussed in the <gloss
        target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.) Prime Minister Karame asked to respond in Arabic, using
       Ambassador Dimechkié as interpreter. He began by extensive comments on the values held in
       common by the Arabs and the West and the great confidence which the Arab peoples felt for
       President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.</p>
      <p>The subsequent conversation is recorded by subject headings rather than by strict
       chronology.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Arab Nationalism and Communism</hi>. Emphasizing the values held in
       common between America and the Arab world, the Prime Minister urged that America avoid
       mistaking true Arab Nationalism from the false Nationalism voiced by Communists. For example,
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, while fighting Imperialism, was mistakenly
       charged by the West as a Communist, or a follower of Communism. We now see that when his main
       battle against Imperialism had finished, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> did
       not hesitate to turn against the Communists, and to combat them as fiercely as he had the
       Imperialists, Prime Minister Karame regretted that Western antagonism toward <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> befogged Western appreciation of <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s position today. He cited the Iraqi situation as prime
       evidence. He could not understand why the United Kingdom continued to consider <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> a greater threat than the Communists in Iraq.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Palestine Arab Refugees</hi>. The President referred to his concern that
       the situation of the Arab refugees, which he characterized as an “international disgrace”, be
       tackled more effectively, and noted that the United States had been paying 70 per cent of the
       bills of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. He felt that continuation of this situation
       was not satisfactory and did nothing to advance a solution. Prime Minister Karame responded
       that the 1947 Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly defined <pb n="642"
        xml:id="pg_642" facs="0674"/>the rights of the refugees but had not been carried out. The
       avenue to a solution lay in pressuring the Israelis to accept these Resolutions, not in
       forfeiting the rights of the refugees. The Palestine Conciliation Commission had been set up
       to care for the property rights of the refugees and should be permitted to operate within
       Israel, collect the money due the refugees thus relieving them from the indignity of taking
       charity.</p>
      <p>On the Palestine situation in general, the President commented that he had suspected in
       1956 that the Arabs believed the United States approached the Palestine problem only from the
       standpoint of national elections in the United States, and the influence which proponents of
       Israel might exert in those elections. He had therefore made special efforts by a series of
       actions to disabuse everyone thoroughly of this concept. Logically, as a result of such
       efforts, he, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, should have been
       defeated in the 1956 elections. From a purely material point of view the United States had
       much more to gain by close association with the Arabs than with Israelis. Arab territory was
       vast while Israel’s was small; the Arabs had tremendous oil reserves which the West badly
       needed, while Israel had none. Nevertheless, he felt that the Arabs would agree that we
       should deal with this question on the basis of principle. He would be happy if some steps
       could be taken to relieve the tension. Several measures had been proposed in the past, among
       others he had sent Eric Johnston to the area to obtain an Arab-Israel solution to the
       distribution of Jordan Waters. Technical agreement had been reached but political obstacles
       vitiated the solution. Both sides are intransigent as a result of deep emotional feelings
       which he felt he well understood. However, Israel was now a historic fact, created well
       before President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had assumed office. It
       should be accepted as such. He certainly did not favor Israel over other countries, neither
       did he wish to destroy it. Perhaps the creation of any state on the basis of religion alone
       was a mistake. We all live under one God. Yet religious antagonisms make us overlook the main
       threat today which is the anti-religious, atheistic force of Communism. As between Zionism
       and Communism, the greater threat to the Arab world was surely Communism. Ambassador
       Dimechkié laughingly responded that he wished the President would not force the Arabs to
       choose between these two antagonists, as they would more likely pick the Zionists as the
       deadlier enemy. The President disagreed and in one of his last comments to Prime Minister
       Karame at the end of the interview, he urged him again not to lose sight of the fact that the
       main enemy to Arabs, as to the rest of the Western world, was International Communism.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Karame responded that ultimately the Palestine problem would somehow have to
       be solved. While he agreed with the President’s remark that no ready solution was in sight,
       some day a <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0675"/>solution would be found as it had been
       found for Cyprus. In the end, the best thing for the United States would be to remain neutral
       in this question. Some day the Arabs and the Israelis would have to sit down together and
       work it out between them.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Algeria</hi>. Responding to the President’s statement that he was very
       well impressed by DeGaulle’s proposals, Prime Minister Karame said he wished to speak to
       President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> as a soldier. As such he could
       understand that the Algerians who had fought for five years against great odds for their
       independence and were willing to continue fighting for it must examine with great care any
       proposals from the other side, even those which for the first time spoke of independence. The
       question was how the Algerian people were to express themselves on the question of
       independence. He urged that the United States not take a formal stand on the DeGaulle
       proposals until they had been fully examined by the Arabs. Such examination was now under way
       and it would facilitate matters and would most likely lead toward a settlement if public
       positions were not frozen in advance. The President indicated that he had no intention of
       making a public statement.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Arab Self Help</hi>. At one point, the President indicated that in 1958
       he had expressed a readiness to assist the Arabs in any joint effort they might devise to
       improve their economic lot and their stability. That was the American way: To give help to
       those who vigorously help themselves. He would never be interested in a country which did not
       bend its whole heart and soul toward improving its own lot. He would like to inquire what the
       Arab reaction was today to these 1958 proposals that they pool their efforts toward a common
       goal. Prime Minister Karame replied that steps were being taken, such as the Arab Bank and
       the Joint Fund and there had been some talk of inter-Arab roadways; but progress on joint
       projects had been very slow. The most logical projects to Arabs were those within the borders
       of the independent Arab states and which redounded to the immediate benefit of the individual
       Arab communities, for example, the Aswan Dam and the Litani projects. However, joint
       undertakings would come with time.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">American Landings in Lebanon in 1958</hi>. The President referred to our
       landings in Lebanon at the request of its elected government as an example of United States
       willingness to assist small nations preserve their integrity in the face of outside
       intervention. The Prime Minister responded: “It would have been better for you just to have
       sent us Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>”. (laughter)</p>
      <p>In closing the interview, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
       indicated that the press was anxious to take pictures of Prime Minister Karame and himself.
       If the Prime Minister had no objection he would invite the photographers in. Prime Minister
       Karame indicated that he would be honored, and some 20 photographers were admitted.</p>

      <p>After the usual courtesies and some minutes of general conversation, Prime Minister Karame
       set forth his case for further United States assistance to Lebanon. He said he wanted to
       bring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>’s attention the fact that the
       people of Lebanon were very sensitive to the attitude of America toward them and their
       problems. Although it was true that Lebanon’s economy had recovered considerably from last
       year’s civil disturbances, all was not well in the country. Many villages did not have
       adequate water supplies, health centers, electricity, access roads, etc. His Government was
       doing what it could to develop Lebanon, but its resources were limited. He had thought that
       PL 480 might be the route by which the United States could assist. However, there were other
       ways in which the United States might help. He mentioned the United States grant aid made
       available to his Government just after its formation and suggested that we might continue
       such assistance. During his presentation, the Prime Minister also noted (1) the recent
       transit payments agreement with the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and the upcoming
       negotiations with TAPLINE in terms of new resources for his Government’s development program;
       and (2) President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statements regarding
       the world-wide need for economic development.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Dimechkie pointed up the President’s contingency fund as a possible source for
       grant assistance to Lebanon. He also took the position that Title II PL 480 aid could be
       justified on the grounds that Lebanon was faced with a balance of payments crisis. To justify
       this he cited the large trade gap. (This subject was not pursued to the point where it would
       have become clear that income for invisibles and capital account were more than balancing the
       trade deficit, thus resulting in a relatively sound foreign exchange position.)</p>
      <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0677"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> said that, given the Congressional cuts
       in the foreign aid program and world-wide demands on these funds, there was no chance of any
       grant economic aid being available for Lebanon this fiscal year. As for PL 480 assistance,
       Lebanon’s economic and financial situation made it very difficult to justify a program under
       the legislation and regulations governing either Title I or II.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: After the conversation was completed, Mr.
        <persName>Boulos</persName> approached Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName>
       pointing out that this was the Prime Minister’s first visit to the Untied States, and it was
       important politically that he not go home empty-handed. The amount of United States
       assistance was less important than the fact that he obtained something. Any gesture by the
       United States would be considered by the Prime Minister as symbolic of our good will towards
       him and his Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName> replied that we
       might be able to consider something along these lines if Mr. <persName>Boulos</persName> and
       the Prime Minister could come up with a specific case which met United States legal
       requirements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>, after being apprised of this
       talk by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Jones</persName>, agreed that if a specific case
       could be developed it might be well to consider such a gesture.</p>

        had been given to the case he made with officials in Washington on the need for continuing
        U.S. aid for Lebanon. He was particularly concerned about the situation created by the wheat
        crop failure in Lebanon and asked <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> to
        consult with the Minister of Agriculture. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

       probably approach issue of further US aid.</p>
      <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0678"/>
      <p>Most vociferous of the Ministers and at same time most generalized in his thinking was
       Foreign Minister Oueini, who made a strong plea for continued technical assistance, for PL
       480 wheat, and for certain unspecified items of grant aid which would indirectly bear on
        <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> projects for increasing productivity and raising
       standard of living. However, Haj Hussein has, through illness, been largely out of touch with
       other members of cabinet, and among his colleagues I found a much more realistic and
       restrained evaluation of future possibilities in field of US assistance. No one, including
       President, Prime Minister, Minister of Public Works, Minister of National Economy and
       Minister of Agriculture seemed to expect very much, although they had an almost pathetic and
       certainly to me alarming assumption that I could somehow manage to produce a few more white
       rabbits out of the shrinking Washington hat. In general, however, I found a philosophical
       acceptance of fact there will be no grant aid from US except possibly in realm of military
       hardware; and a cautious hope that through PL 480 Lebanon’s actual and very serious deficit
       in wheat could partially be met while at same time funds from sale of PL 480 wheat could be
       put to work in depressed sectors of population and economy. Ministers with technical
       departments, e.g., Public Works, Agriculture and Economic Affairs, likewise expressed
       interest in technical assistance as for example in engineers from Bureau of Public Roads,
       experts in agriculture, and aid in developing a sensible program for tourism.</p>
      <p>In consequence, I think we are off to a fairly good start, and that there will be no major
       disappointment either in public opinion or in more informed government circles if US aid in
       future to Lebanon is modest in proportion and eclectic in application. However, I have strong
       recommendations to offer on four main points: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Once painstaking and objective study of wheat problem has been made by Minister of
         Agriculture, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/L and Embassy economic section, every
         effort be made to provide some form of PL 480 wheat assistance. Our concrete specifications
         under this head should be forthcoming next week, if necessary studies can be completed in
         time.</item>

          target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>If as I hope Lebanese Government initiates a campaign for reducing trade barriers in
         Arab World (and I should not be surprised after my conversation this morning with Minister
         of Economic Affairs Takla that President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>
         himself may make a statement along these lines November 22), that from a very high quarter
         in U.S. Government there be sympathetic support for such a Lebanese initiative. I have
         recalled to various Ministers that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
          >Eisenhower</persName> in his <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0679"/>talk with Karame
         September 21<note n="6" xml:id="d375fn6">See <ref target="#d373">Document 373</ref>.</note>
         adverted to his speech of August 13, 1958,<note n="7" xml:id="d375fn7">See <ref
           target="#d269">Document 269</ref>.</note> and had inquired what was Arab reaction to
         these proposals that they pool their efforts toward a common goal. On November 1 in a local
         TV broadcast, but without referring to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName>–Karame conversation, in response to a question as to what I thought
         as to steps trending toward Arab unity, I cited President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
          >Eisenhower</persName>’s 6-point program of 19587 and expressed surprise that apparently
         no Arab government had responded to this generous initiative. If now, as I hope, <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> does say something about need of greater economic
         cooperation among Arab governments, it would seem appropriate for perhaps White House or
         Secretary of State to say that we, too, feel as a matter of policy (e.g., <persName
          corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s recent speech at <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
          >GATT</gloss>) that measures toward reducing trade and transit barriers by Arab
         governments are in accord, not only with U.S. views, but are a reflection of a major world
         trend toward reduction of trade barriers.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Coming now literally to “Point Four,” as indicated in my talks with ministers they are
         anxious that our Point Four operation for providing technical services and expertise be
         continued. I would say that with present government, especially with such technically
         qualified Ministers as those now in Agriculture, Education and Economic Affairs, we are in
         fortunate position of being able to control such requests as may be made with a view to
         optimum use of such skills and advice as <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/L with
          <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/Washington support can offer. Accordingly, I should
         like to have authorization to respond sympathetically to such requests for technical aid as
         may be forthcoming.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Of course we have made no commitments locally with respect to any of four foregoing
       recommendations, but I feel that such a program, if met affirmatively from Washington, would
       go far to put our aid relationships with Lebanon on a modest but sound basis. Certainly we
       have come a long way from <persName corresp="#p_MC9">Malik</persName>’s aerial promises of
       “unlimited, unconditional U.S. aid.”</p>

      <p>2947. Department pass Defense. This morning President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> made a direct personal appeal for affirmative action on Lebanon’s
       long-standing request for a modest amount of military aid.</p>
      <p>Country team telegrams are too numerous to cite but briefly a seven-man survey team from US
       Army European Command arrived here May 8 last year and completed its survey June 17,
       estimating what Lebanese Army actually needed for spare parts, ammunition and vehicles which
       ARMA valued at $2, 300,000. Subsequently country team refined this figure to a recommendation
       that hardware and an item of training for Lebanese officers in European Theater of US be
       furnished in a total amount of $1, 440,000. This figure was later reduced by country team to
       an ultimate bedrock request for $900, 000 including training.</p>
      <p>Thus, for not quite a year Lebanese Army and President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> have been hoping that as result of ordnance team survey and country team
       recommendations some modest military assistance for Lebanon would win approval in a
       Presidential determination. Of course we have not divulged any figures to Lebanese.</p>
      <p>This morning President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, in discussing
       political situation which country confronts when nation-wide parliamentary elections are held
       in May, said “In such a country as this with so many different factions and basic problem of
       Moslem-Christian differences, Army is real ultimate guarantor of independence of this
       republic.”</p>
      <p>While President did not wish speeding of munitions, spare parts and vehicles to assist
       Lebanese Army in maintaining internal security for elections, he did make valid point that
       morale of armed forces would be very much improved if they knew there were some aid
       forthcoming from US.</p>
      <p>President said that last week he had once more requested Chief of Staff to inquire as to
       possibility of securing US radar (cf. <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>s 2661 and
       2721). He said he would welcome a training mission to assist Lebanese in learning to operate
       this equipment as well as training of younger officers in US.</p>
      <p>President emphasized defensive character not only of radar installations but of whole
       philosophy of his army. As reported in a separate telegram, he once more repeated what he had
       told me two weeks ago that, in event of an Arab-Israeli war, Lebanon would not
       participate.</p>
      <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0681"/>
      <p>Service attachés and country team concur in this message. With all respect, but with
       measured insistence, we request a favorable Presidential determination.</p>

      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>It will soon be two years since virtual civil war, threatening the integrity of
        Lebanon, led to the Lebanese request for US military intervention. The period since the end
        of Chamoun’s administration has been relatively tranquil. Under President <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Prime Minister Karami, Lebanese foreign policy has
        taken a middle direction, avoiding both the outspokenly pro-West course followed by
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, and the strong pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1"
         >UAR</gloss> tendencies exhibited by Chamoun’s more ardent opponents at the time of the
        1958 troubles. In general, we consider that the present regime’s orientation reflects the
        preference of most Lebanese. There is little desire for a recurrence of the violent
        outbreaks of 1958, and most factions, since the restoration of order, have accepted a kind
        of political truce under a cabinet of moderates who have largely avoided provocative
        issues.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>This tone has been set by President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>,
        former commander of the armed forces. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> has so
        far employed a combination of compromise and firmness in his determination to avoid a
        repetition of the 1958 strife. He has shown himself willing to use force <pb n="650"
         xml:id="pg_650" facs="0682"/>against occasional threats to public security, and has
        successfully employed pressure against both Christian and Moslem political factions when he
        considered it necessary. As a Christian, he favors the system of confessional balance<note
         n="2" xml:id="d377fn2">The complex system by which the various Lebanese religious groups
         are apportioned representation in the government. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> in
        the Lebanese Government. However, he is unsympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName>, whom he regards as a dangerous extremist. He clearly hopes to prevent
        a resurgence of <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>’s political power, in part by
        bringing about a larger and more balanced representation in parliament of the various
        Lebanese factions than that resulting from the 1957 elections, which <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> rigged. Prime Minister Karami, a leader of the
         pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Moslem faction in 1958, has gone along with
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s policies, and substantial cooperation
        between them is likely to continue. Karami has removed many <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> sympathizers from the government—including the gendarmérie and
        police—but he has avoided replacing them with Moslem extremists. He, like <persName
         corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>, has sought to avoid identification with any one Arab
        regional faction.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>The basic internal rivalries between Lebanese political forces remain, of course,
        essentially unchanged. The central issue of Moslem-Druze-Christian tensions is inevitably
        coming to the fore with the approach of elections, planned for this June. <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>, in particular, feels that he and his followers are
        threatened, and that a combination of outside pressures from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
         >UAR</gloss>, together with <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s maneuverings,
        will destroy his political power. There is considerable apprehension, not only among
        Christians, that the next parliament will be dominated by Moslem extremists bent on
        destroying the delicate balance of the confessional system. Many Christian politicians fear
        that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> influence and money, chiefly originating in Syria,
        will be used to bring this about, with the aim of controlling Lebanon if not actually
        absorbing it. They insist that strong Western support is needed to enable their forces to
        rally and to counter the trend. Many Moslem and Druze elements, on the other hand, take
        Western support of the Christians for granted and seek <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
        assistance to counter it.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>While there is already evidence of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> interference in
        pre-election maneuvering, we doubt that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Government
        is intent on a massive campaign of intervention or that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName> presently entertains serious ambitions of absorbing Lebanon or
        establishing <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> hegemony there. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName> clearly wants a Lebanese government sympathetic to the <gloss
         target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the broad aims of Pan-Arab nationalism, and is prepared to
        contribute money and influence to this end. He almost certainly believes that the Western
        Powers will provide support for pro-West Lebanese factions. If he came to believe that
        outside forces were attempting to foster a Lebanese government which would follow <pb
         n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0683"/>the strongly anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName> policies <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> pursued, <gloss
         target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> counterefforts would be stepped up strongly. On the whole,
        however, we think it likely that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s actions
        will stop well short of the kind of blatant interference which characterized <gloss
         target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> activities against <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> two years ago. Syrian Region Interior Minister <persName
         corresp="#p_SAH2">Sarraj</persName> may try to interfere on a scale and by means not
        sanctioned by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but we believe that <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can probably control <persName corresp="#p_SAH2"
         >Sarraj</persName>’s activity.</item>
       <label>5.</label>
       <item>We base this estimate on the belief that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
        himself is fully alive to the unique conditions governing Lebanese affairs. Lebanese
        policies under <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Karami have been
        essentially satisfactory to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is aware of Western interest in Lebanon’s continued
        independence and is not desirous of adding to his troubles with the Western Powers—at least
        with the US—at a time when he is heavily engaged with his own problems. He probably believes
        that the Western Powers under certain circumstances would again intervene in Lebanon.
        Moreover, he has been impressed with the difficulties of governing Syria, and is aware that
        Lebanon’s peculiar domestic institutions and international position would present even
        thornier problems if he tried to take them on.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>Nor do we believe that any substantial Lebanese faction seriously wants the state to be
        joined with or subservient to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. Certainly President
         <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Prime Minister Karami have shown little
        of the extreme pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> sentiments which some of Karami’s
        fellow-dissidents displayed when they were in arms against <persName corresp="#p_CC7"
         >Chamoun</persName> two years ago. The moderate Moslem factions, which were prompted to
        turn to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> as the only available support against
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> in 1957 and 1958, now feel reasonably secure
        under <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> and Karami. Having seriously weakened
         <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> and strengthened the Moslem position, Karami
        and his sympathizers give every indication of wanting to consolidate these gains, but to do
        so far short of following the Syrian politicians into dependence on <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>They will find support in this course from Arab leaders other than <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. King <persName corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName>, once
        a heavy financial contributor to various Lebanese political factions, no longer has the
        funds for such purposes. However, such influence as he and his family retain will be exerted
        against the spread of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s influence. The Iraqis,
        Jordanians, Iranians, and Turks will also back candidates opposed to <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. On the whole, these attempts are not likely materially
        to affect the outcome of the elections.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>Neither the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> nor France is likely to be as active as
        in the past. Both will probably attempt to hold pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
        influences to a minimum, through covert support of certain Christian and moderate Moslem
        elements, but they will probably avoid, as unfeasible, attempts to bring about the kind of
        clear pro-Western orientation which British and French influence fostered in previous
        Lebanese governments.</item>
       <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0684"/>
       <label>9.</label>
       <item>As the elections approach and tensions mount, interested outside powers are likely to
        become more deeply involved than they may now plan. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName> will be under pressure from pro-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
        elements for greater support, and he will find it difficult to reject these demands even if
        he were so inclined. The Western Powers will encounter growing importunities from pro-West
        elements to take more vigorous action.</item>
       <label>10.</label>
       <item>In any case, the elections will be hard fought, with considerable risks of serious
        clashes. On the whole, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName>’s
        control of the security forces is strong enough to enable him to cope with the kind of
        localized armed clashes which are a normal feature of Lebanese elections. This is
        particularly true since the elections will be held on four successive Sundays in different
        parts of the country, thus enabling the security forces to be moved around. A more serious
        danger is that disorders might become widespread. Further incidents such as the May bombings
        in Beirut, for example, unless decisively dealt with by <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName>, might cause both Christians and Moslems to drop their present internal
        differences and close ranks against each other.<note n="3" xml:id="d377fn3">The
         Christian-Moslem rivalry in Lebanon is complicated by the sectarian and factional
         differences within each community. The Sunni-Shia split tends to inhibit effective Moslem
         unity, while the Christian camp is divided into various sects, with Maronites in the
         majority, followed by Greek Orthodox and various others. The Druzes constitute a distinct
         but influential third element. Normally, these internal differences equal or even
         overshadow the simple distinction between Christians and Moslems. [Footnote in the source
         text.]</note> Such a development would divide government and country alike and place
        critical strains on the unity and discipline of the security forces. As a last resort the
        government might feel compelled to postpone the elections, but this now appears
        unlikely.</item>
       <label>11.</label>
       <item>The elections are likely to result in a parliament more accommodating to <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and his policies than the recent one. In an effort to
        bring all political factions into the new parliament and discourage extra-parliamentary
        maneuvering by disgruntled “outs,” 33 new seats are to be added to the parliament, now
        composed of 66 members. In accordance with custom, confessional representation is to remain
        in about the same proportion. However, most of the new seats will probably be won by
        politicians unsympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName>. Finally, many
        present pro-<persName corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> deputies will probably encounter
        much stiffer opposition in their own districts.</item>
       <label>12.</label>
       <item>We do not, however, believe that extremist Moslems are likely to gain sufficient
        strength in parliament to attempt drastic changes in Lebanon’s present middle of the road
        foreign policy or to upset the present confessional balance. Any such effort would be
        opposed not only by the Christians, but also by many moderate Sunnis, most Shias, and the
        Druzes. An additional measure of protection is afforded the <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653"
         facs="0685"/>Christians by virtue of the fact that President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName>’s term of office has four more years to run. <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
         >Chehab</persName> will probably attempt to prevent any Moslem extremism in
        parliament.</item>
       <label>13.</label>
       <item>Long-term trends in Lebanon clearly favor some increase in Moslem influence and greater
        identification with Arab nationalism in general. Outspoken pro-Westernism of the <persName
         corresp="#p_CC7">Chamoun</persName> brand is highly unlikely to be adopted again, and no
        foreseeable Lebanese government would have much chance of surviving if it tried to restore
        that orientation. Nonetheless, it remains unlikely that Moslem influence will lead, even in
        the longer run, to unification of Lebanon with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> or
        the effective suppression of pro-West or Christian elements. For the foreseeable future most
        Lebanese, Christian and non-Christians alike, would have too much to lose by such a
        development.</item>

       surveillance radar set-up against high flying Israeli reconnaissance planes. (I received
       impression from him Syrian pressure on this matter is continuing.) I assured him grant
       included the radar equipment recommended by our country team following his conversations on
       subject with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName> several months
       ago. (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2721, March 1)<note n="3" xml:id="d378fn3">In

      <p>President was philosophical over my point that this was one-time grant considered

       internal security purposes and that henceforth <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> should
       look to 1953 Reimbursable Aid Agreement for any further military assistance. President said

       and hoped that things had gone well in Lebanon since then.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said things had indeed developed well in Lebanon. General elections had
       been held and foreign elements of the Lebanese political body have been fused satisfactorily
       into the government. Lebanon still has many refugees from Palestine who are desirous of

       main sore point for the Arabs.</p>
      <p>The President expressed regret over the condition of Arab refugees. He said our people had
       been reluctant to press the refugee problem because it is difficult to see prospects for real
       rapid improvement. The Prime Minister said they favor dealing with this problem through the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He pointed out that some <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> resolutions have not yet been implemented. He said the refugee elements become
       more explosive every day as they grow in numbers of people and in strength of arms.</p>
      <p>The President said he is encouraging all nations with refugees to build their industries
       proportionately. He referred to the situation in Japan, which, with 95 million people,
       possesses so little arable ground (less than California) that she must be industrialized. The
       Prime Minister said that Lebanon was industrializing as fast as possible. In answer to the
       President’s question, he said the refugees remain in their camps because they refuse to give
       up hope of returning to Palestine. The Lebanese Ambassador said that many refugees still
       retain the keys to their old homes.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister then referred to Algeria. He referred to the President’s September 22nd
       speech advocating self-determination of peoples. He said the Arabs interpret this reference
       as advocating freedom for Algeria. The President said the U.S. has always stood for
       self-determination for peoples, back to the days of President <persName>Wilson</persName>.
       The difficulty in Algeria is the fact of the French-European settlers. He said he thinks
        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has tried hard to bring about a peaceful
       solution to that problem, and that we could support <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
        Gaulle</persName>’s position as outlined in the speech of September 1959. The Prime Minister
       said that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is supplying words and not
       actions. Furthermore, in his use of the word “pacification,” the connotation is anything but
       pacific.</p>
      <p>The President admitted that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is not a
       simple man. The President had presumed that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
       wanted elections in Algeria soon, but <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
       pointed out the difficulty of holding elections while fighting is going on. When the Prime
       Minister referred to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the President admitted <persName
        corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s dislike of that body. The Prime Minister said that
       the main hope of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is the President’s support.</p>
      <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0688"/>
      <p>The President said that when he was in Paris last year <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
        Gaulle</persName> had offered freedom to the French Community. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
        >De Gaulle</persName> had told him, however, that the difficulty in Algeria is the fact that
       they possess no recognized spokesman. An Arab woman in the Cabinet had told the President
       that the mass of Arabs in Algeria trust <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.
        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had reemphasized that no spokesman for the
       Arabs in Algeria exists.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said the trouble is that the U.S. is not experienced as are the Lebanese
       in dealing with the French. One technique of the French is to obtain sympathizers to their
       own views and then call them representatives. The President said he had had experience with
       the Arabs in North Africa from his days in the war and had learned at that time how little he
       knew of Arab politics. For example, he had been disturbed over oppressive local laws against
       the Jews. He had given an order for repeal of these laws and had received a disturbed letter
       from a rabbi warning him that such action would bring retaliation in the form of violence
       against all Jews in Algeria. The Prime Minister added this was the same case of the woman who
       talked to the President.</p>
      <p>The President said that he gives <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> credit
       for believing what he says. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is honest,
       although he may have some blank spots in his vision. The Lebanese Ambassador asked why it
       required a half million French soldiers to combat a few non-influential rebels. The President
       said he had mentioned this to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, who had
       pointed out the fact that the bands were concentrated and were operating in difficult
       terrain. Perhaps if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had been generous in the
       beginning, he could have settled with profitable economic ties between the two nations. The
       Prime Minister brought up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> again and the President
       repeated that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is adamant on this subject.
       The Prime Minister repeated there is no other course for solution. The spirit of the world is
       like that of the Algerian rebels; freedom at all costs.</p>
      <p>The President said he should think the situation of the Algerian people would be better
       than average for Africa.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister quoted a speech by the President in his 1952 election campaign, in which
       he had allegedly said that all subject peoples must be emancipated before the world can know
       real peace. The President corrected the Prime Minister’s quotation and reminded him that he
       had insisted that peoples must be prepared to take over. This contrasts with the attitude of
       Sekou Toure who says no preparation is necessary. The President advocates going to the people
       and laying before them the opportunity for independence in the Philippines in which the
       Philippines were prepared for independence at U.S. expense. For 35 years the Philippines
       underwent constant expansion of their training in self-government. In 1935 we promised to
       free the <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0689"/>Philippines in 10 years. During that period
       of transition, the Philippines had a commonwealth government. Also during that time we
       gradually instituted tariffs but plowed under the proceeds to the further building up of the
       Philippines. Even at that, when the time came, the Philippines were woefully unprepared.
       Compared to their situation, however, other peoples are far worse off.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said the fault of this unpreparedness elsewhere is the fact that
       colonial powers have not foreseen the situation wisely. The President quoted some figures he
       had seen recently regarding the Congo. Apparently in this entire nation there are only 16
       college graduates, one doctor, and one lawyer. This was why the President had emphasized the
       matter of education in his speech that morning.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said he appreciated the educational problem. Lebanon itself is reputed
       to be a forward country in the Arab world but this forwardness is a facade only. Lebanon is
       20% developed and 80% underdeveloped, and a part of the country is highly underdeveloped.
       Lebanon has a population of 1.5 million people. It is in need of roads, doctors, water and
       schools.</p>
      <p>The President admitted the building of a nation takes time. A nation must help itself with
       the aid of others. Things like clinics, accountants, and the like, are needed. The Prime
       Minister agreed that the initiative must come from the country itself. He quoted that God
       helps those who help themselves.</p>
      <p>The President repeated that responsibility is on the nations themselves and that
       improvement takes time. The Communists, in an effort to create discontent, tell everybody
       that growth should be overnight. Our doctrine is that evident improvement, even though
       gradual, is conducive to high morale. The Prime Minister said it is difficult to
       differentiate between the Communist line and the legitimate aspirations of all subject
       peoples to throw out the <hi rend="italic">colons</hi>.</p>
      <p>The President said he could not see how any people with any religious feelings could be
       Communists. To those with any religion at all, death is better than slavery. He realizes that
       to the man in the Congo the issue is not placed in such stark terms. In our case, if the
       choice is put to the people, we will fight to the last man.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said that you cannot “sleep on” religion as proof against Communism.
       This is proved by the number of Moslems who have turned Communist. The President agreed that
       to the peasant whose goats are starving the issues are not clearcut.</p>

      </list>
      <p>During a number of brief encounters with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS4"
        >Salaam</persName> at social functions during his weekend visit to Washington, the following
       items of interest emerged in informal discussion: <list>
        <label>1.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName></hi>. <persName>Saeb
          Bey</persName> said that during an automobile ride in New York, <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
          >UAR</gloss> President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had confided to him
         that he, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, could not be unfriendly to the
         United States. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had noted
         appreciatively that his country has received over $400 million in American aid in recent
         years. (<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> obviously was impressed by statistics
         brought to his attention by Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
          >Hare</persName>.) Mr. <persName>Meyer</persName> suggested to <persName>Saeb
          Bey</persName> that he might wish to use his considerable influence on <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to persuade him to reflect a more friendly attitude
         toward the United States in his public speeches. Mr. <persName>Meyer</persName> noted that
         it is difficult for the United States Government to maintain “normalized relations” without
         some cooperation on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s part. The Prime
         Minister replied that the US should keep in mind that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
          >Nasser</persName> has in the past openly attacked the Communists and that <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can be relied on as the chief obstacle to the
         Communist offensive in the Middle East. Mr. <persName>Meyer</persName> expressed the view
         that from a long-range standpoint, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s value in
         this regard would be more effective if he could see his way clear to display less
         partiality for Soviet causes in international affairs. The Prime Minister suggested that
         the US should do its best to try to win <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
         confidence, at which point Mr. <persName>Meyer</persName> in a friendly vein referred to an
         old Arab proverb “You can’t clap with one hand”.</item>
        <label>2.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Syria</hi>. Most of the present dissatisfaction in Syria, according
         to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS4">Salaam</persName>, stems from the three years
         of drought. He did not anticipate an early break-up of the Syria-Egyptian union, although
         he observed that strong man <persName corresp="#p_SAH2">Sarraj</persName> is clearly not
         under <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s full control. He said <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> remains the hero of most Syrians.</item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>. <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> said that he could state
         with “100% plus” certainty that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had nothing
         to do with the assassination of Jordanian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Majali1"
          >Majali</persName>. He would not be able to make the same statement, he said, with respect
         to Damascus and <persName corresp="#p_SAH2">Sarraj</persName>. He <pb n="659"
          xml:id="pg_659" facs="0691"/>reported that at New York the Lebanese have endeavored with
         some success to ameliorate <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_HKJ1"
          >HKJ</gloss> tensions. He gave the impression that King Hussein was much more responsive
         than <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Alleged British Perfidy</hi>. Despite the <persName
          corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
         conversations, the contents of which he was not aware, <persName>Saeb Bey</persName>
         emphatically denounced British activities in the Middle East, including in Lebanon. Mr.
          <persName>Meyer</persName> stated just as emphatically his view that the British were
         making a sincere effort to demonstrate that they are not interfering in Arab world affairs
         and that they desire to maintain normal friendly relations with all the Arab countries.
          <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> was clearly unconvinced.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Lebanese Politics</hi>. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SS4"
          >Salaam</persName> said he suspected that President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
          >Chehab</persName> would again attempt to resign in the near future. However, all Lebanese
         would unanimously insist that he continue to serve until the expiration of his term in
         1964. <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> said there is no other alternative to <persName
          corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> as Lebanon’s President in the foreseeable future. The
         Prime Minister voiced his high regard for Nassim Majdalani, who is presently Acting Prime
         Minister. He also described his erstwhile rival for the Prime Ministership, Abdulla Yafi,
         as “finished”. He saw no chance that fanatical Moslem Adnan Hakim could ever attain the
         Prime Ministership and in this connection noted how he, <persName>Saeb Bey</persName>, had
         categorically rejected Hakim’s proposal for a census, long demanded by Lebanon’s
         Moslems.</item>
        <label>6.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Aid</hi>. <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> expressed the hope that
         Lebanon could receive US assistance. Americans, he said, quite erroneously consider Lebanon
         to be prosperous. Their views are based merely on a quick look at the building boom in
         Beirut, he said, adding that just before coming to New York he had read a report by a
         certain Pere LeBret who had concluded that Lebanon is 80% underdeveloped. In this
         connection, the Prime Minister noted that much of southern Lebanon doesn’t even have
         electricity. When Mr. <persName>Meyer</persName> suggested that perhaps this would be
         remedied when the Litani project is completed, the Prime Minister said he is fast reaching
         the conclusion that the funds invested in the Litani project would have been better placed
         in other projects. He was pleased by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
          >Herter</persName>’s interest in Lebanon’s road program. He noted that he had invited some
         Germans to undertake surveys of the road situation. Mr. <persName>Meyer</persName>
         applauded this move and encouraged the Prime Minister to see whether he might not induce
         much greater German interest in Lebanon’s development program. As for US aid, Mr.
          <persName>Meyer</persName> suggested that the only possibilities are probably PL–480 and
          <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. Both of these have been under continuing discussion
         between US and Lebanese authorities.</item>
        <label>7.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Ambassadors</hi>. <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> said he is
         considering moving Ambassador Dimechkie from Washington to Cairo to maintain close Lebanese
         contact with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> which he, <persName>Saeb
          Bey</persName>, cannot himself do for domestic <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0692"
         />political reasons. He noted Dimechkie’s intimate friendship with <persName
          corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, and suggested this transfer might also be of some
         benefit to the US. Asked as to Dimechkie’s successor in Washington, <persName>Saeb
          Bey</persName> said he had no one in particular in mind as yet and that one of his
         problems is finding qualified personnel for such assignments. The Prime Minister spoke most
         complimentarily of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCRM1">McClintock</persName>. Noting
         that he had not as yet met Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>, he
         stressed that Cairo was the most important Ambassadorial post for the US in the Near East.
         As far as <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassadors are concerned, <persName>Saeb
          Bey</persName> expressed the view, probably echoing Nasser’s sentiments, that <gloss
          target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassadors are not as well qualified as they should be. The
         implication was that the days of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador in
         Washington may be numbered.</item>
        <label>8.</label>
        <item><hi rend="italic">Semper Fidelis</hi>. <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> reported that on
         the day before coming to Washington he had received in New York a group of Marine Corps
         officers who had participated in the landings in Lebanon in 1958. As a rebel leader
         barricaded in his Basta headquarters, <persName>Saeb Bey</persName> had not been able to
         meet these American officers when they were in Lebanon. Now, on their own initiative, they
         had called on him in New York to pay their respects. <persName>Saeb Bay</persName>
         indicated the hour spent with these warm-hearted Marine officers will remain one of the
         most pleasant memories of his current sojourn in the United States.</item>

      <p rend="flushleft"><gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–96</p>
      <p>In recent weeks indications have reached members of the Country Team that the Government
       presided over by <persName>Saeb Salaam</persName>, made up in some part of Ministers who have
       never previously held portfolios, will ultimately make formal requests for U.S. economic
       assistance far exceeding any expectation cherished by interested agencies in Washington.</p>
      <p>The Country Team will in due course summarize the informal soundings already made by
       various Ministers and will make recommendations as to the attitude it feels the United States
       Government should take. In general it can be said that new Ministers, anxious to make a
       political name for themselves, are over-prone to look to Point <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661"
        facs="0693"/>IV assistance without an adequate background such as was possessed by the two
       Karame cabinets and a realization that the United States does not feel that Lebanon needs
       grant aid of the type previously furnished under the auspices of Point IV.</p>
      <p>At the same time there is a definite malaise in the country. The continuous manifestation
       of strikes for higher pay is causing serious concern to the Government and to impartial
       observers. Although certain sectors of the economy are flourishing, others are depressed. The
       cost of living has steadily risen and in many cases wages have not maintained parity with the
       increase in the price of daily bread.</p>
      <p>Fortunately President <persName corresp="#p_CGF2">Chehab</persName> is aware of the past
       measures which the United States has taken to aid Lebanon and of our very reserved view on
       the need for future assistance to Lebanon. Nevertheless political pressures will build and in
       my judgment we will receive requests for aid far in excess of our desire to respond
       affirmatively.</p>
      <p>Generally typical of this attitude was the position revealed to me this morning by the
       Acting Minister of Finance, Maurice Gemayel, who is a very sincere friend of the United
       States. <persName corresp="#p_GP4">Gemayel</persName> portrayed a dark picture of Lebanon’s
       economic future unless the Government should embark upon a new rationale involving
       nation-wide reform of the entire economy. He also intended to use Professor Higgins’s report
       as the basis for an extensive program of fiscal reform and said he would call upon Higgins to
       return to Lebanon to draft the necessary legislation.</p>
      <p>The Acting Minister of Finance showed me charts indicating past and projected future
       revenues and expenditures. It was clear that he was attempting a scientific approach to the
       problems confronting the Ministry of Finance; but whether he would find the financial means
       to make possible the carrying out of the reform program seemed much in doubt. The Minister
       spoke of asking for American assistance both in the field of low interest, long term loans
       and cash grant aid, but was unable to estimate amounts under either heading.</p>
      <p>I told Maurice Gemayel, as I had previously remarked last week to the Minister of Planning,
       that so long as Lebanon had an 85% gold coverage of its currency, practically no public debt
       and a non-functioning of the income tax system which resulted in most Lebanese not paying any
       income tax, it was perhaps a bit too much to expect American taxpayers to fork over large
       sums for Lebanon, particularly when the customs revenues for the past two years had been the
       highest in history.</p>
      <p>Despite the impact of such an answer, it is certain that we will be called upon once more
       to go through the not very rewarding process of convincing the Lebanese that <persName
        corresp="#p_MC9">Charles Malik</persName>’s promise of “unlimited, unconditional American
       aid” is a figment of Lebanese political imagination. I said somewhat wearily this morning to
       Maitre Maurice <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0694"/>that I wished the Lebanese Embassy in
       Washington had to carry some of the burdens of furthering Lebanon’s interest vis-à-vis the
       United States.</p>
      <p>It is very apparent to the Country Team that if the contemplated winding up of <gloss
        target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/L is carried out as was apparently forecast by <gloss
        target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/W earlier this year, there would be unfortunate political
       repercussions seriously affecting U.S. prestige in Lebanon which would likewise make us
       vulnerable to Soviet countermeasures taking advantage of the situation. <gloss
        target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/W will recall that during the heyday of Point IV, the Americans
       practically pushed their way into Beirut because it was a good base of operations and a
       pleasant place to live. Likewise during the period when the Department of State was seeking
       to “sell" the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> doctrine, Judge Richards
       practically bartered ten million dollars of economic aid in return for the sole joint
       communiqué by an Arab Government supporting the premises of that doctrine. In 1958 the United
       States went to immense expense and risk in sending an expeditionary force to Lebanon and in
       addition gave $12.5 million of cash grant aid to this small client country. Despite the
       unremitting efforts of the undersigned to put the aid picture in a proper and much restricted
       focus, where in fact it is today, for the United States abruptly to eliminate the <gloss
        target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> mission would in my considered judgment invite invidious
       comparisons with what we do elsewhere and might even leave Lebanon in a resentful frame of
       mind, ready to deal with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on terms prejudicial to
       our interest. Withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/L would also arouse an
       outcry in the Christian half of the Lebanese population and would exacerbate Christian–Moslem
       differences.</p>
      <p>I continue to feel that we should endeavor to restrict the aid program for Lebanon, but not
       to wipe it out altogether. Ultimately, as I have told high officers of the Department and
        <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, I would anticipate a much truncated <gloss
        target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/L as a branch of the Embassy, the Mission Director to become
       a regular Counselor of Embassy for Economic Aid Affairs.</p>

      <p>General Risden, who had just returned from Jordan, gave a brief summary of his survey of
       the Jordan military forces. He and his team had approached the problem of what could be done
       to strengthen the Jordan forces in two ways: (1) what Jordan could do and (2) what we could
       do. They had made a complete survey of all units of the Jordan military services. They had
       given to King Hussein 25 pages of recommendations for action<note n="2" xml:id="d383fn2">Not
        found.</note> which could be completed within the resources of the Jordanians. The King had
       seemed pleased with these recommendations and had issued immediate instructions to his staff
       to implement them.</p>
      <p>The Jordan Army was not bad, but had been on police duty for almost two years. General
       Risden felt we should investigate the possibility of strengthening the police forces and
       returning the army to military duty. Although the Jordanians undoubtedly had the capability
       of maintaining internal security with the army, this function should be given to the police
       as much as possible. The army needed training and he had suggested a plan for rotation of
       units through a training cycle at Zerqa. The police forces needed mobility, weapons and
       training.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> asked if the program of strengthening
       the police would be expensive. General Risden said he believed not. It would require training
       in the US, some jeeps, and an increase of about 1, 000 men.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> asked if the Jordanians had pressed the
       question of two additional brigades? General Risden said they had not. They did not have
       depth in trained officers to staff an expanded army and should concentrate on improving the
       units they had on hand. The Deputy Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_SMGS1"
        >Shara</persName>’, seemed to be well aware of this. However, the army did need some
       additional equipment. Perhaps this should include anti-aircraft equipment (40mm cannons and
       cal., 50 <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0697"/>machine guns), communications equipment and
       vehicles. It was perhaps advisable that equipment supplied should come primarily from the
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in order to avoid yearly requests for spare parts from us.
       The army also needed training of staff officers. However, there was a shortage of officers
       who were capable of benefiting from training in the U.S.</p>
      <p>General Risden said that the organization of the Jordan army was basically sound and he saw
       no requirement for change. He listed the strength of the army as follows:</p>
      <p>Regular Army—35, 000</p>
      <p>National Guard—29, 000</p>
      <p>Border Guard—15, 000</p>
      <p>Reserves—10, 000</p>
      <p>Inactive National Guards—20, 000</p>
      <p>This was a sizeable establishment for Jordan. The primary requirement was for improving
       these existing forces. The Jordanians needed a staff school and their military academy was in
       terrible shape because of the varying levels of education and experience of the students. He
       had recommended the establishment of a prep school in order to provide a body of relatively
       uniformly educated candidates.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> asked if General Risden had been able
       to talk to the British about these matters. General Risden said that he had talked to them a
       little but most of the British officers had been extremely busy with preparations for
       withdrawal and he had had little chance to consult with them. He had found that the British
       held a rather low opinion of the capabilities of Jordanian military personnel. He did not
       share this opinion and had been very favorably impressed by the officers and men with whom he
       had come in contact. The Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_Majali1"
        >Majali</persName>, was not the real brains of the army. The most effective officer was
       General <persName corresp="#p_SMGS1">Shara</persName>’, the Deputy Chief of Staff, who was an
       excellent man. He probably was willing to serve whoever was in power and therefore could be
       classified an opportunist. This was not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> asked if the Jordan army could maintain
       the modern equipment which we might supply to them. General Risden replied that they had very
       high maintenance standards and that he had been very favorably impressed by their work shops
       and by their ability to continue operating vehicles which we would have discarded long ago.
       He thought their ability to maintain new equipment was comparable to that of West European
       armies.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that we had three considerations
       which we thought should be borne in mind: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>We wished to avoid adding further burdens to the Jordan economy;</item>
        <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"/>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>We hoped to be able to satisfy the requirements of the Jordan Government; and</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>We would wish to consult with the British, who had been extremely interested in this
         matter, before taking any definitive action. General Risden said that he understood these
         considerations and had kept them in mind. He hoped his report would be completed by
         November 24 and that we would have a copy soon after that date. He was planning to return
         to his division on November 25 but would be available to come to Washington for
         consultation with us at any time.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>General Risden spoke very highly of the work which Mr. <persName>Bennsky</persName> had
       done in Jordan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> expressed his thanks to
       General Risden for undertaking to lead the survey mission and said that we had considered
       this mission particularly important in terms of US policy in the area.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> at the
       house of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName>. Discussions took place before
       dinner, during dinner, and after dinner over a period of several hours. The Prime Minister
       began the talks with an eloquent and persuasive presentation of his views on area problems,
       U.S. policy in the Middle East, and the future of Jordan.</p>
      <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0700"/>
      <p>Rifa’i began by pointing out that all of the countries of the area desire stability and
       progress. However, there are several obstacles, not least of which are the many facets of the
       Palestine Problem, which have stood and still stand in the way of the achievement of
       political stability in the Middle East. The Prime Minister said he did not wish to review the
       Palestine Problem in detail. It had had grave effects on area stability, as Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> was surely aware, but the Palestine Problem is by no
       means solely to blame for area instability and unrest. Taking off from this point, the Prime
       Minister launched into a historical review of the role of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> in producing area instability. Rifa’i introduced no new facts concerning
       the role of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but he emphasized that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is now in decline and that it is therefore of overriding
       importance that the United States should not do anything at this time to slow the process of
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s decline. If events were allowed to develop
       in the present trend, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would soon no longer be
       the predominant leader and force in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>In further development of his idea that factors other than the Palestine Problem are also
       to blame for area instability, Rifa’i observed that Arab leaders at the time had made a major
       error in including Egypt when they formed the Arab League. Egypt has never been a part of the
       Arab world but is now attempting to dominate it. It has been enabled to do so through the
       Arab League and through its exploitation of Arab nationalism. After a long exploration of
       this thesis, the Prime Minister then said that the only natural expression of Arab unity
       would be a union that included present-day Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. This would be
       a viable geographical entity, but it was obviously not feasible to contemplate a union that
       would include Lebanon and Israel. However, the importance of bringing about a union of Jordan
       and Syria could not be exaggerated.</p>
      <p>In pursuing his discussion of a union of Jordan and Syria, Rifa’i said that “the map must
       now be reexamined and the colors changed”. He emphasized that in the present situation the
       union of Jordan and Syria would be somewhat easier to bring about than it had been for
       several years, for today Syria is no longer an independent republic but an unhappy colony of
       Egypt. If Jordan should become amalgamated with Syria, then Arab unity would have been
       achieved as “God and Nature intended it”. The only solution to the long-term problem of
       Jordan’s viability is the union of Jordan and Syria. Such a unity would help to bring
       political stability to the Middle East because Jordan would no longer serve as an invitation
       for adventures on the part of Israel and the nearby Arab states.</p>
      <p>In commenting on Rifa’i’s various propositions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> took the opportunity to temper the possible effects on Jordan of
       remarks on U.S. policy toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> which had been
       attributed to him by the Beirut press on the previous day. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> reviewed the development <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0701"/>of
       the present U.S. attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> emphasizing
       that the U.S. is not seeking at any cost to improve relations with <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. However, the U.S. does seek a better basis for improved
       relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, which if they come will have resulted
       from a gradual process on a two-way basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> said that in so doing the U.S. would not “sacrifice” its friends among
       the independent countries with which we have good relations. Prime Minister Rifa’i appeared
       to grasp and to understand this statement of the U.S. position toward <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, but he made it clear in various remarks that he feels
       strongly that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should not be aided in any way at
       this time. He also stressed that if a better basis for improved relations with <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should be found, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> should not be allowed to use improved relations with the U.S. as a means
       of playing off the U.S. against the Soviets, which he would surely seek to do.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> told the Prime Minister that the U.S.
       in principle does not object to changing of colors on the map provided that the change is in
       the interest of and results from the freely expressed desires of the peoples concerned. The
       U.S. would be greatly interested, therefore, that the right means be used to bring about a
       union of Jordan and Syria and not an improper means. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> then said that he did not believe the future of Jordan could be assured
       by military action against Syria. Although he could agree with the Prime Minister’s analysis
       that the outlook for Jordan as a separate and independent state is not bright because of
       Jordan’s lack of resources, nevertheless we do not believe that the aim of union with Syria
       would justify resort to military action. At this point Prime Minister Rifa’i shifted his
       ground and said that he had not been thinking of overt aggression. However, the vital
       interests of Jordan are continually affected adversely by actions taken by so-called sister
       states against Jordan. He stressed that Jordan must have an outlet to the Mediterranean and
       cannot remain at the mercy of a hostile Syria.</p>
      <p>The conversation shifted at this point to Jordan’s financial situation. The Prime Minister
       said that the Jordan Government and the whole country are deeply grateful for U.S.
       assistance. “Our only hope is that Jordan’s role will continue to be appreciated and that
       further material support will be forthcoming to keep Jordan going”. Rifa’i noted that Jordan
       has had an important role in preserving peace in the Middle East and in preventing the area
       from falling to a new kind of imperialism. Jordan’s present and its near future are by no
       means clear or assured, and it is important that Jordan not be allowed to shake economically
       at any time. The Prime Minister then went into detail concerning Jordan’s need for an
       additional $10 million in budgetary assistance. He stressed that this deficit had resulted
       almost entirely <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0702"/>from budgetary arrangements for the
       Army made under the short-lived Arab Union and then inherited by Jordan following the Iraqi
       Coup.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> described frankly the U.S. attitude
       toward budgetary support and told the Prime Minister he could give him no encouragement that
       the U.S. could help to make up this deficit. The Prime Minister then argued that Jordan would
       be a “show case" for the United States in the Middle East and urged, if necessary, that other
       countries be cut to provide for modest Jordanian needs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> commented that the U.S. had already amply demonstrated its generosity.
       The Prime Minister should consider what the U.S. has already given Jordan in comparison with
       the total Jordan budget. Moreover, budgetary support was the most difficult form of aid to
       justify to Congress, and he could therefore offer the Prime Minister no hope that the U.S.
       would be able to help defray the $10 million deficit.<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">Rifai took
        up the request for budgetary support again with <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"

      <p>In briefing the National Security Council on December 11 on significant world developments
       affecting U.S. security, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> offered the
       following assessment of developments in Jordan, which prompted a response from the President:
        <quote rend="blockquote">
        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that there was also a plot
         against King Hussein in Jordan, a plot directed from a new and unusual source, namely, one
         of the Bedouin tribes. We have been less concerned than some others about the likelihood of
         this plot succeeding but both King Hussein and his Prime Minister, Rifai, are at the moment
         greatly concerned about the violability of Jordan and we fear that they will undertake
         plots with the objective of trying to detach Syria from the United Arab Republic and join
         Syria to Jordan. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also
         stressed the need to watch for mounting hostilities between Syria and Israel as a result of
         border incidents. It was somewhat worrisome that [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text
          not declassified</hi>].</p>
        <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0703"/>
        <p>“The President inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether the
         latter had more information to indicate connivance between Jordan and Israel. Mr. <persName
          corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that there was no evidence of conniving
         between the two states but that the actions of the one might trigger the actions of the
         other and they might then move along parallel lines. The President inquired whether such
         parallel movement would not have the result of lining up all the rest of the Arab world
         against Jordan and Israel. It seemed to the President that something was going on in this
         area that did not clearly meet the eye. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
         agreed with the President and suggested the possibility that the French might be involved
         in something. While he doubted any dramatic moves in the near future, the situation needed
         to be closely watched. The President said that as far as he was concerned, he suspected the
         worst.” (Memorandum of discussion at the 390th Meeting of the National Security Council,

       appeal for $10 million additional aid this <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>, reciting
       earnest efforts of GOJ to keep requirement to minimum. He said inevitable increase in budget
       needs followed financial confusion arising from establishment and later dissolution of Arab
       Union. He said failure obtain additional funds would mean cut-back in security forces which
       would be not only serious but even “catastrophic”.</p>
      <p><persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> informed both King and Rifai that matter
       under active consideration by USG and response would be communicated by <persName
        corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName> as soon as instructions received from Washington.
       However he wished explain situation as he saw it. At urgent request GOJ US had several months
       ago indicated maximum budgetary assistance which Jordan could expect this <gloss
        target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>. It did so since it realized Jordan needed <pb n="672"
        xml:id="pg_672" facs="0704"/>aid in that magnitude and should have firm knowledge ceiling
       for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> in order to permit realistic planning. It wished avoid
       situation in which GOJ without knowing what to expect would incur obligations exceeding
       availabilities. Amount of aid was appreciable, particularly considering extreme difficulty of
       USG in providing budgetary support for any country. Difficulty understandably greatly
       enhanced if budget problems rather than decreasing increased as in case of Jordan over past
       three fiscal years. He felt Jordan’s leaders would appreciate frankness so that they did not
       have false hopes re extent which US might now find it possible to assist in resolving new
       deficit problem. He thought it unrealistic to expect USG would provide $10 million for this
       purpose. Jordan itself must take firm and vigorous action. For example, we thought Jordan
       should use that part of reserve ($5.6 million) representing increase from amount in reserve
       as of time US budgetary support commenced. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>
       said he had been disturbed re reports of negotiations by Jordan for procurement from Britain
       of additional aircraft which would impose direct drain upon budget. He thought expenditures
       of this kind should not be undertaken outside of previously approved budget items. Other
       economies in budget should be effected. He thought USG might be able provide some flexibility
       between third and fourth quarters <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>. Under most optimistic
       circumstances, however, problem could not be resolved without serious efforts on part of GOJ.
       Rifai reiterated he would make all possible efforts but urged, as did King, that way be found
       for US to help meet serious situation.</p>
      <p>Country team has reviewed with <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> various
       aspects of budget crisis in light political considerations. Following comments and
       recommendations are submitted with his approval and concurrence: <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Even assuming earnest efforts by GOJ to resolve problem, it appears unlikely that
         budgetary deficit can be eliminated without additional US assistance if serious cuts in
         security forces expenditures to be avoided. In present situation this not only would be
         highly demoralizing to armed forces but also to GOJ leaders who attach paramount importance
         to forces which they regard as Jordan’s greatest asset in tense Middle East situation.
         Rifai persistently stated that regime would collapse if security forces reduced. While this
         may be exaggeration, it contains enough elements of truth to render it unwise take chance
         at this juncture.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Whatever further concessions are made to GOJ in matter of budget, it should be made
         abundantly clear that they can not be taken as precedent. (Rifai positively assured
          <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> in this connection that GOJ would not
         regard additional budgetary assistance this year as basis for requesting more aid next
         year, although in Arab fashion he did add words to effect it would be nice if next year
         budget could be established in round figure $45 million.)</item>
        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0705"/>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>We recommend that Rifai now be told that provision additional $10 million out of
         question. First measure to meet situation should be utilization $5.6 million of reserve,
         bringing total down to figure of September 1957. We believe, however, that deficit
         remaining after all other practicable economies effected up to $4.4 million should be
         provided by US, and earnestly hope funds for this purpose can be made available. Thus
         Jordan’s budget deficit for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1959 would be covered.
         Figure of $4.4 million might be reduced by as much as $500, 000 representing balance <gloss
          target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> net counterpart expected, although impossible at this time to
         estimate precise amount.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Immediate authorizations required to meet December budget situation, primarily army
         payroll, are (a) release of $1.7 million currently on deposit <gloss target="#t_POL1"
          >POL</gloss> counterpart special account, and (b) release $4 million previously reserved
         for last quarter current <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>.</item>
        <label>(5)</label>
        <item>As to source of up to $4.4 million additional funds, we believe this must be in
         addition to $10 million set aside for first quarter <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
         1960. In discussing matter with GOJ and setting forth what we prepared to do meet current
         budget, we propose make it clear that USG not planning on budgetary aid to Jordan <gloss
          target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1960 above level provided <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
         1959 excluding $4.4 million added assistance which for special non-recurring purposes, and
         GOJ must understand there can be no assurance of any sum before appropriation of funds by
         Congress and determination world-wide allocation by USG.</item>

       within recipient countries generated local currency used meet critical needs. In Jordan’s

       I said my opinion Jordan has received very preferential treatment by US Congress which is
       most reluctant provide any country with budgetary support as matter of fact for two

        years of <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> reserves by $5.6 million represents unutilized
        US aid, <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> considers this erroneous and probably result

        meet requirements (A) operation/maintenance of Hawker–Hunter aircraft and (B) inclusion in
        new army brigade of personnel now in National Guard. Prime Minister stated latter
        contemplated per General Risden recommendations.</item>

      </list>
      <p>In addition to above, Prime Minister referred to 2 note sheets on his desk which he stated
       were in King’s handwriting and submitted by King for inclusion in aide-mémoire reply. Prime
       Minister stated that he had “sweetened” King’s language for inclusion in reply but that King
       was emphasizing again that US offer for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1960 “contrary to
       assurances of US support he has received from highest US levels, and that the present Jordan
       could not survive with the aid offered”.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister then stated he “could not put his hand" to a budget situation such as the
       limited US aid of <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1960 would require and that in such
       case he “would retire to his house and give the King opportunity to form another government
       to cope with the crisis”.</p>
      <p>During meeting it was made obvious by Prime Minister that upon serious reflection and study
       since December 20 prospective situation for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1960

       again same day with King at which <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador <persName

         >Wright</persName> and Rifai concerning the King’s planned visit to Washington. Rifai noted
        that the “real issue” to be resolved in Washington was whether the United States was willing
        to admit that the continuance of Jordan as a sovereign, independent state was essential to
        the maintenance of free world influence in the Middle East. If so, Rifai was certain that
        the amount of money necessary to accomplish this was unimportant. (<hi rend="italic"
         >Ibid.,</hi> 785.11/2–259)</note> We are becoming increasingly concerned by indications
       contained reftel and other messages from Embassy that King and Rifai expect to use King’s
       forthcoming trip as means attempt force USG agree provide substantially increased aid to
       Jordan on indefinite basis and to commit itself to indefinite preservation of Jordan as
       independent state. We have no intention of agreeing to either of these requests and we
       foresee that irreparable damage could be done to our relations with Jordan should King and
       Rifai come here in effect to deliver unacceptable ultimatum to USG, especially if such a
       development were to become public knowledge. We desire you in discreet manner to ensure that
       King and Rifai can have no possible grounds for expectation, before coming to US, that USG
       will be in a position to satisfy grandiose ideas. Following points which you should tactfully
       convey to King and Rifai are provided to assist you in this effort.</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>This visit is private one undertaken at King’s initiative. As King has been informed,
        USG welcomes opportunity to receive him informally in Washington and to exchange views with
        him. Such exchange of views would be entirely appropriate during an informal visit of this
        nature but it neither customary nor desirable for foreign Chiefs of State during informal
        visits at their initiative to utilize occasion to carry <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680"
         facs="0712"/>out negotiations or seek obtain commitments from USG. While US is of course
        entirely prepared to discuss US–Jordan relations generally with King and to indicate its
        views as to future course of these relations, it is not prepared to engage during visit in
        specific negotiations or commitments regarding problems which may exist. Preferable for
        these matters to be discussed via normal diplomatic channels.</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>US has given firm and repeated evidence of its full support for Jordan and has, in view
        of its deep interest in Jordan and its desire to support King and Jordan Government,
        violated long established strong preference by indicating level of support which it plans to
        provide Jordan during Fiscal 1960, prior to authorization by Congress of necessary funds. US
        has thus clearly shown its support for continuance of Jordan as sovereign independent state.
        US however is very heavily committed in global aid programs and is not prepared to provide
        large sums of money over and above level already indicated to <gloss target="#t_HKJ1"
         >HKJ</gloss>. Department desires to be frank with King and Rifai on this point in order
        that they may have no false hopes regarding position of USG.</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>US had on number of occasions through such instruments as the Tripartite Declaration
        and Middle East Resolution revealed its deep interest in preservation of independence and
        security of Middle East states. This interest was dramatically illustrated last summer by
        despatch of US troops to Lebanon, by important US support for British troops sent to Jordan,
        and by substantial support for Jordan in many fields. US does not have mutual defense treaty
        with any Arab state and has resisted recurrent and powerful Israeli pressures for such
        defense arrangement. US furthermore believes that mutual defense treaty with major Western
        power would not be in best interests of Jordan and of King in view of prevailing political
        trends in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> and deterioration of relations which occurred
        between Jordan and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> when Jordan had defense treaty with
         <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, subsequently denounced by Jordan. Accordingly King and
        Rifai should have no reason to believe that US now prepared conclude defense treaty with
        Jordan.</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Finally you should emphasize to King and both Rifais that USG sincerely welcomes
        forthcoming trip and opportunity for exchange of views with Chief of State for whom it has
        such high admiration. USG, in view of the relations of trust it shares with <gloss
         target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss>, plans to speak with King and Rifai on basis of confidence.
        King will of course have access to US press and since his remarks may be widely reported we
        feel sure that in spirit of close US-Jordanian relations he will exercise special care in
        public references to matter which may be discussed with USG in Washington. King will also
        appreciate desirability of refraining from <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0713"/>any
        public references to other states, particularly in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, which
        could embarrass US in its relations with those states.<note n="3" xml:id="d391fn3">In

          <persName corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName> felt certain that neither the King nor Rifai
         were left with any illusions concerning the limitations imposed by circumstances on the

       particular reference to various courses of action open to King Hussein.</p>
      <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
      <list>
       <label>1.</label>
       <item>King Hussein and Prime Minister Rifai feel that their regime urgently needs
        reassurances of strong US moral and material support if it is to maintain its pro-Western
        position and even survive in the face of strong domestic discontent and isolation from the
        prevailing trends of Pan-Arab nationalism. (Paras. 5–6, 8, 10)</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Over the long run we have little confidence in Hussein’s ability to hold his throne or,
        indeed, in the viability of Jordan as a state. In the short run, however, his own position
        and Jordan’s existence are bolstered by an uneasy equilibrium of external forces, which
        maintains Jordan as a buffer and preserves the regime in default of a generally acceptable
        alternative. Israel prefers Hussein to a pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
        successor. <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0714"/><persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName> wants to avoid a showdown with the West and Israel over Jordan’s future
        particularly while he is preoccupied with the Communist threat in Iraq. (Paras. 6, 9, 10,
        12, 14)</item>
       <label>3.</label>
       <item>If Hussein should receive convincing reaffirmation of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName> statement of April 1957,<note n="2" xml:id="d392fn2">At a news
         conference in Augusta, Georgia, on April 24, 1957, Press Secretary <persName
          corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> stated that he had been authorized to say that both
         the President and the Secretary of State regarded the independence and integrity of Jordan
         as vital. For the transcript, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
          Documents, 1957</hi>, p. 1024.</note> he would probably continue policies of co-operation
        with the West. If at the other extreme he became convinced that the US was anxious to
        disengage from Jordan, he would reassess his entire position. He would seek increased
        support from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and possibly from <persName
         corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, Saudi Arabia or even Iraq. None of these alternatives
        is very promising. It is more likely that Hussein would abdicate rather than try desperate
        measures to recoup his fortunes—such as an attack on Syria. (Paras. 19–22)</item>
       <label>4.</label>
       <item>Hussein would face another choice if he failed to get the degree of US backing that he
        would like but was still convinced of US readiness to continue substantial support to Jordan
        and his throne. In this situation he would probably seek peace with the Pan-Arab
        nationalists while maintaining the best possible relations with the West. He would probably
        feel compelled to replace Rifai and other members of his government with less pro-Western
        politicians. Although there is no assurance that such a course would preserve Hussein’s
        position, we believe that some such adjustment represents his best hope of retaining his
        throne for the longest period of time. (Paras. 23–24)</item>

        the Hussein regime has taken the exposed and dangerous position in the Middle East of being
        an ally of the West and an opponent of Nasserism.</item>
       <label>6.</label>
       <item>Hussein does indeed face a very precarious situation. The monarchy and the Rifai
        government are unpopular with most of the Jordanian people of Palestinian origin, including
        some half-million refugees from Israeli-held areas of former Palestine. The Palestinians
        have a relatively high degree of political consciousness and among them not only do the
        doctrines of Pan-Arab nationalism have great appeal, but <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
         >Nasser</persName> himself has considerable prestige. The Jordanian Communist Party,
        although illegal and severely harassed, is active among the West Jordanians. The King’s
        chief source of domestic support is among the more traditionalist half-million East
        Jordanians—largely Bedouin tribes—and the army, most of which is recruited from the latter
        groups. Between Jordan’s disparate elements there are virtually irreconcilable antagonisms
        and there is little loyalty to the idea of Jordan as a state.</item>
       <label>7.</label>
       <item>The political instability of Jordan is intensified by its extreme poverty and
        dependence on Western assistance for sheer survival. The combination of a nonviable economy
        and military expenditures far beyond it resources results in large and chronic budgetary
        deficits. These were once offset by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> subsidies but since
        1957 they have been made up largely by the US. In the coming fiscal year Jordan will require
        more than $45 million in direct budgetary aid merely to overcome the deficit in a $70 odd
        million ordinary government budget.</item>
       <label>8.</label>
       <item>For almost two years, Hussein has kept his domestic opponents off balance by repression
        and intimidation, including the use of martial law, the jailing of numerous opposition
        figures, and rigid controls over the parliament. Prime Minister Rifai is an especially
        strong advocate of these tactics and is so identified in the minds of most Jordanians. Some
        nationalist opposition leaders have gone into exile in Syria or other Arab states, where
        they continue to engage in conspiracies against Hussein and his regime. The effectiveness
        and activities of those who remain have been circumscribed by the regime’s security
        measures.</item>
       <label>9.</label>
       <item>The King has shown striking personal courage and determination in the face of dangers
        and provocations, such as recurrent conspiracies against himself, the assassination of his
        Hashemite cousins in Baghdad, the isolation of Jordan by a <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
         >UAR</gloss> land and air blockade following the British intervention last July. There are,
        however, indications that the strain is beginning to tell on Hussein and that he stands in
        increasing need of reassurances that the US is effectively behind him.</item>
       <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0716"/>
       <label>10.</label>
       <item>But the regime and Jordan have survived primarily because external forces in the area
        have operated to maintain the state as a buffer zone and to bolster its government in
        default of a generally acceptable alternative. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
        not recently encouraged the overthrow of the King because of: (a) preoccupation with
        problems in Syria and Iraq; (b) fear of Western reaction; and (c) fear of war with Israel.
        Israel for its part has also reduced pressures upon the Jordanian regime, principally
        because it is apprehensive that the collapse of Hussein’s regime would lead to a
         pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> successor.</item>
       <label>11.</label>
       <item>In these circumstances, while Hussein’s and Jordan’s short-term prospects appear better
        than they have for some time, it cannot be concluded that their position is strong. The
        extent of hostility toward Hussein and his dynasty within Jordan makes possible at any time
        a coup or even assassination—a fate which his grandfather met at the hands of an Arab
        refugee from Palestine. Even the loyalty of some army elements and East Jordan tribal
        leaders is not above question. There has been considerable evidence of conspiracies among
        officers, which is sufficient to demonstrate that the Jordanian Army is not immune from the
        kind of conspiracies against entrenched regimes that have been successfully brought off in
        other Arab states. Finally, a shift in the external forces might upset the equilibrium at
        any time.</item>

        the British Government, and with actual relief in other quarters. There was, for example,
        only limited enthusiasm in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> over the British

      <list>
       <label>20.</label>
       <item>If Hussein should receive from the US convincing confirmation of the kind of support
        represented by the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> statement of April
        1957, he would probably retain Rifai and persist in policies of cooperation with the West.
        His position and that of Jordan would be <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0718"
        />strengthened at least in the short run. Some of his opponents would probably be
        intimidated, and certainly his own will and determination to cope with his problems would be
        fortified. In the longer run it is doubtful that Western support per se would prove
        effective in maintaining Hussein in power if he were faced with determined efforts by
         <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or anti-Hashemite forces in Jordan to
        overthrow him. Continued repression of the opposition may serve stability for a time, but it
        also fans the fires of hostility to the regime. Moreover, the more his dependence upon the
        West is made manifest, the greater his vulnerability to the potent Arab nationalist charge
        that he is a Western stooge.</item>
       <label>21.</label>
       <item>If, at the other extreme, Hussein should become convinced that the US was anxious to
        disengage from the Jordanian situation and from support for his government, he would feel
        compelled to reassess his entire position. He would almost certainly move to disassociate
        himself from Prime Minister Rifai, though Rifai would probably relieve him of any decision
        in the matter by resigning first.</item>
       <label>22.</label>
       <item>In the above case, Hussein’s alternatives would be few and unpromising. What bargaining
        power he has in the area would be substantially reduced. He would almost certainly seek
        renewed British support and aid. However, he would have little chance of getting the British
        to resume assistance on the previous scale. He could also seek support from Saudi Arabia,
        the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, or Iraq, but past experience shows that he would be
        unlikely to get adequate economic and political support. Hussein might even consider an
        approach to the Soviet Union, but we think it unlikely that he could work out an arrangement
        with the Bloc which would provide for the survival of his regime.</item>
       <label>23.</label>
       <item>If in these circumstances Hussein met with no success, he might give serious
        consideration to desperate measures. He might, for example, attempt to implement his
        frequently expressed wish to invade Syria, in the belief that discontented elements there
        would rally to him, and in the hope that the West would come to his support. On the whole,
        however, we believe he would be more likely to abdicate than to attempt such moves.</item>
       <label>24.</label>
       <item>If Hussein fails to get the broader commitments which he and Rifai will be seeking, but
        is convinced that the US will continue political support and financial assistance at about
        present levels, he would be likely to try a third course of action. In this situation he
        would probably feel that he must make some retreat from his present outspoken pro-West and
         anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> position. He would probably seek to
        assume a posture somewhat like that of Saudi Arabia and of Lebanon—maintaining relations
        with the Western Powers, but seeking his peace with the Pan-Arab nationalists and trying to
        foster a Jordanian brand of Arab nationalism as well. Hussein’s prospects for success in
        such a course would still depend on public evidence of continued US <pb n="687"
         xml:id="pg_687" facs="0719"/>moral and material support, since without such backing,
        Hussein’s position would probably be too weak for him to deal effectively with the Pan-Arab
        nationalists.</item>

      <list>
       <label>25.</label>
       <item>On the whole, we believe that some accommodation to the forces of Pan-Arab nationalism
        represents King Hussein’s best hope of retaining his throne for the longest period of time.
        There are, of course, dangers involved in making concessions to his opponents in and out of
        Jordan and in releasing turbulent political forces previously suppressed. But these dangers
        are inherent in the essential political instability of this weak and heterogeneous
        state.</item>
       <label>26.</label>
       <item>Even with the best of policies and outside support, we have little confidence in
        Hussein’s ability over the long run to hold his throne in the face of the political forces
        at work in Jordan and throughout the area. Eventually, it appears probable that his regime
        will give way, gradually or abruptly, to a successor more in tune with the political trends
        prevailing in the Arab world. This may not come without a violent struggle involving
        external intervention and the breakup of Jordan.</item>

      <p>Although the forthcoming visit of King Hussein of Jordan is to be unofficial and we have
       made it clear to the Jordanians that we shall not expect to engage in formal negotiations on
       this occasion, the King and his Prime Minister, <persName>Samir Rifa</persName>’i, have been
       assured that there would be an opportunity for discussions with the President, you and other
       officials of the Department while they are in Washington. The schedule for these discussions
       is the subject of a separate memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d393fn3">Dated March 11.
        (Department of State, Central Files, 785.11/3–1159)</note> and individual briefing papers on
       specific topics are being prepared. The coming visit may well have a crucial effect on
       U.S.-Jordan relations, however, inasmuch as we can anticipate a concerted effort by King
       Hussein and his adroit Prime Minister to extract from the U.S. assurances that we are firmly
       committed to the proposition that the continued existence of Jordan as presently constituted
       is vital to the maintenance of the Western position in the Near East. Prime Minister Rifa’i
       has on several occasions asserted to our Charge in Amman that he views such an assurance from
       the U.S. Government as essential if he is to continue at the head of the Government, and has
       made it clear that in his mind such an assurance would mean a continuing commitment to Jordan
       of military and financial assistance significantly above the present substantial level, as
       well as political and diplomatic support for the present regime in its self-envisaged role as
       the leader of an anti-Communist and anti-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> Arab
       nationalism.</p>
      <p>It is not possible for us to satisfy the desires and ambitions of the King and Rifa’i, and
       it is important that we obviate any possible misunderstanding on that score, while at the
       same time avoiding too great a disappointment to our visitors (with a possibility of highly
       undesirable repercussions). <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> therefore considers it of the
       utmost importance that there be clear understanding within the Government of the line of
       policy to be followed and agreement on the tactics to be pursued in the forthcoming talks
       with the Jordanians. To this end, the following recommendations are offered for your urgent
       consideration.</p>

        and political dependence on the U.S. (and, to some degree, the U.K.).</item>
       <label>2.</label>
       <item>Our tactics (to be reflected in position papers) should be designed to further our
        general objective without provoking a reaction of desperation or despair, which could
        possibly lead to the King’s abdicating without making provision for an orderly change of
        regime, or, alternatively, to his embarking on military adventures in Syria.</item>

            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 60 budget, development and technical assistance
           generous, given our expectations of the likely level of U.S. <gloss target="#t_FY1"

           these funds. It should be indicated to the Jordanians that in view of the magnitude of
           U.S. assistance it is important that prior consultations with U.S. representatives take
           place concerning Jordan’s annual budget levels. We would also expect to be consulted

          situation so requires. We should also be prepared to be somewhat flexible, in view of
          Jordan’s acute budget problems, as regards the division of available special assistance
          funds between direct budget support and economic development (e.g., we have already
          promised $40.5 million for budget assistance and would be willing to consider making
          available an additional amount for this purpose by transferring a portion of such economic
          development funds as might be allocated to Jordan following <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690"

      <p>The Acting Secretary opened the discussion by welcoming the opportunity for a frank
       exchange of views with His Majesty and Prime Minister Rifa’i. Mr. <persName
        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> noted that no formal negotiations were envisaged during
       the King’s visit to Washington but said that he was particularly happy for the chance to meet
       the King and Prime Minister Rifa’i since personal relationships were of great importance in
       the conduct of foreign affairs.</p>
      <p>King Hussein in replying thanked the Acting Secretary for the warm reception which he had
       been given and said that he too welcomed the chance to discuss with complete frankness
       Jordan’s problems and other matters of mutual interest.</p>
      <p>The Acting Secretary, during the subsequent discussion, said that from the point of view of
       implementation of US aid programs he wanted to make it clear that factors beyond the control
       of the Executive Branch of the Government made it impossible for the United States to give
       any kind of long-term commitments. The Acting Secretary briefly described the role of
       Congress in authorizing and appropriating on an annual basis the necessary funds for foreign
       aid programs, and alluded to the serious difficulties which the program was currently facing
       in Congress. He stressed, however, that the assistance which the US had been giving to Jordan
       was a gauge of our concern for Jordan’s integrity and internal stability and should be taken
       as an earnest of our intentions for the future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
        >Herter</persName> said he was particularly happy to be able to inform the King and Prime
       Minister that the Development Loan Fund had just taken favorable action on an application for
       a loan to the Jordan phosphate industry.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i replied that Jordan was certainly extremely grateful for the generous
       assistance which the US had given and mindful of the considerations mentioned by the Acting
       Secretary. He suggested, however, that Jordan because of its strategic location and political
       role in the Near East had special significance from the US viewpoint and argued that in
       determining the amount of aid for Jordan, the US should take into account not only
       US-Jordanian relations, but also Jordan’s role in connection with the US position vis-à-vis
       other Arab states as well as Jordan’s role with respect to the Israeli situation. Mr.
        <persName>Rifa</persName>’i said Jordan’s case was really quite simple. For good or bad,
       Jordan existed as an independent state. Jordan hoped the US would agree that its continued
       existence was important. If it were concluded that Jordan should disappear, the Jordanians
       would decide how that should be brought about. If Jordan were to survive over the <pb n="692"
        xml:id="pg_692" facs="0724"/>long run, however, the Jordan Government estimated it would
       need substantial assistance over a five to seven year period in order for the country to
       become established on a stable basis. To achieve this, Jordan would count primarily on US
       aid.</p>
      <p>The Acting Secretary reiterated the inability of the US to make any commitment over a five
       to seven year period, to which Rifa’i replied he was only explaining the Jordanian position
       in the hope that general agreement on Jordan’s needs could be reached.</p>
      <p>There followed a brief discussion of the Arab refugee problem with the Acting Secretary
       alluding to the prospective expiration of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>’s mandate
       in 1960 and to the Congressional desire to see progress towards a solution of the refugee
       problem. The Jordanians acknowledged the importance of this problem and emphasized the status
       of the refugees as citizens of Jordan. The King pointed out that Jordan was trying to absorb
       the refugees but that the problem was related to the economic development of the country
       which in turn was largely dependent upon the level of US aid.</p>

      <p>King Hussein reviewed the situation in the Near East as seen from his point of view,
       stressing that Jordan’s difficulties stemmed principally from its refusal to follow blindly
       in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s footsteps and accept <pb n="693"
        xml:id="pg_693" facs="0725"/>without question <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
       >Nasser</persName>’s domination of the Arab World. The King expressed gratitude for US
       support and assistance without which he said Jordan could not have survived. He said that
       Jordan is fighting a battle against international Communism not for the sake of the West but
       because of its own convictions. The King emphasized <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s role in helping to bring the Soviets into the area in the first place
       and giving them the chance to achieve respectability in the eyes of the Arab people. He
       reviewed <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s efforts in the past to subvert Iraq,
       Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia. The King asserted Syria had been an easy target
       because of internal dissension. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had succeeded
       in taking it over through bribery and political manipulation. The King asserted that
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was attacking Iraq not because of Communism
       but because the Iraqi Government had failed to fall into line. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> was indirectly responsible for the Communists’ gaining control in Iraq,
       because Qasim had been forced to turn to the Communists for support against <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>.</p>
      <p>The King rejected the idea of neutrality for the Arab World as being unrealistic in view of
       the relative weakness of the area. He asserted that a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> victory in Iraq would be extremely dangerous, opening the way for
       subversion of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, after which Jordan would be an easy target. Finally,
       Hussein asserted the situation in Syria was worsening for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> and warned that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> could only
       maintain himself if he got outside support at this juncture when he was “practically
       collapsed”. On the other hand, now is the time for Jordan and like-minded countries to take
       the initiative with US help in order to defeat <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       and the Communists.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i followed up the King’s remarks with a more detailed discussion of
       events in the last two years. The Prime Minister asserted Jordan was motivated by two
       principles a) anti-Communism and b) non-intervention by one state in the internal affairs of
       another. Mr. <persName>Rifa</persName>’i conceded that after two years <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had come to the same position as that held by Jordan on
       Communism but said the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> still had not accepted a principle
       of non-intervention. He ridiculed <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attempt to
       differentiate between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communism, alleging this
       was analogous to trying to differentiate between Israel and Zionism. Prime Minister Rifa’i
       stressed the non-Arab nature of Egypt and the fact that Arab nationalism was a “sacred”
       doctrine long ante-dating <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Mr.
        <persName>Rifa</persName>’i, finally, carried the King’s remark about the danger of a
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> victory in Iraq one step further, asserting
       that Jordan was not too much concerned about Communism in Iraq since even if the Communists
       were successful there, the other Arab states were not likely to be infected but would in fact
       fight Communism all the harder. A <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> victory in
       Iraq, however, would open the way to his domination of the whole area.</p>
      <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0726"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that the US had been greatly
       concerned over two aspects of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> (and formerly Egyptian)
       policy. One was the respectability which it had lent to the Soviets in the Arab world, and
       the other was the nature of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> relationships to other
       countries in the area. He cited the Lebanese and Jordanian cases as two occasions when the US
       had helped small nations of the area to defend themselves against <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss> subversion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> stated,
       however, that recent developments had had an important effect in two respects: a) without
       going into the question of motivation, we considered the conflict over Iraq had brought about
       a completely new situation as a result of which there was a much wider appreciation among
       Arabs of the real nature of the relationships between the Soviets and local Communists; b)
       again leaving aside the question of motives, it was obvious there had been an improvement in
       relations between the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and other Arab states. Perhaps this
       had occurred because <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s efforts in countries
       such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Sudan had failed—but whatever the reason, these two factors
       added up to a notable improvement in the Free World position, except in Iraq. It was our hope
       that if the Iraqi situation could be contained, the improvement brought about partly by
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions would present an opportunity for a period of peace
       and tranquility in which solutions to underlying area problems, such as Jordan’s relations
       with <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, could be sought.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> took exception to Mr.
        <persName>Rifa</persName>’i’s view that a <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       victory in Iraq would be more dangerous than a Communist take-over, asserting that the Free
       World would retain a good deal more maneuverability in the former case than in the latter. He
       also made the point that, in our view, although the Communists were making great headway in
       Iraq, important elements in that country desire to maintain freedom from domination by the
       Communists or any other element.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i agreed the situation in Iraq was dangerous but said it would not be
       remedied by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s methods. He averred that
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in attacking Iraq really was fighting a battle
       to hold Syria. Mr. <persName>Rifa</persName>’i concluded by remarking that Jordan wished to
       see <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> go on fighting the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
        >USSR</gloss> since the more he did so the weaker he became. He cautioned, however, that
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> should not be saved at the very moment when he
       had weakened himself in his battle against the Soviets.</p>

      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>, who chaired this meeting, said he
       thought the exchange of views in the morning meeting with the Acting Secretary was very
       useful and had indicated a wide range of interests between the U.S. and Jordan on which there
       was substantial agreement, especially regarding objectives. This afternoon’s meeting provided
       an opportunity for joint discussion of past and future U.S. aid to Jordan. As had already
       been agreed, preparations had not been made for formal negotiations on specific proposals.
       However, these discussions would give Jordan an idea of what the U.S. could and could not do,
       and indicate that the U.S. was prepared to be helpful within these limitations. He then
       invited Prime Minister Rifa’i to set forth his views on U.S. assistance to Jordan.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>’s
       December, 1958 visit to Amman and noted that he was sure we were already aware of his views
       on U.S. assistance from reports by our Embassy in Amman. Thus his task was comparatively
       easy. After expressing the gratitude and indebtedness of his country for past U.S. financial
       assistance, he took the position that Jordan was an essential factor in the Middle East and
       had made a critical contribution to the West in its struggle with the disruptive forces in
       the area. Because of Jordan’s geographic position vis-à-vis Israel, its army carried defense
       responsibilities for all the Arab states and was not required solely for the internal
       security and defense of Jordan. He felt it was fair to say that Jordan, with its limited <pb
        n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0728"/>resources, should not be expected to bear alone this
       overall defense burden. The budget support which Jordan has received, and continues to
       require, is for its army. The question is whether or not Jordan should maintain such a large
       army. If the answer is no, then the financial burden could be reduced and the remaining
       budget expenditures could be generally handled by Jordan. But, if as he believed, because of
       Jordan’s special defense role in the Arab Near East, the answer is yes, then outside budget
       support must be continued. At this point he reviewed the history of the Anglo-Jordanian
        Treaty<note n="2" xml:id="d396fn2">Signed on March 15, 1948, and terminated by exchange of
        notes on March 13, 1957. For text, see United Kingdom Treaty Series No. 26 (1948; Cmd.
        7404).</note> (with its British subsidy to the Jordan Army), its termination in the spring
       of 1957 and the prompt and generous way in which the U.S. had stepped in to fill the gap. If
       Jordan was to be successful in carrying out its internal and area responsibilities, it was
       necessary to move beyond the present day-to-day aid operations to a longer term aid
       commitment from the U.S. Specifically, what Jordan required was: (1) some form of assurance
       that the U.S. would continue its assistance for some defined period of years; and, (2) an
       indication of the magnitude and scope of such assistance. This Jordan requirement remains
       valid, he said, even though he clearly understood, from the morning meeting with the Acting
       Secretary, our constitutional and legislative problems in this regard.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said the U.S. felt that the size and
       role of the Jordan military was a matter largely to be determined by the Jordan Government.
       However, in arriving at this determination, the Jordan Government would obviously have to
       resolve the problem of balancing defense and security plans with financial limitations. He
       noted that U.S. budget support contributions have tended to be somewhat larger than those
       previously provided by the British, and that budget support per se was difficult for us to
       justify to Congress. In fact, it is only because of Jordan’s position in the Near East
       situation that we have been able to provide this type of aid. Further, in order to help the
       Jordan Government plan its budget for the coming year, we made a special and unique exception
       to the established practice of the U.S. Government not to commit funds until they are
       appropriated, and authorized our Chargé in December to commit the U.S. Government to make
       available (subject to Congressional approval) $40.5 million of special assistance funds to
       support Jordan’s fiscal 1960 budget. Recognizing that budget support merely meets Jordan’s
       day-to-day operating requirements and not its economic development needs, the Jordan
       Government should take a hard look at its budget, in terms of putting as much as possible
       into activities which build up the country’s economic potential. After completion of
       Congressional action on the USFY 60 <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0729"/>Mutual Security
       Program and review of world-wide requirements for these funds, we hoped to be able to provide
       some special assistance funds for economic development in Jordan. If this proves possible, we
       would be prepared, in view of Jordan’s acute budget problem, to be somewhat flexible as
       regards division of such funds between budget support and economic development projects.
       However, if the Jordan budget requires U.S. assistance above and beyond the $40.5 million,
       the special assistance which we might be able to make available for economic development
       would be reduced by a corresponding amount. Taking into account all resources likely to be
       available to Jordan, including <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> aid, the $40.5 million in
       U.S. budget support should provide the Jordan Government with sufficient resources to finance
       a budget which meets its essential security and operating requirements.</p>
      <p>In addition, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> pointed out, we have
       already committed ourselves to provide up to 100, 000 tons of Title II PL 480 grains (valued
       at $8.1 million), and agreed to acceleration and flexibility in the use of special assistance
       funds previously obligated for economic development projects in Jordan. These actions alone
       provide the Jordan Government with significant resources to meet its drought relief
       requirements during its coming fiscal year. Further, we are prepared to increase the level of
       Title II PL 480 assistance to meet additional human and livestock needs if Jordan’s drought
       situation so requires. Also, in the realm of economic development, the <gloss
        target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> is prepared to consider applications for development projects
       in Jordan which meet its criteria. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> also
       noted, as the Acting Secretary had in the morning meeting, that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
        >DLF</gloss> had approved a loan of up to $2.5 million for the Jordan Phosphate Company
       project.</p>
      <p>As for a long-term U.S. aid commitment to Jordan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> referred to the Acting Secretary’s statement in the morning meeting
       that, due to legislative limitations, the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government could not
       make such commitments. However, the best assurance that Jordan could have of future U.S. aid
       intentions was our already demonstrated policy of helping Jordan and our policies regarding
       the independence of states in the Middle East and the economic development of underdeveloped
       countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> then asked Mr.
        <persName>Saccio</persName> if he would like to comment.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName>Saccio</persName> said that, as the Prime Minister was undoubtedly aware, the
       Executive Branch of the U.S. Government was taking a very strong position re holding down
       USFY 60 budget expenditures, and that this necessarily affected the anticipated level of
       foreign aid funds. With reference to a long-term U.S. aid commitment, he pointed out that
       Congress, and the American people, backed the objectives of our foreign aid program, as was
       evidenced by the continued annual appropriation <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0730"/>of
       funds for this purpose. However, they were looking for results in terms of concrete economic
       development, and, therefore, were not particularly impressed by budgetary aid.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i stated that there appeared to be no disagreement on general
       principles, and that he understood our difficulties; his Government had problems also. He
       then turned to discussion of U.S. budget support required in <gloss target="#t_JFY1"
        >JFY</gloss> 60 to cover the cost of the military establishment. He explained that U.S.
       budget support exceeded that obtained from the British in past years because (1)
       circumstances in the area necessitated an increase in the size of the military; and, (2)
       units had to be provided which the British had previously undertaken to make available from
       their own forces. He then turned over to General <persName corresp="#p_SMGS1"
        >Shara</persName>’ further discussion of the Jordan military establishment.</p>
      <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SMGS1">Shara</persName>’ said that the Jordan Army had not
       been enlarged very much since the termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty. The addition of
       one brigade and supporting units had been necessary to fill gaps left by the British. In any
       case, it is not expansion of troop strength but increasing costs of maintaining worn-out,
       obsolete equipment from diverse sources that were running up the bill of the military
       establishment. The Jordan Army required a complete standardization of equipment, which,
       although costly now, would in the long run effect economies. He noted that the army still did
       not have enough artillery and, that, although Hawker Hunters were now on hand, it was
       necessary to build up the Air Force to handle them. In conclusion, he stated that Jordan
       cannot be expected to reduce the size of its armed forces, since they are now at absolute
       minimum strength given their internal security and defense responsibilities, and because such
       a move would be disastrous from the internal politico-security standpoint.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister followed up by saying it clearly had not been the intention or desire of
       the Jordan Government to increase the size of the army, rather it was the circumstances
       prevailing in the area and the necessity of closing gaps left when the British pulled out.
       Jordan’s military budget, supported by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, amounted to $35
       million. Jordan originally planned a military budget of $40.6 million for <gloss
        target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 59. During Arab Union negotiations in Baghdad, the military
       figure was raised to $46.2 million, but the Jordan Government saw no reason to be concerned
       since it expected the increased financing to come from Iraq. However, when the Arab Union
       broke up after the July 14 Iraqi revolution, it was not possible to cut these expenditures
       without reducing army manpower, which is something no government in Jordan can do.</p>
      <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0731"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> stated that, while we appreciated
       Jordan’s problem regarding the size of its military establishment, we thought these forces
       should be at the minimum possible level in relation to requirements.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister reiterated that it was not his Government’s intention to increase the
       size of the army, but that reduction is a problem. In the first place, the army is now at
       minimum strength. In the second place, up to 75 percent of military expenditures relate to
       troop support costs, which indirectly aid the economy. Any reduction in manpower would have
       to be accompanied by economic projects to provide employment for the demobilized soldiers.
       However, every endeavor would be made to hold to the present manpower level and a study of
       overall military expenditures had been initiated, which the Prime Minister hoped would result
       in some savings. Turning to his <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 60 budget, he pointed out
       that the military establishment’s requirements are $53.2 million, the increase (over <gloss
        target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 59) being necessitated by a build-up of the Air Force more than
       anything else. In terms of cash disbursements during the year, he expected military
       expenditures to be somewhat less than $53.2 million. Specifically, he requested that U.S.
       budget support for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 60 be at least at the level of the
       military budget in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 59, namely, $46.2 million. The present
       U.S. offer of $40.5 million is $5.6 million short of meeting Jordan’s minimum budget support
       needs.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that he understood the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was planning to provide some aid to Jordan during <gloss
        target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 60, and hoped that this aid would be helpful in meeting
       Jordan’s military budget problem. The Prime Minister replied that he hoped so, but that he
       did not want the army, which is the pillar supporting Jordan, to be paid for by scraping up
       piasters here and there. In any event, he wanted us to know where Jordan stood regarding U.S.
       budget support requirements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> said that we
       appreciated the Prime Minister’s statement of his position, and that it was in the context of
       helping his Government plan its <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 60 budget that we came
       forward with an offer of $40.5 million. At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> turned the discussion to military aid.<note n="3" xml:id="d396fn3">In
        the discussion of military aid, <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> indicated
        that, on the basis of General Risden’s recommendations and subject to Congressional
        authorization and appropriation of the necessary funds, the United States was prepared to
        initiate a modest program of military aid to Jordan. (Memorandum of conversation, March 24;
        Department of State, Central Files, 785.5–<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/3–2459) Prime
        Minister Rifai also discussed with <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> and the
        other U.S. officials the possibility that some <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960
        special assistance funds might become available to support Jordanian economic development.
        Some consideration was given to what might be possible through the Development Loan Fund and
        under Title II of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480, but <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
         >Rountree</persName> indicated that no definitive reply was possible at the time.

      <p>The President noted that King Hussein was scheduled to visit the Pentagon during the
       afternoon and assumed that in his briefing he would be told about recent scientific
       developments. The President then discussed several outer space experiments and their
       importance to scientific progress. The King obviously was greatly impressed.</p>
      <p>Responding to the President’s query, King Hussein said he planned, following his tour of
       the United States, to visit England for about ten days before returning to Jordan. He
       anticipated that he would be in Amman by the end of next month. Prime Minister Rifa’i said he
       would return to Amman very shortly and would endeavor to keep things under control while His
       Majesty was away.</p>
      <p>The President made complimentary remarks concerning King Hussein’s courageous attitude and
       leadership. He noted the similarity of views between Jordan and the United States on many
       questions and expressed the hope that we would continue to work together toward the
       resolution of problems which confront us. King Hussein acknowledged with gratitude the
       President’s comments and assured him that he and his government would work closely with us on
       common objectives. He noted that recent efforts had been made to bring about an Arab League
       meeting in Baghdad to reconcile the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iraq. The meeting
       was scheduled to be held at the Foreign Minister level at the end of this month. The
       President noted that it would be a fine thing if the Arab League could resolve this problem
       satisfactorily. Prime Minister Rifa’i agreed, but noted that when Jordan had great difficulty
       with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> no suggestion was made by the Arab League that
       it meet to resolve the dispute. In discussing the leadership of the Arab League, Mr.
        <persName>Rifa</persName>’i said the former Secretary-General, Azzam Pasha, talked too much,
       while the present head, Mr. <persName>Hassouna</persName>, “doesn’t talk”. He said <pb
        n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0733"/>the Arab League was not serving the purpose for which
       it was organized, in that it reflected merely the policies of one of the member states.</p>
      <p>The President expressed the hope that agreement could be achieved so that neither <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> would
       push each other too far. He feared that if <persName corresp="#p_QGAK1">Qassim</persName> was
       pushed too hard there would be no place for him to go except to the Soviets.</p>
      <p>The President inquired what might be a proper, specific program for rapprochement between
       the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iraq. He said that, for example, the occasion
       might present itself whereby he could make comments or suggestions if he felt they would be
       useful. King Hussein replied that the best formula would be full implementation of the Arab
       Resolution passed by the United Nations last year. However, that Resolution had been
       disregarded to the extent that it was now obsolete. What was needed was, in effect, another
       such resolution. In agreeing with the King, Prime Minister Rifa’i said the Arab League should
       support respect for the independence and integrity of the member states, non-interference in
       the internal affairs of each other, and joint efforts to promote the welfare of all Arab
       peoples.</p>
      <p>The President referred to a speech which he had made in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss> expressing the willingness of the United States to give assistance to an Arab
       plan for Middle East development.<note n="2" xml:id="d397fn2">See <ref target="#d269"
         >Document 269</ref>.</note> He felt that cooperative efforts along these lines might lead
       to a greater readiness among the Arab states to pull together against communism. He realized
       that the Arabs were concerned also with Israel, but the real danger to the Middle East was
       communist imperialism. He referred to his talk with King <persName corresp="#p_SAA5"
        >Saud</persName> in which he had stressed the danger of communism. King <persName
        corresp="#p_SAA5">Saud</persName> had replied that while he recognized that danger, Israel
       was a more immediate threat. That was before the recent developments in Iraq, and before the
       strength of communism in Iraq had become evident. The President hoped that present
       preoccupations with Israel would not be permitted to disrupt defense against communism.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i agreed and said that the smaller evils should be sacrificed if
       necessary to cope with larger ones.</p>
      <p>The President commented that our actions in the Middle East had demonstrated clearly our
       interest in helping the area. We had come to the assistance of Jordan when it needed our
       help. A particularly difficult aspect was presented, however, when our friends fought among
       themselves, as in the case of Israel and the Arab states.</p>
      <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0734"/>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i, in discussing the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, criticized the latter for using “Arab nationalism" to
       achieve his personal ambitions. He felt that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s
       policies had been detrimental and had upset peace and tranquility in the area which are
       urgently needed if the problems there were to be solved.</p>
      <p>The President commented upon the importance of making as much progress as possible in
       education, public health, etc. He asked what was being achieved in Jordan in these fields.
       The Prime Minister replied that Jordan had the highest percentage of literacy among the Arab
       states, except Lebanon. Seventy percent of the people could read and write. A number of
       hospitals had been constructed throughout the country in every district, and even in many
       villages.</p>
      <p>The President observed that doctors, who had the confidence of their patients not only in
       medical matters but generally in political affairs, could play an extremely important role in
       the development of healthy public attitudes. He asked where Jordanian doctors had been
       educated and what their political orientation generally was. The Prime Minister replied that
       most Jordanian doctors were educated at the American University in Beirut and in universities
       in Damascus and Cairo. He said that when the Jordanian Government was forced to suppress the
       communists, they found it necessary to arrest a large number of doctors. His government was
       trying now to keep to a minimum the number of Jordanians trained in the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
      <p>The President said he had always felt that the Arabs’ religion was so incompatible with
       atheistic communism that the communists could never get hold of the common people in Arab
       lands. He had thus been astonished at the strong support which communists seemed to have in
       such places as Baghdad and Damascus. He wondered how this was possible. He recalled that in
       Turkey communism was so unpopular that any single communist would receive very severe
       treatment if he were uncovered.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i replied that in general communism was extremely unpopular in Arab
       countries. Communists had, however, been able to capitalize on special situations. For
       example, in Iraq there had been a tremendous gap between the top and the bottom, with the
       masses of the people living in utter poverty but with some few in extreme wealth. He recalled
       that the Iraqis, during the discussion of the Iraq–Jordan union, had said that it would take
       twenty years at the present rate of progress in Iraq for the average villager in that country
       to reach the level of the average villager in Jordan. In Jordan there was virtually no class
       distinction, and thus communism had far less to work on.</p>
      <p>The President said he understood that the King and the Prime Minister had had discussions
       in the State Department of detailed problems, and thus he had not planned to go into details
       himself. The <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0735"/>Prime Minister responded that he had
       had excellent talks in the Department, and he merely wished to say that he would welcome the
       President’s support with respect to the various matters which the Jordanian representatives
       had raised.</p>
      <p>The President emphasized again that we had a great and special interest in the Middle East
       and wished to be helpful in resolving problems which the nations there had. At the same time,
       we had a broad responsibility which came from our firm belief in freedom and our knowledge
       that the destruction of freedom anywhere would affect our own. Thus our obligations were
       world-wide, and it was not always possible for us to do in any particular country or area
       everything we would like to do. The Prime Minister expressed appreciation for this situation,
       and said what he would like was to have in Jordan a “showcase" to demonstrate the advantages
       of cooperating with the free world with the United States as its leader.</p>
      <p>King Hussein said that it was his hope that he and his government would be able to do
       something for their people. He needed help but wished to be of minimum trouble to Jordan’s
       friends. He wanted to show all what friendship with the United States meant. He wanted to
       show stability, peace, and progress. He did not wish to live only for Jordan but wanted to do
       more for the area as a whole, which was facing communism and must adopt policies and programs
       to combat it. He would do the best he could. One of his greatest needs was with respect to
       his army. In two out of five regiments, for example, he now had pre-war tanks and other
       equipment. This was a bad situation, particularly since other states in the area had Joseph
       Stalin tanks “against us”.</p>
      <p>Without committing himself, the President said we would have to look into that
       situation.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister observed that communist supporters had their friends, and Jordan had its
       friends. The people were observing what the communists were doing for those cooperating with
       them, and would naturally draw comparisons with Jordan. He thought it would be unfortunate if
       the comparison should show that Jordan did not fare nearly so well.</p>
      <p>The President thought the Prime Minister had raised a very important question. The
       communists were undertaking an aggressive program designed to achieve international
       revolution, with domination from Moscow. In this program they could proceed as the attacker,
       others as the defenders. Our help and assistance must be given throughout the world. By their
       tactics the Soviets can be selective, as they were in Egypt and later in Iraq. Through these
       means they can take one-tenth of the resources which we use and can have tremendous effect
       since it takes far more to defend than to attack in isolated and selected places. However,
       the free world countries which oppose <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0736"/>communism have
       a bond of a common dedication to spiritual values. The Soviets do not have that. In this
       field they are extremely weak. We value human dignity and freedom, and are not slaves of a
       dictator of any kind. Thus we must present a common defense against communism.</p>
      <p>King Hussein again expressed his warm appreciation for his reception in the United States
       and the friendly conversations which he had had.</p>
      <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Following the meeting the President spoke privately to Mr.
        <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>, referring to the King’s comments regarding
       Jordan’s obsolete tanks. He mentioned the possibility of making some M–47’s available to
       Jordan, perhaps by writing down their value to a nominal sum. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
        >Rountree</persName> told the President that the Defense Department had prepared a list of
       military items, including twelve M–47 tanks, that we were prepared to give Jordan over a
       three-year period. The Jordanians were told generally what was on the list, a copy of which
       soon would be given them. They no doubt were not satisfied that twelve tanks were enough, and
       could be expected to raise the question again. The President thought that, if they did, we
       should give further thought to the matter.)</p>

      <p>In response to a request by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> for his views
       on the meaning of the term “Arab Nationalism” and the significance which the US should attach
       to the concept, Prime Minister Rifa’i noted that King Hussein would be discussing the
       Jordanian interpretation of “Arab Nationalism” in the speech which he was scheduled to give
       at the National Press Club luncheon the same day. The Prime Minister went on to say that the
       term “Arab Nationalism” was subject to a number of interpretations by different Arab nations
       and individuals. He asserted that in recent years this “attractive term” had been abused to
       some extent by ambitious leaders who sought to use it as a means of influencing the Arab
       peoples for selfish political ends. He said that some interpret “Arab Nationalism” as
       implying the union of the whole Arab World under one leader and the imposition of a certain
       type of government over the area. Others think that in view of the very different
       characteristics of the different Arab peoples, “Arab Nationalism” should more properly be
       interpreted as implying the creation of a loosely grouped community of Arab states, perhaps
       somewhat akin to the British Commonwealth of Nations. He concluded that the essential idea
       inherent in “Arab Nationalism” is the idea of unity.</p>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> commented that the United States is
       interested in doing what it can to alleviate tension in the Near East and bring about
       cooperation among the countries in the area. He wondered whether the US should be doing
       things in the political sense which it is not already doing.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i replied that although it was not up to Jordan to advise the US on its
       policy, he was very flattered that his opinion should be asked and would suggest a few things
       for the US to consider. He felt that the rivalry between individual leaders in the Arab World
       was a principal cause of present difficulties in the area but he believed it was only a
       question of time before things returned to a more normal state of affairs. Matters must be
       left for the Arabs themselves to sort out. The role of the US as the leader of the Free
       World, in his view, should be to strengthen friendly elements in the area. If the US was
       persuaded that certain leaders were exploiting the high interests of the Arab nation, it
       should refrain from extending the hand of support to these leaders.</p>
      <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>’s question as to what
       importance he attached to the current meeting of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_CGF2"
        >Chehab</persName> of Lebanon and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of the
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the Prime Minister replied that he did not attach great
       importance to this meeting. He felt that Lebanon’s principal motivation in seeking to smooth
       its relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was economic, since Lebanon is
       heavily dependent on income from transit trade through the Port of Beirut, from tourism and
       from exports of apples and citrus fruits. The country was extremely vulnerable to <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and particularly Syrian, economic pressure.</p>
      <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0738"/>
      <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> commented that in our view the present
       situation in the Near East gives more hope of improvement than at any time in the recent
       past. It was our feeling that the overall interest of the people of the area and the Free
       World as a whole might best be served if every possible effort were made by Jordan as well as
       Lebanon to bring about an improvement in relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>. We were not suggesting humiliating concessions, but felt that, particularly in
       view of the Iraqi situation and the Communist threat, now is the best time to try to improve
       relations among the Arab States.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Rifa’i responded that he did not wish to give the impression that the
       Jordanians would not be the happiest of persons to see good relations established among the
       Arab states. He said that, despite the bitter and extremely personal attacks in the past
       against King Hussein and his own person, Jordan was ready to forget the past and open a new
       page in its relations with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He observed, however,
       that despite the young King’s nobility in disregarding the unjust attacks upon him, there
       were two matters which His Majesty could not easily forget. The Prime Minister wished for
       some gesture from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to help him in his advocacy of
       improved relations between the two countries. The two matters which still rancored were: 1)
       the attack by Syrian fighter planes on His Majesty’s aircraft last fall and 2) activities
       against the present government of Jordan by former Jordanian nationals resident in the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. With regard to the first, the Jordan government felt that
       someone should come from Cairo to express official regret over the unwarranted attack upon
       His Majesty’s person. With regard to the political émigrés in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
        >UAR</gloss>, they had all been sentenced in Jordan courts and deprived of Jordanian
       nationality. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> should either surrender these people
       under the terms of the extradition treaty in force between the two countries or should at
       least force them to cease all political activity against Jordan. Unless these minimum
       gestures were made, he did not see how an improvement in relations could be brought about.
       The Jordanians, and particularly the young King, could not be expected to go humbly to hail
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as the Lord of the Arab World.</p>
      <p>The Acting Secretary, who joined the meeting toward its close, closed the session with an
       expression of the real satisfaction with which the visit of His Majesty and his counselors
       had been received. He asked that Mr. <persName>Rifa</persName>’i convey to the King how much
       we had been honored and pleased by his presence among us and our hope that he felt the
       genuine warmth of his welcome.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister responded by thanking the Acting Secretary for his kind words and
       apologized for His Majesty’s absence from the final meeting. He assured the Acting Secretary
       that His Majesty and all the members of his party had been overwhelmed by the warmth and
       generosity of the hospitality which had been extended to them.</p>

         ><hi rend="italic">April 2, 1959</hi></date>.</dateline>
      <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ken</hi>: With King Hussein’s visit to Washington now a matter of
       history, I thought it might be useful to apprise you informally of some of the background
       developments connected with his trip.</p>
      <p>As far as we can determine, all has gone well and there have been until now no major
       hitches. Apparently His Majesty enjoyed his brief stay in Hawaii, although Hawaiian
       hospitality was so extensive that His Majesty felt called upon to cancel a hurried air trip
       around the Islands. Our State Department representative at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
        >CINCPAC</gloss> reports that our military authorities in Hawaii as well as the Governor
       spared no effort to make the King happy.</p>
      <p>Although we and probably even the Jordanians may have had some forebodings as to the
       official discussions which would be held in Washington, our talks with the Jordanians were
       surprisingly cordial and smooth. You will be receiving copies of the various memoranda of
       conversation which deal with the substance of the talks. The King himself participated only
       in the discussion with the President and in the initial talk with Acting Secretary <persName
        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>. In the other discussions at the Department
        <persName>Samir el-Rifa</persName>’i ably expressed Jordanian views. There was common
       agreement that we had not come together to conduct any negotiations and this helped to clear
       the air. In our discussions of our over-all assistance to Jordan there was virtually nothing
       new. We were pleased to be able to indicate that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loan
       for the phosphate company was approved in principle. Perhaps of greatest interest to the
       Jordanians was the revelation that we are prepared to follow up the Risden recommendations
       with a modest three-year military assistance program. Assistant Secretary of Defense Irwin
       orally conveyed the rough outlines of what we proposed to do by way of military aid but we
       avoided disclosing any priorities, time schedule, or any monetary implications. We hope to
       convey to the Jordanians in writing at a later date more precise information concerning our
       military assistance intentions but in general believe that much of the detail will have to be
       worked out through continuing consultations. What seemed to please the Jordanians more than
       anything else was the fact, subject to Congressional appropriations, that we are prepared to
       commit ourselves to a program of three years’ duration.</p>
      <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0740"/>
      <p>In his public appearances while in Washington, His Majesty conducted himself extremely
       well. He spoke at the National Press Club and made a TV appearance on “Face the Nation”. In
       both he produced highly diplomatic answers despite some very loaded questions. As you can
       imagine, there were quite a number of questions about the Arab-Israeli issue. The King
       answered most of them by resorting to a simple formula that it behooves the United Nations to
       find a “just solution" to this question. No amount of badgering moved him very far from this
       safe line. Other questions centered largely on general Middle East matters such as Iraq and
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. Your coaching and our own may have done some
       good but His Majesty found it difficult to avoid occasionally thinly veiled criticism of
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. For example, when asked about Iraq, his usual
       reply was that to appraise the Iraqi situation properly one must place it in a general area
       framework. He would then note that “certain governments” allowed communism to enter into the
       Arab world by accepting aid from the Soviets and in other ways cooperating with the Communist
       bloc. He would note that Jordan was first among those who recognized the Communist threat and
       inveighed against it. For their efforts, the Jordanians (the King) were violently attacked.
       Now these “certain governments” are preaching the same message which caused Jordan to be
       subjected to such heavy criticism. The newsmen, of course, found no difficulty in identifying
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as the primary target for the King’s critical
       remarks.</p>
      <p>Publicity on the King’s visit has been unusually good. Even while he was in Washington and
       New York newspapers published pictures about his visit. All during his Washington stay,
       Washington and New York newspapers gave him a remarkable amount of space, particularly in the
       society columns. Even since his departure from Washington our papers have been covering quite
       adequately his visits to Annapolis, Norfolk, Williamsburg, and Knoxville. One of the reasons
       for this unusual amount of publicity no doubt is the fact that Americans are generally
       attracted by a youthful monarch. In addition, of course, many have heard of his great courage
       during the crisis of last summer. There also, of course, may be considerable interest in him
       as a potential rival in the Arab world to President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> of the United Arab Republic.</p>
      <p>As far as his post-Washington tour is concerned, it apparently is going along
       satisfactorily. However, the King has been registering some complaints that the schedule is
       too crowded. Apparently he had in mind primarily a vacation tour with plenty of relaxation.
       In fact, the tour is not as crowded as that of most official visitors. [<hi rend="italic">10
        lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Also responsible undoubtedly is the fact that
       His Majesty’s personal habits have been to stay up late in talking sessions with his cronies
       and to rise late in the mornings. Today he is moving on to California where there are at
       least three nights free as well as all <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0741"/>day Sunday.
       We would hope that in California his spirits will improve. Actually, almost all the places
       included on the King’s itinerary were those which he had suggested to you in Amman. Perhaps
       he did not realize at that time that visiting these various points of interest would sharply
       curtail time available for complete relaxation.</p>
      <p>In your recent telegrams there has been considerable emphasis on the point that unless
       Rifa’i and the King come back with significant sums of money there may be political changes
       in Jordan. As you know, no significant additions have been made to our Jordanian assistance
       program as a result of this visit. Our impression, however, is that both the King and Rifa’i
       left Washington far from being displeased. On the contrary, they both seemed very happy. The
       impression given is that more important than actual quantities of assistance was the success
       which they achieved in selling themselves as upstanding friends of the West, deserving of
       full understanding and respect. The most friendly attention and publicity which they received
       undoubtedly gave them great personal satisfaction and encouragement. We would hope that this
       satisfaction will tide them over in the months ahead and encourage them to constructive
       leadership wherein the quantities of American assistance would be placed in proper
       perspective.</p>
      <p>All in all, we feel the King’s trip was a success. We believe it is important that the
       Jordanians also have the same feeling and trust that in your discussions with the Jordanians
       you will be able to encourage them to consider the trip as having been successful. The
       psychological element is always an important factor and in this case it would be well if the
       Jordanians generally reached the conclusion that the visit to Washington by the King and the
       Prime Minister was highly worthwhile.</p>
      <p>In closing, let me thank you for the fine work which you and your associates did in
       providing us with advance information which contributed significantly to the visit’s success.
       We will, of course, be interested in Jordanian reactions as you report them to us in the
       weeks ahead.</p>
      <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

        at home and abroad, stressed need for “even greater cooperation between US and Jordan in

        He was well aware many persons considered him be strongly pro-British even inferred that as
        Prime Minister he would welcome a return to modified Glubb Pasha era. This was not true.
        Jordan unlike other Arab States and certain Arab leaders has never tried play East off
        against West. Its record is 100% for the free world. The recognized leader of the free world
        is the US, its greatest ally is the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> the preference be only
        natural Jordan should enjoy close relations with both, however, he personally leaned more
        toward US because in dark days following Glubb Pasha ouster termination treaty with <gloss

        US role during that crucial period and substantial assistance since that time he wanted it
        clearly understood he was <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0743"/>neither pro-American or
        pro-British but only pro-Jordanian. I remarked jokingly that he had made no mention being
         pro-<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as some people said he was (this was
        designed draw him out on most important foreign policy subject). <persName
         corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> replied he recognized desirability united front
        among member Arab States but this could only be achieved if all those concerned really
        wanted to cooperate. He then launched into impassioned speech extolling virtues King
        Hussein, his destiny as future leader Arab anti-Communist world, concluded by saying “I am
        only the shadow. King is the power, no one but the King can lead, all others must follow.”
        He replied “<persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is a snake who has bitten our
        King, who in turn cracked <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s head; until both

       <item>Prime Minister said as his friend he wanted me know something concerning reasons which
        influenced choice certain Cabinet Ministers. Minister Interior <persName>Wasfi
         Mirza</persName> had been selected because he is Turk (Embassy records him Circassian),
        extremely wealthy therefore above bribery, he has no blood relatives in Jordan (his sister
        however is married to Under Secretary Minister Finance Munirar-Rifai, brother former Prime
        Minister), “will follow without question wishes His Majesty King Hussein.” Anwar Nashashibi
        was chosen for Defense Minister because he is West Banker (Jerusalem) whose appointment will
        tend silence charges East Bank Beduins completely control military. I pointed out Nashashibi
        was also designated Minister Development and Reconstruction which seemed to me like heavy
        load for one man. Prime Minister put his hand on my arm said “my good friend we both know
        except for period when Rifai took over Defense portfolio Defense Minister was mere
        figurehead with all important decisions made by C-in-C Armed Forces. This is the way it will
        be from now on with King himself keeping in close touch on defense matters.” Re Foreign
        Minister, <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> said first choice was Musa Alami
        but unfortunately he was difficult man pin down, furthermore at present time he was in US.
        Decision has been reached Prime Minister will hold both portfolios time being. If Musa Alami
        accepts appointment <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> will release it, if not
        he will continue act dual capacity foreseeable future.</item>
       <label>(C)</label>
       <item>I told Prime Minister in view number of problems involving economic assistance we were
        very much interested in knowing who he intended appoint as Vice-President Jordan Development
        Board and when. He said having held that post himself he recognizes its importance therefore
        in order there should be no slowdown in Board’s operations he had directed the new Minister
        of Economy Khulusy Al-Khairy temporarily assume responsibility its operations. In a few days
        he hopes have chosen new Vice-President replacing Anastas Hananiya now Minister of Justice
        and Communications. He intends appoint someone who is able, energetic and with whom US
        officials will find it easy to work. He said when appointment finalized he will invite

       <item>I took opportunity clarify as part new Prime Minister’s indoctrination subject US
        budgetary aid pointing out $10 million already given <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss>
        would be last which could be expected until after US <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–60
        budget passed by Congress which in practical terms meant no more US money before late August
        or September. <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> confessed he is deeply
        concerned over budget as a whole and particularly over certain supplementary requests which
        he understands will shortly be brought forth by various government departments particularly
        Defense. He said he intends to rely very heavily on his personal friend Budget Director Adib
        for whose professional competency he has great respect. I took occasion to point out
        necessity that ARMA Colonel Delaney be provided as soon as possible with a complete
        breakdown of the military sector of the budget in order that Washington might be apprised of
        the exact status and future requirements of the Jordan Armed Forces. I said Colonel Delaney
        in his dual capacity as Military Assistance Advisor as well as Military Attaché needed this
        detailed breakdown at the earliest possible moment to ensure that Jordan’s needs might be
        given the proper consideration by the military in Washington.</item>
      </list>
      <p>I said our <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> people were interested in knowing whether
       or not Abdul Munim Ar-Rifai, Director National Guidance, would remain on since they had now
       reached the point in working out a program with him where such information was essential.
        <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> said he considers Munim Ar-Rifai as his own
       brother and has asked him if he would be willing to continue in his present post not only
       because of the specific need in the propaganda field but equally as much in the role of
       foreign affairs advisor. Prime Minister explained that Rifai as Jordan’s most experienced
       diplomat cannot be spared particularly at a time when the Foreign Ministry is vacant or may
       possibly be filled by a completely inexperienced person. It is <persName corresp="#p_Majali1"
        >Majali</persName>’s intention to send Rifai as Jordan’s representative to any international
       conferences which may come up in the near future. He said Munim Rifai has agreed to stay
       on.</p>
      <p>I thanked Prime Minister for his consideration in giving me so much of his time when I knew
       there were such heavy demands on him. As he walked me to the car he said “I want you to know
       that you may call me at any hour day or night on any subject on which you believe I may have
       information that will advance the mutual interests of our two countries.” I thanked him once
       again for his generous offer pointing out that I would soon be leaving Jordan and I

       this afternoon said King wished to see me as soon as possible. On arrival at Palace I found
       usually crowded reception room deserted except for Chief of Protocol who took me immediately
       to King.</p>
      <p>Hussein opened conversation by saying he wished have “one of our informal talks in order he
       could tell me something concerning composition new government”. He said government former
       Prime Minister Rifai had with help army and police brought Jordan to a state of stability
       which permitted greater freedom of action in international field. In selecting new Cabinet
       greatest stress had been laid on personal and professional integrity, loyalty, willingness to
       work as a team submerging personal ideas and opinions to “higher authorities” (meaning Palace
       and/or army).</p>
      <p>King told me he had ordered study policies and programs all Ministries with particular
       attention to their effect on already unbalanced budget. I took opportunity point out to King
       as I had earlier to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> fact
        <gloss target="#t_HKJ1">HKJ</gloss> had already received initial $10 million installment for
        <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>–60 could not expect any further US budgetary support
       payments before end of summer. King said he had issued orders budget must be “cut to bone”,
       however this means not reduce effectiveness armed forces.</p>
      <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0746"/>
      <p>King proceeded branch out into discussion foreign affairs saying Rifai government had shown
       lack imagination foresight in fields international affairs with result Jordan had failed
       assume its proper role leadership free Arab States. He said for more than two years Jordan
       had stood firm against Communist penetration Middle East while <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> during same period had been ally of Russia playing East against West in
       bid dominate Arab world. He (Hussein) had been special target <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>’s attacks but despite everything he (<persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>) could do Jordan stood like a rock. Now belatedly <persName

       14 revolution has suddenly become violently anti-Communist demanding all other Arab States
       recognize him as their leader in fight against Red Menace. Hussein emphasized Jordan will
       never accept <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> whether he poses as anti-Communist
       or reveals himself in his true light as a dictator bent on creating an Arab empire. I pointed
       out regardless <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s motives there was no
       gain-saying he had “pulled out all stops” in his attacks on Communists both Soviets and

      <p>2368. Following advice afternoon 14th Hussein wished see me immediately, I spent hour and
       quarter in first tour d’horizon with King.</p>
      <p>Obvious King had received report from <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> of
       his visit with <persName corresp="#p_WTK1">Wright</persName> and me 13th.<note n="2"
        xml:id="d402fn2"><persName corresp="#p_MST1">Mills</persName> reported on this meeting,
        which was similarly an initial tour d’horizon, in telegram 2365 from Amman, May 14. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 785.00/5–1459; included in the microfiche supplement)</note> In
       view this assumption I launched into what I believed was most on King’s mind, namely question
       of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. I drew on extremely helpful appraisal given
       me by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> in conversation about
       April 20 stating among other things US extremely pleased that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> had come to realize Communism and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       principal menace to Mid East today and that we encouraged <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> in maintaining this stand.</p>
      <p>Hussein spoke at length of past efforts <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to
       undermine governments in other Arab States including Jordan and asked several times whether
       we convinced we could trust <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. I replied we could
       trust <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to follow policy he considered in his own
       best interests, as well as in interest of Arab world as he sees it, and we would spare no
       effort to reinforce and maintain <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s present
       attitude towards Communism and Soviet Union. Hussein replied difficult believe <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> really opposed to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
       since he continues receive Soviet economic aid and permit Soviet technicians roam freely in
       Egypt and Syria.</p>
      <p>Hussein stated he has solid information <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       arming tribesmen in Syria for incursion into Iraq. At end of conversation he translated
       report he had received from Beirut that incursion into Kirkuk area with participation Iranian
       tribesmen being planned and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had requested USG to deposit
       in Syrian banks $500 million to finance such effort and USG favorable. I replied USG has no
       such massive sums available without going to Congress and such statement to my mind suggested
       spurious character such report. King said story undoubtedly will be carried on Baghdad radio
       in day or two.</p>
      <p>I told Hussein I believed Iraq situation was under constant review by USG and I could not
       anticipate what lies ahead. I believed at moment US would do everything possible to
       discourage “adventures” by neighboring states. I could conceive of situation deteriorating to
        <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0748"/>point where Iraqi Communists perhaps with Soviet
       assistance set up Soviet satellite regime either open or disguised, and if this occurred US
       would have to decide what should be done. But at moment seemed to me any military adventures
       by Iraq’s neighbors would be unfortunate in extreme. Tenure of Hussein’s comment was that
        <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was preparing just such a military adventure.</p>
      <p>Apparent Hussein convinced <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> largely
       responsible for bringing about July 14 overthrow in Iraq and intended doing same in Jordan. I
       was able to tell King that our Ambassador in Cairo convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> at present time wish see
       maintenance stability in Jordan. I said I also learned from Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>
       <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> attempting mend fences with Arab countries with
       which relations have been bad, such as Sudan and Tunisia, but supposed no approaches made to
       Jordan. King said <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had made approaches. But
       question is one of principle and again asked how we could trust <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName>. I replied we often had to take foreign leaders as we find them and if
       even belatedly they adopt policies considered helpful for survival free world, then we forget
       past and cooperate in new situation.</p>
      <p>King most friendly and invited see him at any time. I of course told him I would be
       available whenever he wished see me.</p>
      <p>As I was leaving from call on Turkish Ambassador morning 14th (during which I had voiced
       “no adventure" theme), latter stated I should not be worried by what King had said to Wright

       <item>Objectives of the United States in Jordan and How to Achieve Them</item>
      </list>
      <p>Reference is made to the Department’s Circular Telegram No. 149 of August 19, 1959, which
       notes my responsibility and authority with respect to the mutual security and related
       programs of the United States in Jordan, and requests my analysis of the objectives of the
       United States in Jordan and the role of both US and non-US programs in achieving them in
       Fiscal Year 1961.</p>
      <p>The Department, and other interested governmental agencies in Washington, have voluminous
       background on developments in Jordan since 1956–57 when the Jordanian Government dismissed
       Glubb Pasha</p>
      <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0751"/>
      <p>and terminated the 1946 Treaty with the United Kingdom (under which Transjordan had
       achieved full sovereignty) with the result that shortly thereafter the subsidy which the
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> annually had paid Transjordan (and later Jordan) in ever
       increasing volume was withdrawn. Jordan went from crisis to crisis from 1956 to the current
       year, and, just as it had done in Greece and Turkey as well as in numerous other parts of the
       world, the US stepped in financially to prevent collapse and perhaps chaos in Jordan which
       could have brought on an area-wide crisis the consequences of which could well have been
       disastrous not only for Jordan but for the region as a whole. Our hope that Iraq might take
       on some of the financial burden of supporting Jordan, which was high when the Arab Union of
       Jordan and Iraq was established early in 1958, was dashed to the ground when the Union fell
       apart with the July 14, 1958 Iraqi Revolution. To date no possibility of finding another
       solution to the problem of assistance to Jordan has presented itself, nor have we been able
       to think up an alternative to the present arrangement towards which we can gradually
       work.</p>
      <p>Absorption of Jordan into the United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria is not a practical
       possibility at the present time; it would be resisted by the dominant elements in Jordan, and
       probably is not currently desired by President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
       since one consequence probably would be that large scale assistance from the US and the
        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to Jordan would be withdrawn or greatly diminished. In
       fact from the standpoint of the US the reduction in such assistance would be about the only
       recommendation of such a development. The Egyptians no doubt realize that in these
       circumstances their absorption of Jordan would rapidly bring on the economic collapse of the
       country, and Egypt would be faced with having on its hands a million persons (a million and a
       half including the Arab refugees) expecting better, not worse, times, with Egypt quite
       incapable of satisfying such aspirations.</p>
      <p>Even should the Egyptians revert to the ambition they had in 1957–58 of absorbing Jordan,
       it could not be accomplished except by military force or subversion, and either course could
       quite easily be taken by Israel as a signal to achieve the long-held Zionist ambition of
       grabbing the part of Palestine now in Jordan and perhaps old Transjordan as well. (This was
       what the more extreme Zionists demanded in 1919 and still demand.) Since Israel would wish
       the land without the people, in order that it could be populated by Jews from Eastern Europe,
       Africa and Asia, such a step by Israel would undoubtedly lead to war with the whole Arab
       world and perhaps part of the Muslim non-Arab world as well. None of the Arab states are in a
       mood or position to absorb into their economic life the million Arab refugees now living
       largely in Jordan, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip upon the
       bounty of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. To have half of them, as well as a million
       more Jordanians (half Palestinians and half Transjordanians), or even</p>
      <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0752"/>
      <p>50 percent of this number if the Transjordanians were not disturbed, uprooted would be a
       major tragedy which the rest of the Arab world simply could not tolerate. If the Free World
       did not prevent such a tragedy the Arab countries could be expected to seek the support of
       the Communist World.</p>
      <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">To Summarize:</hi>
       <list>
        <item>1. A partial solution of the problem presented by Jordan by the establishment of the
         Arab Union of Jordan and Iraq failed and there is no chance that it can be revived in the
         foreseeable future. As conditions are now in Iraq few Jordanians could be found who would
         favor such a union.</item>
        <item>2. Union with the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> of Egypt and Syria is not
         believed to be desired by Egypt because of the dire economic consequences and because, if
         forced by subversion or invasion, it could easily lead Israel to make a grab at the West
         Bank (Arab Palestine) if not at all of Jordan. If Israel succeeded the proportions of the
         Arab refugee problem could be doubled, that is, to the half million Arab refugees outside
         Jordan would be added up to all the population of Jordan of a million and a half, most of
         whom would prefer becoming refugees to living as a partly disenfranchised alien element in
         Israel, and Israel would not want them. Such an aggression by Israel, however, probably
         would set off an Arab–Israel war (and perhaps a Muslim–Israel war) which might lead to a
         Third World War.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>This boils down to the fact that for the time being there is no real alternative to a
       continuation of the maintenance of Jordan as it is and this is possible only with continued
       assistance from the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
      <p>In the meantime the US should continue to do what it can, with whatever help can be given
       by others such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       technical assistance, and West Germany, to assist the Jordanians in developing their economic
       and human resources in order that the growing population can be provided with at least a
       tolerable life. Without this there could easily be chaos, intervention and disaster. With
       luck over a period of time such assistance could mean that Jordan could absorb some of its
       half million Arab refugees in its gradually expanded economy. Whether the rate of such
       absorption of refugees can equal or exceed the rate of natural increase among them is an open
       question. There are no industrial projects in sight which could absorb refugee or other labor
       on a large scale. Small scale undertakings certainly help by preventing the situation from
       becoming worse and should be encouraged. But it is not possible to have great optimism that
       half a million refugees who fled from their homes in what is now Israel eleven years ago, and
       their children, can be absorbed by Jordan to any significant extent at least in anything
       other than the very long run.</p>
      <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0753"/>
      <p>If Israel could be induced to apply a major portion or at least some of the compensation
       payments it is receiving from West Germany, as well as other resources, to recompensing the
       Arab refugees in Jordan for their properties in Israel, many of which are providing incomes
       and amenities such as housing for Israeli citizens, then some of the refugees could use such
       stakes to try to make a new life for themselves, either in Jordan or elsewhere. There has
       been little indication that Israel intends to make such reparation now or in the future. Yet
       without it the refugees in Jordan (and elsewhere) remain a millstone around the necks of the
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Jordan. They form an excessive supply of labor which
       forces down wages in Jordan; they form a viper’s nest of discontent and hatred which, because
       of their susceptibility to extremists, is a constant danger to the security of the Jordanian
       Government.</p>
      <p>Past events have shown that as long as this one-third of the citizens of Jordan remain in
       their current miserable and hopeless state, Jordan must maintain very strong security forces
       to keep on top of the situation. Similarly the Jordanians are convinced that their regular
       military forces must be strong enough, as at present, to deter an aggression from Israel for
       up to five days to permit international machinery to operate and stop an aggression. In the
       past what Israel has seized it has held (regardless of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       resolutions); at least this was the case with respect to Israeli seizures of Arab occupied
       and allotted Palestinian territory during the period between the two armistices of 1948 and
       1949. Jordan cannot hope to have military forces which could be a serious threat to Israel or
       to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. It insists, however, on having forces sufficient
       to hold up an invasion from Israel (or the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>) for a few
       days until the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can act. If it were too weak to do this,
       Jordanians are convinced that sooner or later Israel, flouting the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
        >UN</gloss>, would move to seize more of Arab Palestine which now is part of Jordan.</p>
      <p>Such a situation could be greatly relaxed if Israel would abandon its policy of the
       “ingathering of the Diaspora” under which it invites persons of the Jewish faith from all
       over the world to come to Israel as immigrants. Jordanians, and many others, are convinced
       that the absorptive capacity for immigrants of the present territory of Israel must be
       reaching the saturation point, even if the figure quoted by the Hammarskjold Report<note
        n="3" xml:id="d404fn3">On June 15, 1959, <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
        Secretary-General Hammarskjold submitted to the General Assembly a report entitled
        “Proposals for the Continuance of United Nations Assistance to Palestine Refugees.” (U.N.
        doc. A/4121; printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
         1959,</hi> pp. 1033–1041)</note> of an $8, 000 investment in creating each immigrant job is
       increased; as Jordanians see it, this inevitably will mean that Israel eventually will try to
       seize more territory, and the territory <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0754"/>most coveted
       by Israel is that of Arab Palestine now in Jordan.<note n="4" xml:id="d404fn4">A recent
        American visitor to Jordan told me that some close Jewish friends of his, American citizens
        (who are reasonable in most things), told him with obvious sincerity that the Jewish people
        have a covenant with Jehovah under which all of the territory of present day Jordan was
        promised to the Jews. These otherwise kindly American Jews apparently are totally
        indifferent to what becomes of the present Arab occupants of Jordan. Palestinian Jordanians
        have heard such assertions for the last 40 years and know they are believed. [Footnote in
        the source text.]</note> So Jordan must maintain security and military forces of at least an
       insurance character. That is what they, and we, believe Jordan now has. We have made it
       perfectly clear that the Jordanian military and security forces cannot be expanded beyond the
       present level without greater budgetary support which will not come from us. The Jordanians
       reluctantly are attempting to reduce their military forces, having no choice in the matter;
       but they insist that the efficiency of their insurance military force must be improved if
       this can be accomplished without increasing the cost of such forces to the operating
       budget.</p>
      <p>Approximately half the budgetary expenditures of the Kingdom of Jordan come from the budget
       support accorded by the US and, to a much lesser extent, by the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss>. By coincidence this is approximately the figure of the cost of the security and
       military forces of Jordan. Jordan, the US and Britain cannot be happy over this situation. It
       is, however, justified as peace insurance. In essence the very large sums the US contributes
       to such countries as Pakistan, Iran, and Laos can be and probably are justified also as peace
       insurance. It is unlikely that the forces of any of those countries would play any important
       part in a Third World War. Yet they are justified as war deterrents. At very much smaller
       cost the US similarly is paying a war deterrent insurance premium in the form of its
       budgetary support to Jordan. The length of time such peace insurance will be necessary in
       Jordan, as in Iran, Pakistan and Laos, depends on forces operating on a much larger stage
       than the countries themselves. Because two of them (Iran and Laos) have powerful and dynamic
       Communist states as neighbors, and threats from these neighbors are periodic, whatever
       assistance is needed can be provided by the US without much complaint on the part of the
       American taxpayer and Congress. Jordan is in a situation more akin to that of Pakistan. The
       latter is threatened by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> only indirectly, because
       Afghanistan is still something of a buffer. Also Pakistan has felt the threats of India, in
       the past, much more than the threat of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the US
       is a friend of India and is helping it on a massive scale. Similarly the threat to Jordan
       from Communism is not direct, although it is conceivable this situation might change should
       Iraq fall under Communist sway. Currently the threat to Jordan is from Israel, a country
       which is friendly to the US and which the US has helped on a massive scale many times as
       great as the assistance given <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0755"/>Jordan. Israel also
       receives massive assistance from world Jewry, some elements of which try, openly or covertly,
       to discourage the provision by the US of assistance to the dissatisfied Arab neighbors of
       Israel, including Jordan. A great deal of indirect assistance is provided to Israel by the US
       Government by means of the tax-free status that is granted to the United Jewish Appeal.</p>
      <p>I believe that the above situation is thoroughly understood by those with accurate
       knowledge in the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
        >ICA</gloss>. I do not believe that the general public in the United States, or most of the
       Congress, have any idea of the situation in which Jordan finds itself and the need of
       American assistance to Jordan as peace insurance.</p>
      <p>Most of this peace insurance premium for Jordan for the current Jordan Fiscal Year (ending
       March 31, 1960) consists of $40.5 million in budget support. During the visit to Washington
       in March, 1959, of King Hussein, his then Prime Minister, and other Ministers (including the
       present Prime Minister), the Jordanians made an effort to obtain a pledge that budgetary
       assistance on this (or if possible a greater) scale would be forthcoming for a considerable
       period of time; they requested such an assurance for a period of seven years. The Secretary
       of State (then Acting) explained that under the American system financial pledges cannot be
       made for future periods since the Congress alone has authority to appropriate money and it
       does so only on an annual basis. The Secretary asked the Jordanians to take what we have and
       are doing as an earnest that we would continue to assist on about the same level in the
       future, given the approval of the Congress. The Jordanians consider that this was a
       conditional pledge, conditional on Congressional appropriations. Since I was present at this
       meeting, I believe I can speak with some degree of knowledge of the nature of the conditional
       pledge and how it was understood by the Jordanians.</p>
      <p>I consider that a peace insurance premium of approximately the same size will have to be
       paid to Jordan in its fiscal year starting April 1, 1960. I say this because I do not foresee
       any fundamental change in the Jordanian or the regional situation in the near future, that is
       between now and next April, or between next April and April 1961. If there are fundamental
       changes, then the situation will have to be reappraised. Such a change could conceivably be a
       final solution of the Palestine problem with a substitution for the uneasy armistices between
       Israel and its Arab neighbors (<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Jordan and Lebanon) of a
       final peace. As I see the present situation, I do not believe Israel is at present ready to
       pay the price for peace and I do not believe the US or the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
       are willing to bring pressure on Israel to do so.</p>
      <p>In my opinion the price Israel would have to pay for peace with its Arab neighbors at a
       minimum would include the following: <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0756"/>
       <list>
        <label>(1)</label>
        <item>Recognition that Arab refugees have the right to return to Israel and be given back
         their homes and properties. No Jordanian I have talked with thinks many of the Arab
         refugees in Jordan would return, and they believe that most who did would leave again as
         soon as they could sell their properties and arrange for the transfer abroad of these
         assets.</item>
        <label>(2)</label>
        <item>Fair compensation for the properties of the Arab refugees who do not return.</item>
        <label>(3)</label>
        <item>Abandonment by Israel of the policy of the ingathering of the Diaspora so that its
         Arab neighbors, particularly Jordan, could breathe freely again and not live night and day
         under what they believe to be the threat that Israel is just waiting for an opportunity to
         seize Arab Palestine and drive out the Arabs now fully occupying this area.</item>
        <label>(4)</label>
        <item>Rectification of frontiers so that West Jordan (Palestinian) villagers who still have
         their homes in Jordan (and so are not technically refugees and thus receive little
         assistance from <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>) would have returned to them their
         farms adjoining their homes and thus once more have a means of earning their
         livelihood.</item>
       </list></p>
      <p>Peace would have many advantages for Israel. Not only would the boycott of the Arab
       countries be lifted, but Israel could expect to find a market for its agricultural and
       industrial products in the neighboring Arab countries, particularly unindustrialized (and
       perhaps unindustrializable) Jordan. Haifa and Jaffa would again become <hi rend="italic"
        >entrepôts</hi> for Jordan to the benefit of both Israel and Jordan.</p>
      <p>In my opinion if Israel does not make peace with its Arab neighbors, in the long run,
       perhaps 50 years, it is doomed as an independent state. It will be no more lasting than the
       Latin (Crusader) Kingdom of Jerusalem, and perhaps less so. Its Arab neighbors are acquiring
       skills rapidly, just as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist China, and India
       are rapidly acquiring skills. Some day the Arab countries, or a considerable number of them,
       will be united politically. The Arabs for some time to come will be winning the battle of the
       cradle since their families, even among the educated, are much larger than those of the
       Israelis, at least those from Europe.</p>
      <p>I believe that a very large number of influential Jordanians would be willing to accept the
       existence of the State of Israel if the latter is willing, or is successfully urged
       particularly by the US, to pay the price of peace somewhat as outlined above. If this does
       not occur, the US, as I see it, has little choice but to continue paying the peace insurance
       premium to Jordan for an indefinite period.</p>
      <p>I and other Embassy officers have reviewed with <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
       >USOM</gloss>/Jordan officials the proposed <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Jordan
       program for fiscal year 1961 recently sent to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. We believe
       that in Jordan, as in other countries, there have been some false starts in the past. At
       present the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Jordan Director and his staff are doing
       their best to rectify any mistakes that have been made. They also are trying to concentrate
       on projects of the highest priority and eliminate or scale down projects <pb n="725"
        xml:id="pg_725" facs="0757"/>which they, and the Jordanians, consider of lesser utility.
       They have the full support of myself and other Embassy officers in this endeavor. We have
       gone over the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–1961 program and approve it.</p>
      <p>There are other things which we can and should do when plans have been worked out. Jordan
       needs additional help in education. The King, the Prime Minister and the Minister of
       Education are now considering ways and means of reorienting the educational system so that
       the high schools of the country will not turn out 5, 000 plus graduates each year whose
       training is entirely academic while the job openings for people with such training, now and
       for some years to come, cannot be expected to exceed 500 per year. When plans mature Jordan
       will ask us for and should receive help in changing the high school curriculum to emphasize
       practical skills.</p>
      <p>In ten years this situation may change as the country develops its resources. Jordan simply
       cannot afford, however, to build up a backlog of 50, 000 or more academically educated young
       men (and women) who have no opportunity of earning a living. (These figures do not include
       the high school graduates from the refugee camps who, at least, have food and shelter while
       unsuccessfully seeking employment.) This group of educated unemployed dogs the Ministers in
       charge of many of the projects in which <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> is involved.
       The Jordanian Ministers cannot close their eyes to this problem. Tremendous pressures are
       brought on them to give jobs, any jobs. This group is like quicksilver, pushed back here only
       to push out there. The greatest pressure is brought on the Minister of Public Works and,
       unless he wishes to see educated young men (non-refugees) starve, or secretly join extremist
       (perhaps Communist) ranks, he must find something to keep body and soul together for the most
       persistent. This group may total 10, 000 at present.</p>
      <p>The <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director and I have been considering this serious
       problem and on September 1, 1959, we discussed it with His Majesty the King and the Minister
       of Economy. I told the King that we faced precisely the same problem during the depths of the
       depression; our Government realized we simply could not let young men from the cities rot
       morally and physically; so the American Government created the Civilian Conservation Corps
       and put young men to work, under the Army Engineers, doing useful tasks of conservation and
       improvement. The greatest result of the CCC, I told him, was saving human beings, and the
       skills they had acquired, which were of inestimable national benefit when the war came. I
       told the King that if he wished, some of the experts of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
       would try to come up with some ideas on this subject for his consideration. The King was
       enthusiastic and stated that the problem of the educated unemployed (mostly at the high
       school graduate level) worried him greatly both as a human and a political problem; and he
       had often thought of some kind of a labor <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0758"/>corps. We
       told him that he would have to give such an effort attractiveness by labeling it a “Build
       Jordan” or “Save Jordan” program or young intellectuals would rebel against doing manual
       labor. Also for the time being such a corps should be confined to the intellectual unemployed
       since to mix in illiterate or nearly illiterate peasants, no matter how deserving, would ruin
       the chances of getting the intellectuals to enroll. The advantage of such a corps in Jordan
       would lie not only in the useful work they would accomplish, and the saving of human assets,
       but also in imbuing these young men with a sense of discipline and civic pride. It could only
       work in my opinion if supervised by the Jordan Army. If such a corps existed, then the
       temptation of the Ministers to load projects, many of which are cooperative with <gloss
        target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, with unneeded functionaries could be resisted. Job seekers
       could be invited to enroll and if they refused the Government could wash its hands of them.
       Financing should, in our opinion, be separate from the Army budget, although administered by
       the Army officers because they are the only element with sufficient administrative ability.
       Probably the funds will have to be allotted from the proceeds of the sale of PL–480
       wheat.</p>
      <p>The Department and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> will be hearing more of this from
       Mr. <persName>Burns</persName> and myself as the idea takes shape. In our opinion it is
       essential that something be done for the unemployed intellectuals that will develop the
       country and save their skills, and their loyalties, for Jordan. If it is not done, as stated
       above, many will be recruited secretly into underground Communist ranks or by other political
       adventurers equally dangerous to Jordan and to the tranquility of the area. After an
       enlistment in the CCC of a year or two, during which such young men could be taught manual
       skills on the reclamation and construction jobs which engaged them, many could find
       employment, it is hoped, in fields less overcrowded than the clerical work which is about all
       the purely academically trained can now do. We have no idea at the present time whether
       assistance, other than the allocation of some of the proceeds of the sale of wheat, will be
       required from the US. If it is, we hope that Washington can be flexible enough to find a way
       to provide such limited additional assistance on fairly short notice. Very important
       political, as well as human, values will be at stake.</p>
      <p>In the past we have granted Jordan limited quantities of military assistance in the form of
       hardware, for example following the emergency of April 1957. We are now about to embark on a
       three-year program of military assistance, the details of which are still under negotiation
       with the Jordan Government. The only comment that needs to be made on this program is that it
       is designed to meet pressing requirements and it has the same aim as the budget support
       discussed above—that is, peace insurance. The sole problem of coordination between programs
       entailed in this program of military assistance <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0759"/>is
       that we must be careful that our military assistance does not increase the Jordan Army’s
       requirements for budget support. We have gained the assurance of the GOJ that an increase in
       the Armed Forces budget level will not result from our contributions of military hardware,
       and we shall exert overselves to see that it is held to this understanding.</p>
      <p>Last year the US furnished some unplanned assistance, specifically a $5 million fund for
       emergency procurement of petroleum products, and a Title II, PL 480 program of grains donated
       for drought relief. No such programs are now planned for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
       >FY</gloss>–1961 since such emergencies are not known in advance.</p>
      <p>Coordination of the US program on the operating level has been extremely good in Jordan,
       and a tradition exists of frequent consultation. I expect such coordination to become even
       better now that the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> soon will be adequately
       staffed. The Country Team has shared in the task of preparing the <gloss target="#t_MSP1"
        >MSP</gloss> program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–1961. I intend to exercise fully
       my responsibility for coordinating US programs in Jordan to assure that they are well
       conceived and are being carried out as effectively as possible.</p>
      <p>As for non-<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> and non-US aid programs in Jordan, they are
       of relatively small significance compared with the large <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>
       program. One important segment of non-<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> US assistance is
       our contribution to the budget of <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss>. Jordan’s share of
       our contribution to <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> is about $11 million. This is an
       absolutely necessary form of US assistance, for without it we could not attain any of the
       objectives we are aiming at with our <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> assistance; the
       refugees must be taken care of one way or another for Jordan could not survive if the
       Palestinian refugees became a sole responsibility of Jordan. There is no problem of
       coordination in this area, for <gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> activities are
       primarily of the direct-relief variety; in the fields of education, health and welfare the
       refugees are handled separately from other Jordanian citizens by the GOJ. In other words, the
       refugees are outside the realm of our activities and must remain so for the present.</p>
      <p>The Ford Foundation is planning to provide the Jordan Development Board with five
       economists. We have met several times with the Ford Foundation area representative and are
       thus coordinated with this effort.</p>
      <p>Other non-<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> US assistance encompasses activities by
       missionary and voluntary agency groups and by private enterprise such as the exploration for
       oil by the Phillips Petroleum Company, the backstopping of Air Jordan by Transocean Airlines,
       and royalty payments to the GOJ by TAPLINE. With none of these activities do problems of
       coordination arise.</p>
      <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0760"/>
      <p>Great Britain is the only other country that gives assistance of significant proportions to
       Jordan, and the level of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assistance has been greatly
       reduced since 1957 when we began to assume most of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>’s
       financial responsibilities in Jordan. This year the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>’s
       efforts are directly supplemental to ours, that is, a limited amount of budget support plus
       an interest-free loan for economic development (earmarked for the Desert Road and Aqaba Port
       projects). The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is also assisting Jordan with a small
       military training mission. Coordination with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the
       field has been good and whatever problems have arisen have been worked out with the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Embassy in Amman. We do not know what assistance the <gloss
        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is planning to give Jordan in the next fiscal year, but it is
       likely to be in the forms and at the level of the present year. The Aqaba Port project will
       be completed this year, but an additional loan for the Desert Road will probably be
       required.</p>
      <p>The Federal Republic of Germany is engaged in a small technical assistance program in
       Jordan, for the time being limited to equipping a vocational school in Irbid and supplying
       technical advisers to the school. No problems of coordination with the West Germans exist. It
       would be helpful if West Germany and others of our Western Allies could be induced to
       undertake assistance programs in Jordan, both governmental and private, to supplement our
       efforts in the field of economic development.</p>
      <p>West German technicians are assisting the Arab Potash Company in developing the extraction
       of potash from the Dead Sea. Two East German technicians are due to arrive in Jordan soon for
       the same purpose. Personnel from the Yugoslav trust YUGOMETAL are managing the Jordan
       Phosphate Mines Company on a contract basis.</p>
      <p>An Italian firm will construct Jordan’s petroleum refinery. These projects are business
       propositions and are therefore not foreign assistance under the usual definition.</p>
      <p>One possibility that has not yet been fully exploited is assistance from other Arab states
       which have a surplus of capital for investment. This idea has been talked of much in the
       past, but it is hedged in with so many political and economic complications (instability in
       Jordan in the recent past and greater returns from investments elsewhere) that about all we
       can do is hope something can be done. An example is the investments a number of Arab states
       made in the Arab Potash Company. It would be helpful if we could find a means to convince the
       richer Arab states to invest in Jordanian projects rather than building apartment houses or
       casinos in Beirut. If Jordan continues to enjoy a period of relative stability, this
       possibility has more chance of success.</p>
      <p>The United Nations Technical Assistance Board engages in technical assistance efforts in
       Jordan in a variety of fields, mostly concentrated on participant training, furnishing
       technical advisers, and making basic economic studies. Coordination with our own technical
        <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0761"/>assistance programs is good and is carried out on
       both the working and planning levels. I recently met with representatives of some of the
       governments and organizations engaged in assisting Jordan in its economic development for the
       purpose of informal coordination, and I intend to have more meetings in the future.</p>
      <p>The US program of $40.5 million for budget support is a conditional promise which, as I see
       it, cannot be reduced. We shall do our best to keep it from rising, as we have done up until
       now. Economic development aid, which has been around $10 million annually, should be
       maintained approximately at that level. To cut this element of aid would have a disastrous
       impact in Jordan. A drastic cut would to all intents and purposes put a stop to economic
       development in Jordan, and, by killing all hope, would contribute to political instability.
       In his joint television broadcast with the British Prime Minister in London on September 1,
       President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> stated that “one billion seven
       hundred million people today are living without sufficient food, shelter, clothing and health
       facilities. Now they are not going to remain quiescent.” A million and a half of this vast
       army of the have-nots live in Jordan. We cannot afford to deprive them of hope. A drastic cut
       in economic assistance would have precisely this effect.</p>
      <p>I do not share the pessimism about Jordan which, with reason, was fairly widespread in
       certain circles in Washington when I arrived there early in February of this year. In a sense
       the peace insurance, which our major expenditure on behalf of Jordan is in essence, must
       continue until peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors can be concluded, or war occurs
       between them which could well inflame a very wide area if not the whole world. A major
       portion of our military expenditures in our own country, as well as in some fifty allied
       countries, is, similarly, essentially peace insurance.</p>
      <p>Paying the peace insurance premium in Jordan, and elsewhere, does not absolutely guarantee
       peace any more than our colossal expenditures for our own defense structure guarantee that
       war will not occur. But certainly it makes the likelihood of war much less.</p>
      <p>In the current and the following fiscal years, I advise that we proceed with our program in
       Jordan much as we did in Fiscal Year 1959, doing our best to see that we have the wisest
       order of priorities, and being flexible enough to undertake new or phase out old projects as
       our best judgment directs. Our overall stance in Jordan is appropriate to the situation as it
       exists today. It will be kept under constant review by the Country Team, as it is by the
       Department, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and the Department of Defense.</p>

      <p>During a call on the Secretary the Jordanian Foreign Minister stated that he had been
       requested by King Hussein personally to convey the deep concern of His Majesty and the
       Government of Jordan over the current situation in Iraq. The Minister stressed the dangers to
       all the Arab countries, as well as the Free World, of a Communist takeover in Iraq. He made
       it plain, however, that Jordan was also extremely worried over the possibility of <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention and that the United States might favor a Nasserist
       solution to the Iraqi problem. The Minister acknowledged that there was very little Jordan
       itself could do about the current situation in Iraq and said the King desired a frank
       exchange of ideas on this subject with the United States. He urged the United States consider
       sending promptly to Jordan a high-level emissary who could discreetly discuss the problem and
       possible measures to deal with it. The Minister stressed the King’s complete willingness to
       take whatever measures might be mutually agreed to be desirable under the circumstances. In
       discussing the situation in Iraq, the Minister professed to draw a distinction between the
       personal position and role in the Arab World of Gamal Abd al-Nasser (whom he acknowledged to
       be a popular and important leader in the area) and the threat of Egyptian domination of the
       Arab World—a prospect which he suggested was as unpalatable to the Iraqis as to the
       Jordanians themselves.</p>
      <p>The Secretary said that the United States shared Jordan’s concern over the situation in
       Iraq. He pointed out, however, that if someone were sent to Jordan to discuss the Iraqi
       situation it would soon become widely known, no matter how discreetly the matter was handled,
       and <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0763"/>would be taken as clear evidence that we were
       plotting against the Government of Iraq.<note n="2" xml:id="d405fn2">According to telegram

          Act,<note n="3" xml:id="d406fn3"><gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 86-108, July 24,

         assistance whereby, wherever practicable, such grant assistance shall be progressively
         reduced and terminated.</p>
        <p>Political and economic situation in Jordan such that we can foresee no specific timetable
         either for reduction or termination of US grant program in Jordan within period 1960–1965.
         We can, however, see several means by which US grant aid could possibly be reduced to a
         presently unpredictable extent and at a time we cannot now specify. Before reviewing these
         possibilities, might be useful restate basic Mutual Security Plan Objectives in Jordan, as
         country team sees them: <list>
          <label>1.</label>
          <item>Encourage and assist Government of Jordan to increase its economic development
           activity so as (a) to reduce ultimately magnitude of its dependence on external aid, and
           (b) to bring about discernible rise in present low standard of living, a requisite to
           political stability.</item>
          <label>2.</label>
          <item>Encourage the maintenance of armed forces capable of maintaining internal security,
           aiding in continuance of governmental stability, and successfully resisting encroachments
           until United Nations or Free World countries can take effective action to protect
           Jordan.</item>
         </list></p></item>
       <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0764"/>
       <item>B. <p>Our grant assistance to Jordan is designed to meet the above-stated objectives.
         Jordan is not a viable country and depends for its very existence as well as political
         stability on external assistance. With a population growth estimated at 3 percent per
         annum; a large military establishment presently essential to internal stability; the
         unsettled conditions in the area, and particularly the lack of settlement of the Palestine
         question; it is impossible to foresee any possibility of terminating our program of grant
         assistance in the period 1960–1965. Furthermore, the people of Jordan share the aspirations
         for improving their standard of living common to all the peoples of the underdeveloped
         countries. The disparity between their own standard (per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
          >GNP</gloss> of $84) and that of Israel ($722) may be particularly painful to them.</p>
        <p>If there should be a relaxation of tension in the area and a solution of the Palestine
         refugee problem resulting in a reduction in military expenditures, releasing funds which
         could then be diverted to economic development, we should have a brighter picture indeed.
         However desirable that situation is, it is not one on which we can prudently predicate a
         reduction or termination of US grant assistance.</p></item>
       <item>C. We believe Jordan should be encouraged to increase its economic development
        expenditures and to restrict future military expenditures to the present level. While our
        major objective in Jordan has been the maintenance of political stability, and it must
        remain our major objective, an essential corollary here as in other less-developed countries
        is the realization of a perceptible rise in standards of living through economic
        development. However, within this policy, there are several possibilities for reducing US
        grant assistance: <list>
         <label>1.</label>
         <item>Induce Western European countries, e.g., Federal Republic of Germany and Italy, to
          extend capital assistance to Jordan, and induce the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to
          increase its assistance. To the extent that such assistance is increased, our present
          annual grant of $40.5 million for budgetary support could be reduced.</item>
         <label>2.</label>
         <item>If a multi-year program of sales of US agricultural surpluses to Jordan under Title I
          of Public Law 480 could be initiated, the maximum proportion of the dinar sales proceeds
          to be granted to the Jordan Government, we might be able to: a) increase the total
          expenditures for economic development in Jordan and b) simultaneously reduce the amount of
          our grant aid. Our intention would be to recommend reduction of US grant assistance, but
          only to the extent of part of the amount generated by the PL 480 program. The feasibility,
          extent, and timing of such a Program cannot be determined now.</item>
         <label>3.</label>
         <item>If Development Loan Fund should be willing to undertake to finance a substantial
          volume of economic development projects in Jordan, consistent with Assumption 1 as stated
          by Department and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/W, our grant aid could be reduced.
          Country Team would welcome <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0765"/>this development and
          appreciates activities already financed by <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. However,
          uncertain as to how extensive <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> activities here will

       <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0766"/>for assistance to Commonwealth countries,
       particularly nearly independent nations, considerable increase in British private overseas

       from Germany, and domestic <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> opposition to assisting
       country from which <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> “thrown out”. Chancellor agreed,
       however, that present distribution (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> 15 percent, US 85
       percent) “not fair”. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> adduced numerous reasons

       thought of possibility that Germany might be willing to assume share of support, but did not
       pursue subject in detail. He indicated that British are currently engaged in assessment of
       the need for existing military bases and stressed that any increase in commitment on one
       hand, i.e., Jordan, would only be possible through reduction in some other existing
       commitment.</p>
      <p>Chancellor concluded that they would look at question of increase in <gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss> contribution to budgetary support and would study it in the light of their
       “reappraisal of priorities” of their over-all commitments. He stated that while they are

       September at time of Bank and Fund meetings. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
       accepted this commitment, but re-emphasized importance of reaching definite decision before

       Ambassador and Counselor had also left Jordan several days previously, leaving a Third

         superiority assures that Jordan would reap disaster should hostilities occur.</item>

        <label>3.</label>
        <item>If any Jordanian forces, land or air, should cross Jordanian border, Jordan in US and
         world opinion would be guilty of aggression. It would immediately lose widespread sympathy
         which it now has, and would prejudice most adversely any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
         consideration.</item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item>US has proven its friendship for Jordan. If Jordan should undertake any aggressive
         action, US cannot be expected to be of any assistance.</item>
        <label>5.</label>
        <item>US has admired statemanship King has displayed until now. We believe King has shown

       Ambassador not sure what impression he had made at end of talk. Sir Charles told me that for
       first time since he has been in Jordan he is “shaken” by present course of events.</p>
      <p>I obtained appointment with King 1:00 p.m. on ninth directly before
        <persName>Spinelli</persName> also saw His Majesty. I told King I had come to see him on
       matter of considerable concern not only to myself personally but <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737"
        facs="0769"/>also to my Government. We had heard reports concerning extensive troop
       movements from Jordan along Syrian frontier that appeared particularly disturbing at this
       time. I had come to His Majesty personally without authorization from my Government because
       USG had not had sufficient time to react to news of border build-up, but I said we would
       appreciate any clarification he could give us concerning present situation.</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (15 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>] I said that
       in last 10 days I had had Jordan’s problem constantly in mind. I had tried to visualize all
       possible actions and solutions. Natural impulse was certainly to strike out in fury. No one
       could blame Jordan for anger after series of incidents of last ten days. At same time, if
       Jordan acted out of emotion in present affair and tried to use forces across border, I
       personally could see only blow-up of disastrous proportions ahead. [<hi rend="italic">51/2

      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (10 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>I continued that more I had thought about this problem the more it came back to solution
       through channels of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Speaking personally I saw no helpful
       role for any individual third country in this affair. Equitable solution required prestige of
       some supra-national body and only organization which fitted this description was <gloss

       precipitate action before informing his close friends US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
        >UK</gloss>. I said I very much appreciated this reassurance, especially at this time and
       could His Majesty assure me that Jordan would rely on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       action before taking matters into its own hands? He [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
        source text not declassified</hi>] assured me that Jordan was moving “step by step” in
       complete consultation with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and he was shortly going to see
       Ambassador <persName>Spinelli</persName> who, he supposed, would be talking to him about same
        problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d410fn2">Spinelli subsequently indicated that his conversation

         ><ref target="#d409">Document 409</ref>.</note> I met with King and
        <persName>Talhouni</persName> together afternoon of tenth. I opened by stating that
       yesterday I had come to see His Majesty to express deep personal concern of myself and my
       government at Jordanian build-up of troop strength along Syrian border. Today I had come
       under specific instructions which, I had explained to King yesterday, I expected to receive
       momentarily. I then expanded on points in reftel and ended up urging in strongest terms that
       GOJ weigh most carefully in terms of its own future and welfare as well as in terms of
       international relations consequences which might occur if it should embark on an adventure in
       Syria.</p>
      <p>King heard me out without interrupting and when I stopped he smiled and said he hoped I
       would forgive him if he went over some of same ground we had covered yesterday. [<hi
        rend="italic">101/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (8 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>I then asked if Jordan intended to allow sufficient time to have its grievance heard by
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, why at this particular time should troops and armored
       strength be built up along Syrian frontier. [<hi rend="italic">91/2 lines of source text not
        declassified</hi>]</p>
      <p>In considering these three reasons, I said I realized there must be elements in Jordan
       which were crying for vengeance and which perhaps could not be satisfied except through some
       form of action. At same time, it occurred to me that troop build-up was subject to
       considerable danger. Tempers could easily be inflamed and any small incident at frontier
       could develop into large scale conflagration. King replied he recognized dangers inherent in
       this but thought necessity of safety valve justified present risk.</p>
      <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (131/2 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>] I
       thanked King and said I knew my government would be pleased to have his assurances. USG
       recognized there might be pressures on him, but we were sure that as a leader of the Arab
       world with considerable international stature he would be able to control those elements in
       his country which might desire hasty or ill-considered action. My government had come to same
       conclusion as he, namely that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0771"/>offered most satisfactory and possibly only method
       of seeking redress in situation. King agreed, said he would keep in touch with me, and again
       gave his reassurances.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I was most encouraged by this talk. Some of evasiveness of
       yesterday’s conversation was missing and King’s reassurances were clearer and sharper. I came
       away with firm feeling King in control of extremist elements and at least for moment will not
       allow them gain satisfactions they desire immediately. Moreover, I believe as of now he fully
       intends give <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> adequate opportunity consider case.</p>
      <p>Considerable danger still exists, of course, small border incident could provoke full scale
       attack. Also King might lose control to extremists. Greater danger than either of those
       perhaps is possibility of provocative reply from <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> to GOJ
       note requesting extradition or another incident similar to PriMin bombing. Latter case, I am
       convinced, would lead to instant and violent retaliation by GOJ against <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d411fn3"><p>On September 10, President
          <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> approved a personal message from him to
         King Hussein praising Hussein’s restraint since the assassination of Prime Minister
          <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName>, and counseling against military
         retaliation to avenge the death of <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName>. The

         the King “extreme concern both US and <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> regarding present
         situation.” <persName corresp="#p_KE4">Kocher</persName> concluded that the President’s
         message would have little additional impact if delivered on the heels of those démarches.
         Later, however, he felt it could be of “incalculable help to us.” (<hi rend="italic"

        446 from Amman, September 17, <persName corresp="#p_KE4">Kocher</persName> reported that
        Hussein had decided to head the Jordanian Delegation to the United Nations. While in the
        United States, Hussein stated that he hoped to be able to “renew acquaintance with old
        friends.” <persName corresp="#p_KE4">Kocher</persName> commented, in passing this
        information to the Department, that while Hussein’s decision would obviously complicate an
        already crowded schedule at the United Nations, he felt it was a positive development to be
        encouraged in that it meant that Hussein had decided to move away from a possible military
        confrontation with Syria and work through the United Nations toward a solution to the
        problem. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 320/9–1760; included in the microfiche
        supplement)</note> Immediately after telling me he intended go to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
        >UNGA</gloss> in October, King Hussein summoned in British Ambassador <persName
        corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Ambassador
        <persName>Spinelli</persName> and gave him same information. Later in evening three of us
       got together to compare notes. Both <persName corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName> and
        <persName>Spinelli</persName> believe King’s visit to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> a
       healthy development. <persName>Spinelli</persName> states that King said he intended visit
       New York to confer with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> re redress <persName
        corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> assassination plot but Hussein likewise stressed he
       also has “right to take problem to <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>” which obviously
       reflects pressure on <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to produce some results for Jordan
       in current problem with Syria. As for <persName>Spinelli</persName>, he will probably also
       appear in New York “since everyone else going to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>”.</p>
      <p>Question remains concerning future of troop concentrations near border. During my interview
       with King I asked him whether he intended keep troops near border during time he was at
        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and suggested advisability of removing at least some units
       back to previous positions. King said this was most difficult. One of his reasons for build
       up had been to offer safety valve to his people and if troops now ordered away from border
       without apparent redress for assassination plot it would weaken him in eyes of army.
       Therefore, he believed it preferable to leave troops in present positions and let them
       undergo extended maneuvers and training “for some time” and then gradually return them to
       previous positions, assuming of course that his trip to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
       produced some positive results. <persName corresp="#p_JSC1">Johnston</persName> had brought
       up related question with King concerning possible impulsive decision on part of CINC during
       Hussein absence in New York, but King had given reassurances this point.</p>

      <p>The President opened by expressing his pleasure at seeing His Majesty again and voiced
       particular appreciation for the support given to the Free World principles by His Majesty in
       the latter’s address before the General Assembly. King Hussein replied that this was “from
       the heart” and “how we really feel.” The President referred to the maneuverings of <persName
        corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in the General Assembly and his impression that the
       Soviet leader had succeeded in antagonizing a large part of the African representation, in
       addition to much of the rest of the Assembly. Now that the Five-Power Resolution gambit was
       over the Assembly still had all of its work ahead of it—nothing had really been done. The
       King concurred. The President asked whether <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0775"/>the King
       had been ill recently as he had heard. The King replied in the negative (subsequently the
       President again averted to this matter and the King said that perhaps the President was
       referring to a brief illness which he had suffered following his return to Jordan after
       visiting the United States in 1959).</p>
      <p>The President expressed his satisfaction that the King had escaped the incident which
       caused the death of the Prime Minister of Jordan. The King responded that this incident had
       greatly shocked the people of Jordan at a time when they were united behind the government,
       were making progress and were willing and able to defend the country’s independence. He had
       discussed the question with Secretary General Hammarskjold in New York and entertained some
       hope that the Secretary General might be able to take measures which would enhance the
       prospect of peace in “our part of the world.” He was not sure how much Hammarskjold could do,
       but perhaps something could be accomplished in the direction of handling political refugees
       who conspired to promote disorder.</p>
      <p>The President remarked that the problem of refugees (referring to the Arab refugees from
       Israel) was giving the American Congress a good deal of trouble. Some $23 or $24 million a
       year was being spent by the United States to help support them and while this yearly sum was
       not great in itself, it had been accumulating now for so many years that the taxpayers were
       restive over a situation which seemed to have no end.</p>
      <p>The President wished King Hussein to know about his conversation with President <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. He had taken up with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> the matter of Jordan and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> of
       course had flatly denied that he had anything to do with the assassination of Jordan’s Prime
       Minister. The King smiled faintly. The President went on to state that he and <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had had a very pleasant meeting; that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was very personable, but that he had noted that
       subsequently when <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> spoke before the General
       Assembly, he had to some extent taken the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
       line. During the course of their conversation they had discussed the question of free passage
       through the Suez Canal, particularly the Israeli cargoes. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
        >Nasser</persName> had said that this depended on the refugee question and had insisted that
       all the refugees wanted was to return to what is now Israel. This, of course, presented a
       rather impossible requirement and was not, according to our information, really demanded by
       all refugees. The King did not comment. The President continued that <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had stated emphatically that he was not one of those who
       insisted that Israel be eliminated and the Israelis pushed into the sea. At this point, the
       King’s face brightened into a broad grin and he, his Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and
       Ambassador, all exchanged amused smiles for some moments. The President continued that
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had indicated that if the refugee problem
       could be taken care of this would make a <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0776"
       />considerable difference in the atmosphere of the Near East and promote the possibilities of
       stability and peace. The President had mentioned the <persName corresp="#p_JSC1"
        >Johnston</persName> Plan<note n="2" xml:id="d414fn2">Reference is to a plan developed by
        Ambassador Eric Johnston in 1955, as President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
         >Eisenhower</persName>’s Special Representative, for an equitable regional division of the
        waters of the Jordan River. Extensive documentation concerning the plan and negotiations
        among the several concerned states is printed in <ref target="frus1955-57v14"><hi
          rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, volume XIV</ref>.</note> but <persName
        corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> showed no interest in it. The President remarked that
       technicians of countries involved had all agreed to the Plan. The King confirmed this and
       commented it was a “good Plan”.</p>
      <p>The President indicated that he had had a talk with only one other Middle East leader, the
       Prime Minister of Lebanon, but this had been a courtesy call without special substantive
       content.</p>
      <p>The President expressed his appreciation of this opportunity to see the King again. He had
       decided that he could not make a third trip to New York as this was very fatiguing,
       particularly in view of the crowds that delayed his journeys from Idlewild into the city. He
       had, therefore, indicated his desire to see leaders in Washington in order to have an
       exchange of views with them, and he was particularly happy that the King was free to come
       down. He again expressed his appreciation for the King’s General Assembly remarks and
       commented further that while countries had a right to be neutral if they wished, it was a
       satisfaction to see small countries speak up for principle. He was irritated at times with
       the manner in which some leaders of small countries (he referred to Nkrumah as illustrative)
       professed neutralism without stating what they were neutral about. Were they really neutral
       between freedom at home and Communist slavery? Or did they just want to fish into the pockets
       of one side or the other of the two main power blocs. The King felt the issue was between
       slavery and freedom regardless of the size of states.</p>
      <p>The President asked how long the King would remain in this country. The King replied that
       he planned to leave tomorrow evening (Saturday, October 8). The President expressed his
       satisfaction over the report he had received that the relations between Jordan and Iraq were
       improved. The King confirmed that conversations had led to the re-establishment of relations.
       He had taken the view that the Hashemites were a people ready to die for Arab causes and
       demanded nothing for themselves, no expansion or control over others. This opened the way to
       talks which would be resumed in New York the morning of October 8, covering details of the
       re-establishment of relations.</p>
      <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0777"/>
      <p>At this point, General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> indicated to the
       President that photographers were waiting whenever he wished and the President asked whether
       the King had objections to the taking of a group picture. The King assented, and the
       photographers entered, closing the meeting at approximately 11:00 a.m.</p>
      <p>The King received the press in the White House lobby and outside the northwest
       entrance.</p>

      <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Armin</hi>: On November 30, 1960, last Wednesday, I saw Prime
       Minister <persName>Talhouni</persName> primarily to push along the proposal to use refugees
       on afforestation or reforestation projects, a subject about which I have written separately
       to Lewis.</p>
      <p>I took this occasion, however, to bring up what I thought our attitude would be if the
       Government of Jordan decided to try to play the East against the West. The Chief of Staff,
       General Izzat Hassan Gandour, gave our Army Attaché, Col. <persName>Thomas</persName>, a
       working over on this subject (“Why should Jordan not do as other countries, namely <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Iraq, and accept military assistance from both sides?”) in
       late August after the General had returned from the United States; at that time I gave
       Colonel <persName>Thomas</persName> the line I had taken with the late Prime Minister
        <persName corresp="#p_Majali1">Majali</persName> a year ago at the time of visit to Jordan
       of the Soviet Ambassador to Lebanon. I find that by reference to <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
        >Embtel</gloss> 733 of October 24, 1959,<note n="2" xml:id="d415fn2">Not printed. (<hi
         rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 033.6185/10–2459)</note> that in a conversation with the late
        <persName corresp="#p_alMHP1">Hazza Al-Majali</persName> on that date: <quote
        rend="blockquote">
        <p>“I then said there was an expression in English that you cannot hunt with the hounds and
         run with the hares. I think if Jordan accepted assistance from <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
          >USSR</gloss>, US would continue help on East Ghor and with roads and perhaps agriculture,
         health and education. On the other hand I thought it was certain we would not continue
         budgetary support. I repeated I did not doubt he and the King fully realized dangers from
         relationship with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But perhaps there are, frankly
         speaking, opportunists among other politicians, or even among some <pb n="746"
          xml:id="pg_746" facs="0778"/>Army officers, who would urge Jordan take assistance from
         both East and West pointing to <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. If he wished he could
         point out that US did not provide <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> with budget
         support.”</p>
       </quote></p>
      <p>Without doubt Moulay Hassan’s acceptance of jets for Morocco from the <gloss
        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is stirring up this whole question again, and the way we
       react to this is being watched closely by both civilian and military leaders of Jordan. Our
       telegram 707 of November 21, 1960, stated that this Moroccan development had been mentioned
       to the British Ambassador by Prime Minister <persName>Talhouni</persName>.</p>
      <p>Since the late <persName corresp="#p_alMHP1">Hazza Al-Majali</persName> undoubtedly did not
       tell <persName>Talhouni</persName> about his October 1959 conversation with me on this
       subject, since he and <persName>Talhouni</persName> (then Rais ad-Diwan) were very much
       competitors and political rivals at that time, I considered it wise to tell Prime Minister
        <persName>Talhouni</persName> of what I had told <persName corresp="#p_Majali1"
        >Majali</persName> just about a year earlier. I did so on November 30, 1960.</p>
      <p>This touched off a long speech on the part of <persName>Talhouni</persName> in which he
       made, as reported in item “2” of our Weeka 168 of December 1, 1960, a statement which, if
       true, is to me at least a new revelation about an important historical incident. He stated
       that the offers of Egypt and Syria, in 1957, to make up (with Saudi Arabia) the subsidy which
       the British had withdrawn following the dismissal of Glubb Pasha and the denunciation of the
       treaty of alliance with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> by Jordan, had been made with
       Egypt and Syria merely acting as agents for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which
       had promised to make up the part of the withdrawn British subsidy not provided by Saudi
       Arabia for a period of 10 years. As reported in our last Weeka, <persName>Talhouni</persName>
       stated that the refusal of Jordan, although in dire straits, to accept Russian budgetary
       support, with Egypt and Syria acting as a cover, marked the beginning of the deterioration in
       the relations between <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and King Hussein.
        <persName>Talhouni</persName> said that for propaganda purposes Jordan for some time
       continued to ask, publicly, for Egypt and Syria to live up to their promises, but this was
       merely to embarrass them for they secretly repeatedly offered such aid to Jordan if it was
       supplied by the Soviets. Obviously, according to <persName>Talhouni</persName>, neither
        <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nor the Syrians could publicly reveal
       this.</p>
      <p><persName>Talhouni</persName> then went into a long discourse on the importance of the
       Jordan Arab Army to stability in the Middle East in which he made the statement that our
       budgetary aid went to the Army. I thought this was an appropriate time once again to make it
       plain that we did not provide budgetary aid for the Jordan Arab Army but for the Government
       of Jordan. I said I understood how the idea persisted that it was otherwise, because it was
       my understanding that the British used to pay all the costs of the old Arab Legion and the
       Government of Jordan was run on whatever it was possible to collect in taxes within the
       country. Some Jordanians, and Army officers in particular, might assume <pb n="747"
        xml:id="pg_747" facs="0779"/>that the United States had largely taken over the British
       relationship, but we did not see it that way at all. For one thing the Arab Legion was
       officered by the British, at least in the senior levels, and was for a considerable period
       considered by the British much as they considered the Indian Army, that is an army they could
       direct in time of crisis.</p>
      <p>I then said to the Prime Minister that the United States did not consider the Jordan Arab
       Army as in any sense a satellite army of the United States and as far as I knew it did not
       figure in any of our strategic planning. In other words, as I saw it, the Jordan Arab Army
       had two essential roles, one maintaining order in Jordan and the other protecting the
       frontiers of the country.</p>
      <p>I continued by saying I fully understood the distress of the Generals in the Jordan Arab
       Army at their inability to expand it since they saw an exceedingly strong Army across their
       border in Israel, and an increasingly effective Army being built up in the <gloss
        target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. As I saw the situation, the financial resources simply did not
       exist in Jordan, and there was no possibility of their coming from the United States, to
       permit the Jordan Arab Army to expand, and in fact I thought it would have to contract since
       there is no possibility, as I see it, of its being able to have a budget of more than the
       current <gloss target="#t_JD1">JD</gloss> 16 million.</p>
      <p><persName>Talhouni</persName> then made a long statement about the importance of the Jordan
       Arab Army to the stability of the Middle East as a whole. I replied I had the highest regard
       for the Jordanian soldier; he made a fine appearance and I had no doubt that man for man,
       properly equipped, he would be the equal of any soldier in the world. I also realized that
       with the development of highways the occupation of Bedouins in the carrying trade was being
       rapidly undermined, and, since inter-tribal raiding, and raiding villagers, had been stopped
       by the Arab Legion itself in 1925, there was very little remaining open to the Bedouins in
       the way of occupation except military service. But financial resources simply ruled out any
       expansion of the Jordan Arab Army, as I see the situation, and in fact to live within a
        <gloss target="#t_JD1">JD</gloss> 16 million budget I thought, although I am not an expert
       on military finance, that the numbers in the Army simply will have to be reduced. I said it
       had occurred to me that the Army itself might help those who may have to be released before
       they are ready for it by, for example, training some of them for employment in the hotel
       business, which over the coming years surely will expand. Also if the Corps of Engineers of
       the Army undertook to perform public works on a larger scale, it might be possible for the
       Ministry of Public Works to use some of the soldiers and officers who are surplus for
       military needs but whose dismissal would cause great difficulty. I said I fully realized the
       problem responsible political leaders face in telling the Army what it can or cannot do, <pb
        n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"/>since the Army is so important to the maintenance of
       order and security in Jordan. I also referred to the difficulty for His Majesty the King to
       see the Army curtailed, since he loves his Army as it loves him.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister then spoke with considerable feeling about the great importance of the
       Army in keeping the lid on in Jordan because of the third of the population who are refugees
       and another third who are Palestinians in full sympathy with the refugees. I replied I fully
       appreciated this factor, but I could not believe that the maintenance of order, even in these
       most unusual circumstances, required anything like 38, 000 which I understood was the current
       strength of the Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>As you know from other reports, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Military Advisor,
       Brigadier Street, has told the King that to live within a <gloss target="#t_JD1">JD</gloss>
       16 million budget the Jordan Armed Forces must be reduced, and we learn from Street that the
       King for the first time has accepted this as inevitable and plans to take steps to carry out
       this recommendation. There will be strong opposition, naturally, by the senior JAA
       officers.</p>
      <p>I fully expected that this conversation would be reported to the King and that it would
       depress him. This apparently occurred. When I took Jack Bennett and Norman Burns to meet the
       King the afternoon of December 3, after Jack had made his balance of payments spiel, the
       King, looking very grave, said that he realized the United States had problems. Jordan has
       extremely complicated problems, he continued, and he often wondered whether it was all
       worthwhile. He turned to <persName>Talhouni</persName>, who also was present, and said he had
       never talked in this manner before in front of his Prime Minister, who was also his friend of
       many years. Although the King had his usual charm, he apparently was in a mood of depression.
       Our Army Attaché, Colonel <persName>Thomas</persName>, took Colonel
        <persName>Snoddy</persName> and Lt. Colonel Hunnicutt, visitors from the American Army in
       Europe, to see the King the next day, and apparently he had bounced back. The British
       Ambassador told me on December 3 that while he was ill a British visitor had been received by
       the King and found him very depressed. For this reason John Henniker-Major had called on the
       King the day after he was able to leave his bed, but found His Majesty “full of beans”.</p>
