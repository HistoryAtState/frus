                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                        <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>
                        <item>To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current
                            diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
                        <label>b.</label>
                        <item>To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless
                            details.</item>
                        <label>c.</label>
                        <item>To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals

                            qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable, where
                            possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before the
                            decision was made.</item>

                <p>Documents selected for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                    Classification/Declassification Center for declassification clearance. The
                    Center reviews the documents, makes declassification decisions, and obtains the
                    clearance of geographic and functional bureaus of the Department of State, as

                                <p>The Act incorporates two other recommendations embodied in the
                                    President’s message of March 30, 1954. It amended the
                                    anti-dumping laws to transfer the injury determinations from the
                                    Treasury Department to the Tariff Commission and to provide that
                                    dumping duties would not be levied against importations made
                                    more than 120 days before the question of dumping was raised.
                                    The latter amendment will help to reduce interference with trade
                                    during the investigation of suspected dumping. The Act also
                                    amended the procedures for the classification of articles not
                                    enumerated in the Tariff Act by providing that, to the extent
                                    possible, such articles should be classified at the rate
                                    applicable to the enumerated article which they most resemble in
                                    use.</p>
                                <p>The Act also contains a number of minor provisions to facilitate
                                    trade. For example, certain metal products sent abroad for
                                    repairs or alterations may now be returned to the United States
                                    with payment of duty only on the value of such repairs or
                                    alterations. Uniform tariff status is established for
                                    importations from insular possessions.</p>

                                for exporters who can qualify. Under this new arrangement the
                                exporter himself is expected to carry not less than 20 percent of
                                the invoice value of the exported goods. Another 20 percent must be
                                received in cash by the exporter from the buyer by the time the
                                goods are shipped. The Bank thus participates with private capital

                                    agreements program for three years and provides new authority to
                                    the President to reduce tariffs through trade agreement
                                    negotiations. In return for tariff concessions granted to the
                                    United States, the President is authorized to reduce tariff
                                    rates over the three-year period by 5 percent per year. Likewise
                                    he is authorized to reduce tariffs in excess of 50 percent to
                                    that level. No more than one-third of such reduction, however,
                                    may be made in any one-year period.</p>
                                <p>This extension of the trade agreements program represents a most
                                    important step forward in the achievement of the President’s
                                    foreign economic program. The enactment of this legislation by
                                    an overwhelming vote in both Houses of the Congress reflects the
                                        <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0036"/>strength of the support

                                    time since 1948) will give the stability and assurance as to

                                for a substantially larger technical cooperation program for 1956.
                                Participation has been concentrated on providing experts and
                                know-how rather than large funds or shipments of goods except for
                                necessary demonstration equipment, and has been related to

                            <item><p>The Executive Branch has been striving vigorously to stimulate
                                    international travel in various ways, especially through
                                    simplifying governmental procedures relating to customs, visas,
                                    passports, exchange or monetary restrictions and other
                                    regulations that may harass the traveler. An International
                                    Travel Staff was established in the Department of Commerce in
                                    the latter part of 1954 to work with other agencies of this
                                    government, with national and international travel
                                    organizations, and with agencies of other governments. Its
                                    activities are designed to encourage foreign countries to
                                    improve their facilities for accommodating tourists, to urge
                                    them to eliminate unnecessary restrictions applying to tourists
                                    and to encourage an increase in their sales and promotional
                                    efforts within the United States. Other activities include the
                                    encouragement of increased travel to the United States through
                                    reduction of U.S. Government restrictions and through provision
                                    of international marketing data and other information required
                                    by private firms and companies in this field. This program has
                                    achieved a number of beneficial results.</p>
                                <p>The Bureau of Customs, as mentioned above, has adopted procedures
                                    for clearing travelers much more rapidly through customs at
                                    ports of entry. Studies are under way to improve further the
                                    handling of passengers and baggage. To correct a general
                                    impression that retail value is used in determining the value of
                                    tourists’ purchases for customs declarations, instead of
                                    wholesale value as permitted by law, the Bureau’s pamphlet
                                    “Customs Hints” is being revised, and customs inspectors have
                                    been instructed to use the reasonable equivalent of a wholesale
                                    value in making their determinations. Returning travelers may be
                                    expected to bring increased quantities of foreign purchases into
                                    this country for their personal use.</p>
                                <p>The Department of State has extended the period of validity of
                                    visas for foreign visitors from two to four years, with an
                                    unlimited <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0037"/>number of
                                    entries, and has taken steps to expedite issuance of visas and

                        successful conclusion such an important operation. There is an awful lot of
                        good stuff—important and concrete proposals—in those papers, and I hope that
                        you will be able to get this thinking into the official “think-stream” of
                        the Administration.</p>
                    <p>My second purpose is to take one of the items in these papers and put the
                        magnifying glass of urgency on it.</p>
                    <p>The item is the matter of our international economic plans and policies for
                        the immediate future.</p>
                    <p>Many of the events of the past few months, even the past few days, are such
                        as to give this matter top priority.</p>
                    <p>In bluntest terms, this seems to be what has happened:</p>
                    <p>Although occasional warning signals have gone up over the past two years on
                        the possibility of the Soviets shifting from the military to the economic
                        weapon, we never seemed to take this possibility very seriously, and as a
                        result we have been toying with the idea of a world economic policy, but not
                        doing much more than responding to economic fire alarms on an “ad emergency”
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>It will serve no useful purpose here to recite again the many attempts which
                        have been made to get out of an emergency frame of mind and into a “planned
                        growth” concept.</p>
                    <p>What is useful to say, is that none of them have really worked, and now all
                        of a sudden the Soviets have in the past few months executed a brilliant
                        series of economic forward passes, while we are still in our huddle trying
                        to work out some elementary signals.</p>
                    <p>As a result of these Soviet forward passes, a new and monumental threat today
                        exists in the Middle East, and the pistol is at our heads in India, Burma,
                        Japan, and portions of Southeast Asia.</p>

                    <p>Besides the spectacular arms sale to Egypt by Czechoslovakia, it is common
                        journalistic knowledge that Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Afghanistan
                        are considering similar offers. A Soviet treaty of friendship has just been
                        signed with Yemen, and Libya is being promised Soviet support for a seat in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Hungarians are shipping
                        locomotives and freight cars to Egypt. Some kind of hanky-panky is going on
                        between Poland and Ceylon. Spare parts for guns are going from
                        Czechoslovakia to Afghanistan, Czech trucks are getting into Jordan, and
                        Czech tractors into the Sudan. Soviet agents are working night and day to
                        get Nasser to give them the Aswan Dam contract, and stand a reasonable
                        chance because the Egyptians don’t seem to be able to get the money from the
                        World Bank with which to go ahead on the contract they have already signed
                        with a British engineering firm. Etc., etc.</p>

                        matter how he slices it, there is an economic gap of over a billion dollars
                        in his second five-year plan, a gap which he is going to close with help
                        from somewhere, because he is going to have his second five-year plan or
                        bust. Significantly, he has made overtures to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>
                        first.</p>
                    <p>Now the interesting, and in a sense terrifying thing, about every single one
                        of these cited situations, past, present, and future, is that all of them
                        are definitely within the economic orbit, and had we seized the initiative
                        with a world economic policy of imaginative proportions rather than
                        emergency rations, we might have been ahead of the situation in each one of
                        these cases. Some of them are by now clearly in the broken china class, and
                        we will just have to do the best we can. But some of them are not—notably
                        India.</p>
                    <p>The moment of decision is upon us in a great big way on world economic
                        policy. So long as the Soviets had a monopoly on covert subversion and
                        threats of military aggression, and we had a monopoly on Santa Claus, some
                        kind of seesaw game could be played. But now the Soviets are muscling in on
                        Santa Claus as well, which puts us in a terribly dangerous position.</p>
                    <p>I can see no effective course other than thinking this one through
                        immediately and coming up with a long-term world economic policy and plan
                        which can be dramatically stated in the State of the Union message, and
                        behind which every ounce of Administration pressure must be put.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0040"/>
                    <p>An essential element of such a plan is that it should not be niggardly. In
                        Max Millikan’s<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">Max F. Millikan, Professor of
                            Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</note> word,
                        there is a “threshold” short of which the money had better not be spent at
                        all, but at which or slightly beyond which the money achieves maximum
                        effective impact.</p>
                    <p>I have talked to quite a few economists to try to see what such a program
                        might cost, and almost all agree that an additional two billion dollars a
                        year for three to five years—mostly investment money—would be adequate; but
                        it is not worth acting on any scale much less than that.</p>
                    <p>This is big money, but it is time to think straight and hard. When we have
                        waited until crises were upon us, we have had to spend very large sums just
                        to avoid final debacle—as in South Korea and Indo-China. And these sums,
                        spent late in the game, have not guaranteed success. Vast areas not yet in
                        crisis still lie in the Free World, stretching around from the Middle East
                        to Japan. If we act before crisis is upon us it will not only cost us less,
                        but we have a better than even chance of moving these areas forward as
                        strong elements in the Free World alliance. This is a well-grounded hope;
                        but time is very very short to make good on it.<note n="6" xml:id="d2fn6"

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName></hi>:
                        Nothing has so engaged my attention for the past few weeks as the change in
                        the international situation. I am referring especially to the continuing
                        struggle between the Communistic and the free worlds.</p>
                    <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0041"/>
                    <p>I know that you have thought over these things as long and earnestly as I
                        have, and I am merely trying in this letter to put down a few obvious truths
                        that might serve as a basis for beginning our conversation the next time we
                        meet.</p>
                    <p>During the Stalin regime, the Soviets seemed to prefer the use of force—or
                        the threat of force—to gain their ends. They augmented this with a never
                        ending stream of propaganda.</p>
                    <p>So long as they used force and the threat of force, we had the world’s
                        natural reaction of fear to aid us in building consolidations of power and
                        strength in order to resist Soviet advances. In this way, we were able—at
                        the least—to convince the Soviets that there was for them little to gain
                        unless they were ready to resort to a major war. I believe they want none of
                        this.</p>
                    <p>More recently, they have seemed to have determined to challenge with economic
                        weapons. Now we have always boasted that the productivity of free men in a
                        free society would overwhelmingly excel the productivity of regimented
                        labor. So at first glance, it would appear that we are being challenged in
                        the area of our greatest strength.</p>
                    <p>However, there is one factor, always important in a military struggle, that
                        applies also, if with somewhat less force, to economic warfare. This is the
                        selectivity and flexibility that always belong to the offensive. The
                        defensive must normally try to secure an entire area, the offensive can
                        concentrate on any point of its own selection.</p>
                    <p>In a certain sense, democracy must always be on the defensive in anticipation
                        of any struggle, whether it be military or economic. This is because of the
                        necessity for debating every issue before our law-making bodies and thus
                        publishing to the world, in advance of any action, exactly what we intend to
                        do. Dictatorships can move secretly and selectively.</p>
                    <p>One of the problems we have is how to determine the relative value of this
                        advantage to the Soviets. I think that the promotion of economic
                        associations, somewhat as we have done in the military area, would be
                        helpful. What would be even more effective, however, would be the
                        opportunity to plan together <hi rend="italic">over the long term</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Long term planning would give every individual nation a <hi rend="italic"
                            >stake</hi> in <hi rend="italic">cooperation</hi> with the United
                        States. The power of the Soviets to move in with a startling type of
                        inducement would be far less effective.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of such long planned cooperation between the United States and
                        other countries (or associations of countries), the Soviets can move in with
                        a very tempting offer and on a basis that makes it exceedingly difficult for
                        us to counter the effect they create. In other words, they have the
                        advantage of the initiative. Thus, while we are busy rescuing Guatemala or
                        assisting Korea and <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0042"/>Indo-China, they
                        make great inroads in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>To be able to plan on a long term basis, and to do it both economically and
                        on a selective basis, it seems to me that we need some organization with
                        ample legal authorization that does not now exist.</p>
                    <p>As you know, I am by no means one of those people who believes that the
                        United States can continue to pile up bonded indebtedness and fail to suffer
                        dire consequences both economically and, eventually, in our basic
                        institutions. But we do have the picture today of America, with a constantly
                        expanding economy, with everything moving forward on a higher level of
                        prosperity than ever before, challenged by an economy which in its overall
                        productivity is not more than one-third as effective as ours. If we, at such
                        a time, cannot organize to protect and advance our own interests and those
                        of our friends in the world, then I must say it becomes time to begin
                        thinking of “despairing of the Republic.”</p>
                    <p>I believe if we plan and organize properly, we can do these things without
                        going broke, and that we can do them effectively and with the kind of
                        selectivity and smoothness that will largely rob the Soviets of the
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>I am hoping that you, <persName corresp="#p_HG2">George Humphrey</persName>
                        and I—possibly with the addition of <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herbert
                            Hoover</persName>, Randy Burgess and <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Sherman
                            Adams</persName>—can soon have a very informal meeting to chat over this
                        whole matter. Later, we will, of course, have to have larger meetings,
                        probably in front of the Security Council, but initially I should like to
                        have a kind of chat that would avoid all agenda, procedural customs, and an
                        audience. Possibly it would be better to have just you,
                            <persName>George</persName> and I at first.</p>
                    <p>Don’t bother answering this letter. I shall be seeing you or phoning to you
                        soon.</p>

                                this paper is that current Soviet economic policy is operative
                                within a larger political field and is most successful where the
                                broad political situation is favorable to it, as say, in Egypt and
                                Afghanistan. The Israel issue, the Egyptian-Iraqi rivalry, the
                                Pushtunistan problem, neutralism, resentment against the US or the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>—all of these existed before
                                the Soviet policy was undertaken. But it is in these contexts, and
                                in association with related Communist Bloc policies, that the
                                economic campaign has taken on substance.</p>
                            <p>For the longer run, the less developed countries almost inevitably
                                will be a continuing target of Soviet efforts to expand Communist
                                influence and power. It must be apparent to the USSR, as it is to
                                ourselves, that the process of social and economic change in these
                                countries will be a vastly unsettling affair. We do not have to
                                believe the present phase of Soviet policy is destined to be
                                permanent to recognize that the Communist effort to take advantage
                                of the situation in the underdeveloped world will be an insistent
                                and pervasive one. Indeed, it may well be that the Soviets consider
                                that the long run opportunities in this part of the world offer the
                                major hope for eventually overshadowing the US in the world
                                struggle.</p>
                            <p>Neither the shorter nor the longer view of the Soviet campaign offers
                                grounds for complacency. But they do suggest that US policy cannot
                                be directed narrowly at “economic penetration”. The more immediate
                                threats posed by Soviet actions involve the range of US military and
                                security policies in the Near East and South Asia. The more remote
                                issues relate to long run political trends in the less developed
                                countries and bring into the picture US stands on matters like
                                colonialism and racial discrimination, along with, for instance, US
                                economic development and commodity stabilization policies. The fact
                                that some of the issues are remote and that the Soviet appeal to the
                                less developed countries is not intended to win immediate satellites
                                only underscores the necessity for a broad look at US policy toward
                                the underdeveloped world. The danger is less of <pb n="14"

                                possible that a re-examination of the problem of the less developed
                                world will illuminate areas where US policy has needlessly provided
                                openings for the Soviets. But we should not make the error of
                                unreasoningly conforming our policies to those of the USSR, thereby
                                enhancing Soviet prestige.</p>
                            <p>For the most part, we cannot prevent other nations from trading with
                                the Bloc or from accepting Soviet aid, including Soviet technicians,
                                in their development programs. To seek to do so by coercion will
                                bring on us, for no return, the kind of obloquy that Stalin incurred
                                for his veto on the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Marshall</persName>
                                Plan in Finland and Czechoslovakia (and Stalin at least had his
                                way). And to try to match or exceed every Soviet offer will not
                                necessarily bankrupt the US, but it will help to fritter away US
                                prestige piecemeal.</p>
                            <p>Our economic assistance policies, similarly, ought to be our
                                creation, not the USSR’s. There is, first, the obvious truth that
                                the allegedly superior Soviet performance in this field is based on
                                a record so limited as to be of hardly any probative value. More
                                important, our assistance programs are intended to advance in the
                                most effective way possible the economic development of the
                                recipient nations. It is doubtful that this end would be more
                                closely approached if we were to offer assistance not only for
                                projects we considered wise but for any projects, unconditionally.
                                Or that the sum of economic progress in the less developed countries
                                would be greater if this government were to undercut the interests
                                rates of the International Bank.</p>
                            <p>In refusing to be drawn into a pattern of conformity to Soviet
                                initiatives, there need be no compulsion to hide our conviction that
                                Soviet motives are mischievous and worse. And where the Soviets are
                                meddling in local controversies we need to point up the dangers to
                                the peace that these actions raise. But public evidence of undue US
                                alarm at Soviet actions is likely to be counter-productive. As the
                                Secretary has said, we do not wish to have a monopoly on economic
                                aid and we have long stood for an expansion of peaceful trade in the
                                world.</p>

                                of course, for expecting that the change in Soviet foreign economic
                                policy will end by converting the USSR from habits of conspiracy and
                                militancy to what <persName>Harold Nicholson</persName><note n="2"

                                “commercial diplomacy”. But since the new policy does represent a
                                small step in the direction of living more normally with the rest of
                                the world, it may be worth considering <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15"
                                    facs="0045"/>whether the USSR can safely be enticed a bit
                                further that way. The most likely possibilities are in the field of
                                multilateral activities, where Soviet efforts at mischief-making can
                                be effectively exposed.</p>
                            <p>There may also be opportunities in Soviet Bloc economic policy for
                                our information programs. It will be desirable, of course, to point
                                out the extent to which Bloc purchases of surpluses have been
                                followed by re-exports of these commodities to free world markets.
                                Within the Bloc itself, neither Communist China nor the satellites
                                can be entirely happy over the allotment of some of the Bloc’s
                                resources to non-Communist nations. The Chinese Communists in
                                particular pretty surely were not satisfied with the amount of
                                Soviet aid they were given for the Five-Year Plan, and some of this
                                dissatisfaction must have cropped up again at the news of Soviet
                                loans to India and Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. And leaving aside the
                                Communist regimes in the Bloc countries, there is the question of
                                popular sentiment. It seems unlikely that Russian people, for
                                instance, can cheer the proposition that after their own bitter
                                sacrifices over four decades the Soviet regime is now intent on
                                raising living standards—in Afghanistan.</p>

                        recommendation that we should respond to Soviet economic policies by the
                        effective application and improvement of our own policies toward the less
                        developed areas rather than by efforts directly to counter Soviet actions.
                        It may be that a review of US policies in this field would have been
                        desirable anyway. The Soviet campaign, which, again, is not narrowly limited
                        to economic activities, lends urgency to the need for such a review.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>George</persName></hi>: I have just come
                        from presiding at my first meeting of the Council on Foreign Economic

                        I suspect they left knowing that they have a new chairman who intends to
                        kick the ball around quite vigorously.</p>
                    <p>I presented to them squarely the inquiry: What are the objectives and
                        purposes which we seek to accomplish in the world of today by our foreign
                        economic policy? And I shall keep pressing that question home in the weeks
                        and months that lie ahead.</p>
                    <p>It is my ultimate hope that I can come up with some new approach to this
                        subject suitable for a new Administration to offer to the public. To that
                        end, it is, first of all, important that I saturate myself with the thinking
                        of those who deal with this subject at first hand.</p>
                    <p>By this time, you will recognize a throwback to your luncheon.</p>
                    <p>I plan to fly to Paris some time late in August or early September and draw
                        in the key people from the various countries who could make a contribution
                        to my thinking out of their experience.</p>

                        twenty minutes, and then have give-and-take discussion for the balance of

                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had remarked that the
                        biggest problem of the immediate future is our trade policy. In this context
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> expressed horror at a
                        statement by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName> that “we
                        should deny our aid and economic assistance to those who do not accept our
                        political philosophy.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> discussed the “study group
                        concept” to examine our aid policy. The President had thought of a top-level
                        group to advise him on a continuing basis and had so recommended to the
                        Congress. The Senate had turned down the idea and set up its own group,<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">In <gloss target="#t_SRes1">S. Res.</gloss> 285,
                            adopted on July 11, 1956, the Senate established the Special Committee
                            to Study the Foreign Aid Program. The committee, first chaired by
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">Walter George</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_D1">D</gloss>–Ga.) and subsequently by <persName

                                >D</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_R1">R</gloss>.I.), contracted with 11
                            private U.S. groups to conduct studies of various aspects of U.S. aid.
                            The committee was instructed to transmit the results of these studies to
                            the Senate not later than January 31, 1957.</note> which would
                        undoubtedly devote itself to the investigation of past “give-away
                        programs.”</p>
                    <p>In view of the Senate action, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1"
                            >Brundage</persName> arranged a meeting of Messrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AS1">Adams</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                        to discuss the matter. This meeting considered a group, limited to five, to
                        study foreign aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said
                        he was very unhappy with the names suggested. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had expressed a desire for a
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> Commission<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d6fn4">The Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of
                            the Government, commonly called the <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> Commission after its chairman, former President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herbert Hoover</persName>, was
                            established on July 10, 1953, to study the workings of the various
                            departments and agencies of the executive branch and to make
                            recommendations which would improve efficiency and eliminate waste in
                            Government operations. The commission submitted 20 reports to Congress
                            in the 2 years of its existence. For a summary of the commission’s
                            findings, see its <hi rend="italic">Final Report to Congress</hi>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>, this raised the question
                        of conflict with Congressional activities and of possible conflict of
                        interest in the case of some proposed members.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> had also considered the
                        appointment of five consultants to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, but
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> was not happy with this
                        because it was too narrow and did not encompass the whole field of foreign
                        economic policy.</p>
                    <p>As for a committee composed of citizens not engaged in governmental work, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> took exception to that
                        too. He said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> had been
                        in favor of it. Mr <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> does not
                        want to place in power any public figure who might feel he could change
                        policy by his activity on a commission. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> has doubts about such a commission. Furthermore, the
                        time element is such that it would be impossible to get together the kind of
                        staff required.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> went on to say that he
                        conceived his responsibility to be to come up with a “bold new look.” He
                        recognized the necessity for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName>’ participation in this matter and has just prepared a
                        letter suggesting that no further activity be undertaken until Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> returns from Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>He plans to seek views from various sources for the next 60 days. He will go
                        to Paris and to the Pacific to talk with people on the firing line. At a
                        recent meeting in Paris, he stated, economic officers made it clear that
                        they did not know why they were in Europe; they did not know what our
                        foreign economic policy may be in the future. He wants to talk over foreign
                        economic policy matters with those “who bear the responsibility for them.”
                        He wants to do this in the same way that he had carried on his studies under
                        the old commission. His proposed method of procedure is to take each man
                        alone for one hour and make a record for the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss>. Each man presents a paper for 20 minutes and discusses it

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said it is necessary to
                        move pretty fast. He said the group did not know what the pressures were
                        from the “boss” and the Cabinet. He plans to go to Paris August 13, 14, 15,
                        16. He does not want any “blowing of trumpets.” It has been suggested that
                        he deal with the Far East as well as Europe at one time, but he had turned
                        that down. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName> raised the
                        question of going South as well as East and West.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then said “the
                        Administration expects me to present some of these questions to the American
                        people,” and “I plan to do some speaking and writing during the Fall.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> proposes to initiate the
                        program by sending a cable to selected individuals telling them that “you

                        make the arrangements himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1"
                            >Kalijarvi</persName> pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> had some doubts as to formalizing a meeting in any
                        one place with the officials proposed in the telegram, and said that he
                        would have to take the telegram back to the Department for clearance.</p>

                    <p rend="center">FOREWORD</p>
                    <p>Shortly after assuming my duties as Special Assistant to the President and
                        Chairman of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, I concluded that an
                        essential step for broadening and deepening my understanding of foreign
                        economic policy problems would be to discuss the subject with experienced
                        top level United States officials at their posts abroad. These officials
                        constitute a rich reservoir of knowledge and ideas drawn from field
                        experience, which can best be tapped through on-the-spot discussions. I
                        proposed at least two field trips, the first to selected European countries,
                        and a second to countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>This proposal was discussed with the Secretary and Under Secretary of State
                        and received their endorsement. They offered to provide the services of an
                        experienced foreign service officer to assist with arrangements.</p>
                    <p>I chose as my associates, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFD1">Forest D.
                            Siefkin</persName>, Vice-President and General Counsel, International
                        Harvester Company, who had been serving as my consultant; Lt. Colonel
                            <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Paul H. Cullen</persName>, Secretary of the
                        Council on Foreign Economic Policy; and Dr. <persName>C. Edward

                            Barnes</persName>, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State,
                        was selected by the Department <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>of
                        State to assist with arrangements and was asked to serve as a participating

                            the trip, September 9–17, a list of possible topics which they wished to

                        <p>The purpose of this section is to summarize the principal points made by
                            United States officials in Paris, Bonn, London, and Geneva in the papers
                            they submitted and in the discussions we had with them. No attempt will
                            be made here to draw conclusions about the merits of these ideas. The
                            papers which were submitted are embodied in the next section of the
                                report.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">Not printed. Papers submitted by

                        <p>The principal subjects to which officials addressed themselves are
                            summarized under the following broad headings: (1) Objectives of Foreign
                            Economic Policy; (2) Economic Integration of Europe; (3) Foreign
                            Economic Assistance; (4) The Organization for Trade Cooperation (<gloss

                        <p>Those who addressed themselves to this question generally emphasized that
                            foreign economic policy is a part of our overall foreign policy and,
                            therefore, must be consistent with, and contribute to the attainment of,
                            the objectives of the latter. All were in close agreement on the broad
                            objective of the foreign economic policy of the United States within the
                            overall foreign policy context. This may be stated as the creation and
                            maintenance of conditions in which the American economy can function at
                            a high and expanding level and thereby promote the prosperity and
                            well-being of the <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0054"/>American
                            people. In achieving this objective, it was pointed out that the United
                            States would contribute in an effective way to two other objectives,
                            namely the prosperity of the free world and the strengthening of ties
                            among the free world nations. It was further agreed that United States
                            policy should assist and encourage the orderly economic evolution of the
                            developing countries, not only as markets and sources of raw materials
                            but for the desired effect on their attitudes and orientation toward the
                            free world.</p>

                        <p>The subject uppermost in the minds of many United States officials in

                            countries closely together in an economic unit. Representatives of the

                            establishment of a customs union (or common market), and a committee is
                            now drawing up a treaty for the customs union. (The customs union would
                            have free trade among members and a common tariff against non-members.)
                            Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has proposed the formation of a wider
                            European free trade area which would include the proposed customs union
                            of the six countries of the <gloss target="#t_ECSC1">ECSC</gloss>. Under
                            this proposal, the participating countries would gradually remove all
                            tariffs on their mutual trade but each country which was not a member of
                            the customs union would maintain its own tariff against the outside
                            world. It is expected that a concrete program along this line will be
                            submitted to the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> about January
                            1957 for consideration and formal action.</p>
                        <p>Most United States officials with whom this subject was discussed believe
                            the advantages to the United States of European integration through a
                            customs union plus a free trade area (the United Kingdom proposal) far
                            outweigh any possible disadvantages both on economic and political
                            grounds. Only three officials expressed skepticism.</p>
                        <p>On the political side, it was the general view that ties among the
                            Western European countries would be greatly strengthened through close
                            integration of their economies. This could contribute significantly to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to other United States
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>On the economic side, it is their conclusion that economic integration
                            would lead to the development of strong, modern economies <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0055"/>with higher productivity and consumption
                            levels, and that this in turn would result in Europe’s becoming a better
                            market for United States exports.</p>
                        <p>It was recognized that economic integration would result in tariff
                            discrimination against United States exports, since reducing tariffs
                            among the countries comprising the integrated area would take place
                            without extending the same concessions to others. This discrimination,
                            it was generally thought, would not have net adverse effects upon United
                            States trade, especially since it would take place only gradually over a
                            period of at least ten years as internal trade barriers are removed. It
                            was argued that the United States would be far more likely to obtain a
                            liberal trade policy (including a dismantling of dollar restrictions)
                            from a strong, unified European economy than from the smaller, less
                            efficient economies as they now exist. It was believed that the
                            low-tariff countries—and these are the leading advocates of
                            integration—and the United Kingdom would participate in economic
                            integration only on condition that liberal trade policies toward
                            non-participants were adopted. Furthermore, it was generally agreed that
                            if the purpose of economic integration was achieved—higher productivity
                            and rising standards of living—Europe would become a better market for
                            United States products.</p>
                        <p>The consensus was that the United States should continue to support
                            European economic integration but use our influence to guide the
                            development along lines that seem desirable to us.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Economic Assistance</hi></p>
                        <p>There was considerable agreement that continuance of economic aid to the
                            developing countries would further the economic and political interests
                            of the United States. Of importance, it was believed, is the need to
                            raise the hopes of the peoples of the developing countries for a rising
                            standard of living. The achievement of this objective would promote
                            stable governments and check the trend to statism.</p>
                        <p>It was generally agreed that economic assistance should take the form of
                            technical aid plus financial assistance for the development of basic
                            facilities such as roads and transportation, ports, and possibly
                            power—facilities that are basic to the development of an economy but
                            which are not likely to be provided through private investment. While it
                            was agreed that efforts should be continued to develop climates
                            attractive to private investment, many were of the opinion that
                            government-to-government aid was also needed to meet immediately urgent
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Many United States officials interviewed now lean to the belief that the
                            United States should use to a greater extent multilateral <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0056"/>channels or mechanisms for the rendering
                            of economic assistance. Two reasons seem to lie behind this opinion:
                            first, the political reason that unilateral aid is often regarded as
                            “aid with strings attached,” and therefore is resented; and the second,
                            that the multilateral mechanism would facilitate contributions from
                            other industrialized countries and therefore reduce the requirements for
                            aid from the United States. There was no agreement on the extent to
                            which the multilateral mechanism should be used, but all believed that
                            unilateral assistance programs must be continued.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of loans versus grants, there was an expressed preference
                            for loans. It was pointed out, however, that the problem should be
                            examined on case-by-case basis as it would be undesirable to create
                            indebtedness beyond the capability of countries to repay. The conclusion
                            was that our foreign assistance policy should promote moral
                            responsibility for meeting international financial obligations.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Organization for Trade Cooperation
                                    (<gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>)</hi></p>
                        <p>Two principal questions on this subject were put to our officials: (1)
                            What has been the reaction in Europe to the failure of Congress to
                            approve membership in the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>? and (2)
                            Do you believe the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> should be
                            recommended by the President as “must legislation” to the next
                            Congress?</p>
                        <p>Most officials reported that they had heard little or nothing in Europe
                            about the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> during the last several
                            months. They were quick to say this does not necessarily mean that
                            European countries, except France, were any less interested in the
                                <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> than previously. Several
                            expressed the opinion that other problems for the time being were
                            overshadowing <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> in Europe particularly
                            the problem of economic integration. Furthermore, it was pointed out
                            that as yet the United States had not rejected the <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Opinion was generally in favor of continued efforts for United States
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. There were
                            differences, however, in the degree of importance which these officials
                            attach to the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Three arguments lay behind the opinions of those who feel that the <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is urgent. First, they say <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is needed to obtain for United States
                            trade the full benefit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
                                (<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>). Second, they believe that
                            the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> together are necessary to strengthen the position of
                            the International Monetary Fund, which is regarded generally by
                            Europeans as a “do nothing” institution. Third, they point out that the
                                <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>, an organization outside the
                            political arena, would offer an excellent opportunity to develop
                            cohesiveness among a large group <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0057"
                            />of free world countries, representing various cultures and all stages
                            of economic development.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the means by which multilateral
                            channels might usefully be employed. On the institutional side, it was
                            the consensus that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was not an
                            appropriate international mechanism because of the military character of
                            that organization, which would taint aid with military objectives. As to
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, it was pointed out that this
                            organization was generally regarded as the “white man’s club” and would
                            not be looked upon with enthusiasm by the developing countries. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mechanism was not generally
                            favored, although there was some support for a small <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> fund for economic development, provided
                            this could be used for the political objective of putting the Soviets on
                            the spot.</p>
                        <p>New regional groupings of countries, possibly along the lines of the
                            Colombo Plan,<note n="6" xml:id="d7fn6">The Colombo Plan for Cooperative
                                Economic Development in Southeast Asia, established by the United
                                Kingdom in 1950, included Ceylon, India, Pakistan, and the British
                                territories of Malaya and Borneo. The program envisaged an
                                investment of approximately $5.2 billion in the public sectors of
                                the participating nations and territories for the period from July
                                1, 1951 to June 30, 1957.</note> seemed to be the preferred method.
                            Such groupings would contain both aid-rendering and aid-recipient
                            countries. On the aid-rendering side, it was recommended that when the
                            issue of colonialism is important there be included countries which have
                            no history of colonialism.</p>
                        <p>There also was some leaning to a multilateral mechanism which would be
                            limited to a review of needs for economic assistance but would have no
                            aid funds or control over assistance allocations. It was generally
                            agreed that economic assistance programs ought to be based on a
                            long-range view. More stress would be placed on education and technical
                            training and the provision of basic economic facilities.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the extent to which Western Europe could contribute
                            economic assistance to the developing countries, the opinion was
                            generally expressed that a number of countries were in a position to
                            contribute significantly with both technical personnel and funds. It was
                            particularly emphasized that European countries had a reservoir of
                            highly trained technical personnel who could be recruited to go to the
                            developing countries, thereby relieving the United States of this
                            difficult recruitment problem at home. Western Germany is anxious to
                            assist with the economic development of the new and developing countries
                            and can supply both personnel and funds. France has been supporting a
                            significant development program in Northern Africa during recent years.
                            One reason given for support of multilateral aid programs was the belief
                            that use of such programs would maximize contributions of these and
                            other countries.</p>

                        <p>It was generally agreed that one of the most important foreign economic
                            policy problems facing the United States at this time concerns the
                            so-called “China differential.” This differential consists of some 450
                            items (or parts of items) which are subject to international embargo to
                            Communist China but are not embargoed to the European Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom and other members of the Paris Consultative Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>)<note n="7" xml:id="d7fn7">The
                                    <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> consists of 16 countries
                                participating in a multilateral agreement to control exports to the
                                Soviet Bloc and Communist China. The <gloss target="#t_CG1"
                                    >CG</gloss> has two committees known as the Coordinating

                                Committee (<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>). <gloss

                                controls against Communist China. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> have been pressing for over a year for a <gloss
                                target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting to consider reduction or
                            elimination of the China differential. They contend that the China
                            differential serves no significant strategic purpose because Communist
                            China can obtain all the differential list items through transshipment
                            by the USSR and satellites. The United States has forestalled
                            multilateral action on the China differential by not consenting to
                            calling a <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> meeting. In the meantime,
                            other member governments of the <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> have
                            been increasing their use of the exceptions procedures for licensing
                            exports.</p>
                        <p>The officials with whom this matter was discussed were unanimous in their
                            opinion that the United States should agree to a <gloss target="#t_CG1"
                                >CG</gloss> meeting by the end of the year to consider the China
                            differential. They believe that the U.S. will have to approve a sizable
                            reduction in the differential if multilateral controls are to be
                            preserved. They also believe that if the U.S. will go along with a
                            reduction of most of the differential, it will be possible to get a few
                            important strategic items, such as boron, added to the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> control list. They also think it is
                            unlikely that any member of the China Committee (<gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>) will agree to continuing any
                            item on the China differential on which exceptions have been made.</p>
                        <p>The greatest friction between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_CG1"
                                >CG</gloss> members concerns the strategic evaluation of the items
                            on the lists. A prime example is tractors which the United States claims
                            are strategic because they can be used to build airfields, while other
                                <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> members contend they are not
                            strategic because they are intended for agricultural use.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of the United States negotiators in Geneva that the
                            China differential could not be used to bargain with the Chinese
                            Communists to obtain our objectives in the current negotiations, because
                            the Chinese Communists must know that present controls are largely
                            ineffective.</p>

                    <p rend="center">FOREWORD</p>
                    <p>In December 1956, accompanied by three members of my staff, I visited the Far
                        East for the same objectives that I had in mind when I made a similar trip
                        to Paris, London, and Bonn in September. My purpose was to increase our
                        knowledge and understanding of foreign economic problems by drawing upon the
                        wide experience of United States officials serving in the area.</p>
                    <p>The discussions were unusually rewarding.</p>
                    <p>Once more, I followed the practice of inviting each participant in the
                        discussions to submit a paper dealing with whatever aspect of foreign
                        economic policy he found most challenging. These papers are included as a
                        supplement to this report,<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Not printed. The papers
                            submitted by individual respondents are <hi rend="italic"
                            >ibid</hi>.</note> and the highlights are summarized under the heading
                        “Observations and Proposals”.</p>
                    <p>In preparation for the Pacific trip, the Departments of State and Defense,
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, and the Bureau of the Budget
                        arranged briefings for us and provided us with briefing papers, all of which
                        we found to be extremely helpful when we entered upon the actual discussions
                        in the field.</p>
                    <p>My associates on the trip to the Far East were the same persons who went with
                        me to Europe in September, namely, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFD1">Forest D.
                            Siefkin</persName>, Vice President and General Counsel, International
                        Harvester Company, who had been serving as my consultant; Lt. Colonel
                            <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Paul H. Cullen</persName>, Secretary of the
                        Council on Foreign Economic Policy; and Dr. <persName>C. Edward
                            Galbreath</persName>, White House economist. Mr. <persName>Robert
                            Barnes</persName>, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State,
                        was again selected by the Department of State to assist with arrangements
                        and was asked by me to serve as a participating member of the team.</p>
                    <p>It is my hope that this report may serve somewhat to widen the understanding
                        of other Government officials with regard to the <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30"
                            facs="0060"/>economic problems of the Far East and Southeast Asia in the
                        same manner that I profited from the trip itself.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows a list of pre-trip briefings of <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                                >Randall</persName> and his associates by officials at the
                            Departments of State, Defense, Bureau of the Budget, and the
                            International Cooperation Administration. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> group explained that it
                            followed the same procedure as in the European trip (see <ref
                                target="#d7"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>) and met with
                            similar officials from the Embassies in Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam,
                            Laos, the Philippines, and the Republic of China. A list of suggested
                            topics for papers and discussion on foreign economic policy toward
                            Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia follows. Also included is a list of the
                            posts and officials visited from December 10 to 22.]</p>
                        <p rend="center">OBSERVATIONS AND PROPOSALS</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic and Political
                                Developments</hi></p>
                        <p>The economic situation in the Far East has improved markedly during the
                            past two to three years, although much remains yet to be done in every
                            country. The economic advances of Japan and Taiwan, particularly when
                            viewed against the background of war and economic dislocation, have been
                            spectacular. Viet-Nam has made remarkable progress on the road to
                            recovery. Less spectacular gains have been made elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>These gains, however, have not overcome all the shortcomings on the
                            economic side and in a number of cases are tempered by unfavorable
                            political developments. The situations in the Philippines and Burma
                            particularly are disturbing.</p>
                        <p>In Japan, industry is currently operating at its postwar peak. The steel
                            industry, for example, is producing at the annual rate of 11.5 million
                            tons of steel ingots as compared with about 7 million tons eighteen
                            months ago. Also, the shipbuilding industry is now producing at
                            capacity, whereas two years ago it was operating at 25 percent of
                            capacity. The high level of economic activity is reflected in the per
                            capita consumption of food and clothing, now about 10 percent above
                            prewar levels. Exports have increased 100 percent in three years. Japan
                            moved from a $313 million deficit in its balance of payments in 1953–54
                            to a $535 million surplus in 1955–56, or virtually to a balanced
                            position when special dollar receipts (expenditures by and for U.S.
                            armed forces) are excluded.</p>
                        <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0061"/>
                        <p>These remarkable economic advances by Japan may be attributed primarily
                            to three factors: (1) Japan’s own efforts, (2) a record rice crop in
                            1955 and a crop above average in 1956, and (3) the high degree of
                            industrial activity in Western nations which not only created an
                            enlarged demand for Japanese products but also drove buyers to Japan
                            from customary sources of supply because of delays there in delivery. A
                            high level of defense expenditures by the United States in Japan, which
                            provided about 20 percent of Japan’s foreign exchange in 1955, was also
                            an important factor. Certain of these factors do not provide a solid
                            basis for the future of Japan’s economy.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Japanese industry in many fields cannot, at least for the
                            present, compete price-wise with producers elsewhere. In 1956, for
                            example, Japanese steel bars were selling at 10 percent above world
                            prices, steel sheets at 18 percent, copper at 10 percent, ammonium
                            sulphate at 18 percent, caustic soda at 55 percent, and aluminum at 2 to
                            3 percent.</p>
                        <p>There are other weaknesses in the Japanese economy: shortage of capital,
                            a dearth of raw materials, and land shortage. The weak and uncertain
                            political situation, resulting from lack of strong leadership and
                            growing political opposition to the party in power, together with rising
                            nationalism, may well have adverse economic repercussions.</p>
                        <p>In Korea, the task of repairing or rebuilding most of the commercial,
                            transportation and communications facilities, destroyed during the war,
                            has been largely completed. Electric power facilities have been built to
                            supply electric power, formerly obtained primarily from the
                            hydroelectric facilities in the north. Agricultural production has been
                            increased, although Korea is still a food deficit country. Consumption,
                            except for housing, is estimated to be back to the level of 1949–50, and
                            in some instances even higher.</p>
                        <p>Despite these accomplishments in Korea, to which massive United States
                            economic aid has made a major contribution, return to viability does not
                            appear possible for a long time. There are now at least 5 million more
                            people in South Korea than in 1945. The country has been cut off from
                            the complementary northern half which contained most of the abundant
                            natural resources. And it will be necessary for an indefinite time to
                            maintain a large Korean military establishment. It is essential,
                            therefore, that economic development programs go forward as rapidly as
                            possible, so as to build up the economic capabilities of the country and
                            reduce the amount of assistance required in the future from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>On Taiwan, the remarkable economic achievement includes successful but
                            evolutionary land reform programs accompanied by a substantial increase
                            in agricultural production, a much larger rise <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32"
                                facs="0062"/>proportionately in industrial output, and a modest but
                            steady rise in living standards to levels rarely found in Asia. Notable
                            progress has also been achieved in public health, education and general
                            welfare. Despite these gains, the economy is not able to support the
                            huge military establishment maintained there with United States support
                            as defense against further aggression by Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties of Viet-Nam during the past two years have been
                            formidable. There was the problem of receiving and caring for some
                            three-quarters of a million refugees from the Communist North.
                            Government administration had to be established in areas formerly
                            controlled by the Vietminh. The most productive agricultural areas in
                            the Southwest were controlled by dissident sects. The railways and
                            canals were destroyed or in disrepair. Population had migrated from
                            troubled areas to urban communities, abandoning farms and overcrowding
                            the cities. Needless to say, production of the principal crops—rice and
                            rubber—had declined to very low levels. Few observers believed that
                            Viet-Nam had a chance of survival. The miraculous recovery over the past
                            two years is now a matter of history. That massive economic aid from the
                            United States was poured into Viet-Nam should not detract from the
                            achievements of this country through its own efforts.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Thailand appears stable but its economy is not making
                            substantial progress. As in other developing countries, there is a
                            dearth of capital and of technical and managerial personnel. An adequate
                            source of power is presently lacking, since there is virtually no coal,
                            and hydropower possibilities are limited. In the north, construction of
                            a dam appears feasible, and the Thais propose to undertake this project
                            with the view to producing about 500,000 kwh. of electric power or 5
                            times the present very limited capacity. Before economic development can
                            progress far, not only must more power be available but improved
                            transportation and communications must be provided. Deficiency in human
                            resources, which manifests itself at all levels of the economic and
                            social structure, is perhaps the most pervasive factor inhibiting
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>The economy of Thailand is based largely on rice and a few raw materials,
                            primarily crude rubber, tin ore and teakwood. Altogether these products
                            provide about five-sixths of Thailand’s foreign exchange earnings. Its
                            few industries are small in character and, except for rice milling,
                            produce only for local markets.</p>
                        <p>Thailand’s current level of exports do not provide enough earnings to
                            finance the foreign exchange cost of a sizeable economic development
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere in the Far East, the economic picture is not bright. The
                            situation in Burma is serious. While gross national product has risen
                            since 1950, it is still scarcely 90 percent of prewar. Per capita <pb
                                n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0063"/>consumption is only about 70
                            percent of the prewar level. Burma remains highly dependent on rice
                            exports, which represent approximately 80 percent of the value of its
                            export earnings. Popular discontent is growing, and if the present
                            government is to remain in power, it must lead the country to dramatic
                            economic progress within a relatively short period of time. The
                            seriousness of the situation is greatly intensified by the fact that the
                            only significant opposition groups are either Communist or Communist
                            infiltrated and manipulated.</p>
                        <p>In the Philippines, economic progress has been discouragingly slow.
                            Productivity in both agriculture and industry remains low, even by Asian
                            standards. Crop yields are among the lowest in Southeast Asia.
                            Local-consumption industries are inefficient and are highly protected
                            against foreign competition. Mineral resources, abundant as they are,
                            have been largely neglected: Nationalism and antipathy toward the
                            Chinese in the Islands plus the absence of a satisfactory foreign
                            investment law have discouraged private foreign investment. Unemployment
                            is estimated at 12 percent of the labor force, and underemployment is an
                            even greater problem. The unsatisfactory economic situation constitutes
                            a serious threat on the political front and stands in the way of
                            adequate support through the Philippine budget for essential military
                            support expenditures. The balance of payments is weak despite the
                            special benefits from United States Government sources, which total
                            about $190 million (including $65 million for veterans’ payments) or
                            nearly 40 percent of total foreign exchange earnings.</p>
                        <p>A number of features characterize several or nearly all of the free
                            countries of the Far East. Production increases are scarcely keeping
                            ahead of population growth in a number of countries. In most of the
                            countries, the governments are suffering from a lack of competent
                            officials. There is also a growing nationalism which militates against
                            the inflow of private investment and technical and managerial talent,
                            and a growing pacifism which limits support of the military forces.
                            Except for Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, food is produced abundantly, and
                            much arable land remains to be cultivated and is available pretty much
                            for the taking.</p>
                        <p>The control of malaria is far advanced in the area. This points to future
                            success in adoption of public health measures which can have only
                            beneficial results for all the nations concerned.</p>
                        <p>Burma is the only country in the area in which Soviet economic
                            penetration has made much headway. Dealings with the Soviets, however,
                            have not turned out well for the Burmese in important instances, and
                            recently the Burmese Government has turned to the United States for
                            assistance. Here is an opportunity for the United <pb n="34"
                                xml:id="pg_34" facs="0064"/>States to demonstrate goodwill and
                            desire to help that country overcome its distressing economic
                            situation.</p>

                                Forces</hi></p>
                        <p>The ability of friendly Far East countries to support armed forces is
                            extremely limited at the present time. Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and
                            possibly the Philippines are the only ones capable of supporting armed
                            forces adequate for internal security. Viet-Nam and Laos are unable to
                            support such forces. In Korea a state of suspended warfare exists.</p>
                        <p>From the economic standpoint, Japan can support a sizeable defense force
                            beyond that needed for internal security, but the political situation is
                            preventing the appropriation of adequate funds. The Japanese were
                            thoroughly disillusioned by their defeat in World War II and are fearful
                            of a resurgence of the military to power. The Socialist opposition,
                            holding 35 to 40 percent of the seats in the Diet, is solidly against
                            increased military expenditures. Improvement in the political situation
                            and a reduction in the strength and influence of the Socialists must be
                            accomplished before Japan can be expected to play an appropriate defense
                            role. The situation in Japan is complicated by the Constitutional
                            provision, included at the insistence of the United States, limiting the
                            size of the armed forces Japan may maintain.</p>
                        <p>In Korea, because a state of suspended warfare exists, the armed forces
                            required are large. Adequate manpower is available currently for the
                            military forces being maintained—and the Korean Government wants a large
                            military force—but the country is unable to provide much budgetary or
                            economic support. Along with other military and economic aid, the United
                            States is now financing out of counterpart funds a deficit of $120–130
                            million in the Korean military budget.</p>
                        <p>Lagging economic development in the Philippines and the unstable
                            political situation there stand in the way of an adequate defense
                            effort. The Philippine Government has taken a firm position that
                            economic development must come first, and that position is reflected in
                            the defense budget which provides little more than pay for military
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>Virtually the entire military program in Viet-Nam and Laos is
                            underwritten by the United States. The capability to maintain forces at
                            a level required even for internal security will not be reached for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Nationalist Government on Taiwan is now carrying a sizeable
                            portion of the local currency cost of its huge military establishment,
                            but the limited resources of the island cannot <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35"
                                facs="0065"/>in the foreseeable future earn the foreign exchange to
                            pay for the imports required by the military. At most, it is unlikely to
                            be able to bear more than the local currency cost of maintaining armed
                            forces of the present size—a large and vital part of the free world’s
                            military strength in East Asia and the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>One concern of United States officials responsible for military and
                            economic assistance to certain of these countries has been the problem
                            of inflation where supplies of goods have not been adequate for the
                            financial income generated. To absorb local currency and increase the
                            supply of goods, the aid programs have been utilized to bring in
                            consumables which are sold for local currency. In certain cases, it has
                            been pointed out, this anti-inflationary device may result in raising
                            the consumption level of the country to a point which cannot in the
                            future be sustained by the country’s own economy, particularly in the
                            absence of an adequate economic development program.</p>
                        <p>One conclusion stands out clearly. In those cases where United States aid
                            programs are large, it is vital that enough of the assistance effort be
                            devoted to economic development in order that the country itself may in
                            the future become less dependent on outside aid. Otherwise, the burden
                            on the United States taxpayer will continue and even increase. In the
                            absence of a substantial increase in private foreign investment, either
                            the military program will have to be reduced in order to make more aid
                            available for economic development, or additional funds will have to be
                            appropriated.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is highly desirable that the countries themselves provide
                            at least subsistence support for their military forces. It is essential
                            to morale in the developing countries that their military forces be
                            fully maintained by their own military budget and be at all times under
                            full control of their own people.</p>

                        <p>Trade among the free world countries of the Far East has not developed to
                            any considerable degree in the post World War II period. This is a
                            reflection of the slow rate of economic expansion in Southeast Asia
                            including the Philippines. In Southeast Asia, other than the
                            Philippines, rice continues to provide most of the foreign exchange
                            earnings.</p>
                        <p>Japanese foreign trade has increased rapidly, doubling in the last three
                            years, and in 1955–56 the country attained a balanced position in its
                            international payments without reliance on special dollar receipts from
                            the United States armed forces. This trade has been built up primarily
                            with the United States and the industrial countries of Western
                            Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>
                        <p>In trade with the United States, Japan in 1955 purchased goods valued at
                            $780 million and sold goods valued at $459 million. Japan is the largest
                            purchaser of United States agricultural products—raw cotton, wheat,
                            barley, soybeans and tallow. It is in this context that the problem of
                            Japanese exports to the United States should be appraised.</p>
                        <p>In Japan, trade with Communist China has become an important political
                            issue. Expansion of such trade is supported by the Socialist members of
                            the Diet and a number of the Conservatives, as well as by many business
                            leaders. The Japanese resent the way in which the controls on trade with
                            Communist China affect Japan. She is prevented from shipping directly to
                            Communist China many items which Western European countries may sell to
                            the European members of the Soviet Bloc. They in turn transship them to
                            Communist China. This resentment may however, be presently more of a
                            political irritant than it is an economic factor. The American Embassy
                            in Japan doubts whether Japan’s exports to Communist China would exceed
                            $125 million (or 5 percent of total exports), compared with 1956 exports
                            of $50 million, even if controls were reduced to the level of those
                            governing trade with the European Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, could provide many additional
                            raw materials which Japanese industries urgently require. The
                            development of these resources would, in turn, increase the ability of
                            the Southeast Asian countries to earn foreign exchange, and thus make
                            them better markets for Japanese exports.</p>
                        <p>Because rice is a major factor in every economy of Southeast Asia,
                            American officials in the area caution that this country should make
                            every effort in disposing of surplus rice and wheat not to disrupt
                            established rice trade and rice markets. They warn that there is no
                            surer way of driving these countries toward Communist markets than by
                            disturbing their established outlets for rice.</p>
                        <p>The Philippines and other countries in Southeast Asia, except for
                            Thailand, are suffering from chronic balance of payments deficits. This
                            situation must be corrected. Foreign private investment in the
                            undeveloped resources of these countries could provide much larger
                            exports of industrial raw materials and thus increase foreign exchange
                            earnings. Further proposals for improving this situation through trade
                            and economic development are discussed in the section on “Proposal for
                            Regional Economic Cooperation”.</p>

                        <p>An adequate supply of investment capital is a major need of all the free
                            countries of the Far East and Southeast Asia. Most of <pb n="37"
                                xml:id="pg_37" facs="0067"/>the countries have important untapped
                            mineral deposits which could be developed into major export
                            industries.</p>
                        <p>Capital in the amount needed for this economic development can presently
                            come only from the outside. Economic assistance from the United States
                            has played an important role in enabling these countries to survive in
                            the aftermath of World War II, but private foreign capital is needed for
                            the economic development job ahead.</p>
                        <p>The investment climate, however, is not attractive to private
                            enterprise.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of reasons for this adverse investment climate. Most
                            of these countries have only recently attained their political
                            independence and are fully imbued with nationalism. Private foreign
                            investment, to them, is a threat to their independence. They regard it
                            as a form of colonialism. They want to control the development of their
                            own resources. In Burma, the Government has committed itself to
                            socialization as the only acceptable road to economic development. Even
                            where socialism or extreme nationalism does not prevail, adequate
                            investment laws have not been enacted, and the equity concept is slow in
                            developing, even in Japan. There is also a lack of knowledge of how
                            private enterprise operates.</p>
                        <p>There is great need in that area of the world, therefore, for a change in
                            attitude toward foreign private capital investment. The United States,
                            perhaps, can do more to bring about this change. Investment laws, which
                            create a friendly attitude toward foreign private capital and enterprise
                            while at the same time protecting the essential interests of the
                            underdeveloped countries, might be worked out. Joint ventures, covered
                            by specific agreement on nationalization, might be used to make private
                            foreign investment attractive, as has been tried in Burma. A good deal
                            of education is also needed to develop the equity concept and to show
                            its great merits.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that some accommodation to socialism is worth
                            looking into provided that private enterprise is given an
                            opportunity—through an appropriate investment law and other measures to
                            provide a favorable climate—to demonstrate its superiority. The argument
                            is that when the two systems are permitted to work side-by-side, private
                            enterprise will do the job so much better than enthusiasm for socialism
                            will wane.</p>

                        <p>Following the close of the war in the Pacific, and likewise following the
                            armistice in Korea, the foreign economic policy of the United States in
                            the Far East developed step by step, and nation by nation, but
                            essentially always on a bilateral basis. Whether in the field of
                            economic assistance, or that of trade, or of private investment, <pb
                                n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0068"/>our policies and programs have
                            been designed in terms of the relationship between the United States and
                            the particular country in question, rather than in terms of the
                            relationship of the Asian countries with each other, or of Southeast
                            Asia as a whole. Much of our planning necessarily had to be done in the
                            face of emergency conditions, and had to be designed to meet short-term
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>That period is passing. This is the time for reappraisal, and for making
                            a determined effort to provide the leadership that may serve to draw the
                            nations of the area into closer economic relationships so that the
                            strength of one may serve to offset the weakness of another, and the
                            collective well-being be made to rest more upon mutual and complementary
                            effort, and less upon the resources of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The first step in this direction might well be the calling of an economic
                            conference in the Pacific in which the Asian nations would themselves
                            discuss their economic problems, and explore ways by which they might be
                            of mutual assistance in the development of the total resources of the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Consideration of the problem of steel production and consumption in the
                            area offers an example of what might be accomplished.</p>
                        <p>All the Asian nations have a rapidly increasing demand for steel. Japan
                            has great capacity for the production of steel and possesses both
                            management and technical skills, but her industry is operating under
                            severe handicap for lack of raw materials. Those supplies are available
                            elsewhere in the region.</p>
                        <p>As a substitute, Japan is making an embarrassingly heavy demand on the
                            export of steel scrap from the United States. War scrap is available in
                            the Philippines, but that country forbids its exportation, and makes no
                            effort to collect and sell its domestic scrap.</p>
                        <p>New blast furnaces, if built in Japan, would curtail the importation of
                            scrap from the United States, but the capital is not available. If
                            built, those blast furnaces would require coal and iron ore. Coking coal
                            is available on Taiwan, if plans for its exploitation could be worked
                            out, and iron ore is awaiting development in Burma, Thailand, the
                            Philippines and Korea.</p>
                        <p>If all of the nations involved in those transactions should jointly
                            consider the problem of steel production, and if the United States could
                            reorient its policies to a regional concept, spectacular progress might
                            be achieved.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the duplication of such basic facilities as textile mills,
                            sugar factories, and cement plants could be avoided if under our
                            friendly guidance the various countries considered ways of conserving
                            their limited capital potential, by dividing the effort.</p>
                        <p>The question of what Asian nations should be invited to such an economic
                            conference is one that would have to be approached <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0069"/>thoughtfully. Many different suggestions
                            were made in the course of our discussions with United States officials
                            in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>One obvious problem is that of whether Australia and New Zealand should
                            be included, but there seems to be consensus that they should not, for
                            fear that their presence might overawe the less advanced nations whose
                            capacity for self-development it is desired to stimulate.</p>
                        <p>The Colombo Plan group has been proposed, but this meets the objection
                            that it is a group which is socialist in influence, and British in
                            background. Furthermore, it does not include Taiwan and Korea, both of
                            whom need closer association with Asian neighbors.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> is a possibility, but it includes
                            Australia and New Zealand as well as the United Kingdom and France, and
                            only two of the underdeveloped countries of the area under
                            consideration, namely Thailand and the Philippines. Also <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> is linked, at least
                            psychologically, with a military-defense objective.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the basis, it is clear that Japan should be included, for Japan
                            is the key to the economic development of Asia.</p>
                        <p>Yet clearly Japan must not call the conference. The animosities arising
                            from conquest and occupation are still too fresh, and the fear of Japan
                            as a sharp trader is too real, to risk that leadership.</p>
                        <p>Probably the country best situated, both geographically and
                            psychologically, for being the host government is the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Before approaching either the host government or other nations on this
                            project, it would be prudent to bring together our own key economic
                            officials from all parts of the area in order that the purposes and
                            plans of the United States vis-à-vis such a regional grouping might be
                            clearly established.</p>
                        <p>One basic field of inquiry would be that of whether regional financial
                            support would be provided by our country, and if so from what sources.
                            Agencies such as the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the
                            Export-Import Bank might be helpful, but so far their emphasis has
                            perhaps been on the more mature economies, rather than on those of the
                            primitive nations found in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The President’s Fund for the Development of Asia might find such a
                            regional group to be the appropriate vehicle for its activity, and
                            conceivably Congress could be asked to make direct appropriations for
                            that purpose.</p>
                        <p>Our leadership might be more important than our money. Certainly every
                            precaution would have to be taken lest it be thought that a new
                            super-form of aid was being created.</p>
                        <p>Funds generated in the area itself might also be employed such as the
                                <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> payments, and Japanese
                            reparations.</p>

                        <p>It is mutual assistance among the various countries that is now urgently
                            needed, for the gap between the developed and the underdeveloped nations
                            is rapidly widening, and there is danger that with this may come a
                            widening of the gap in understanding. To promote joint activity in the
                            economic field where self-interest may be served would be the best
                            possible foundation for improved military security in the area, as well
                            as for political cooperation among the constituent nations.</p>

                                and Technical Assistance</hi></p>
                        <p>In discussions with United States officials regarding the mutual security
                            program, a number of problems and suggestions were presented.</p>
                        <p>Concern was expressed in almost every instance for the need for increased
                            emphasis on economic development in our assistance programs. The
                            objective is to raise the level of production of these countries to a
                            point which can sustain their economies without continuing financial
                            assistance from the United States. Especially in Korea, where the
                            economy cannot be expected to achieve viability for a long time because
                            of the special situation existing there (a suspended state of war), our
                            officials stress the need for getting on with capital investment as a
                            means of reducing future dependence on the United States Treasury.</p>
                        <p>In the Philippines, the large volume of underemployment in an economy
                            having such a rich store of untapped natural resources indicates a great
                            need for expanded economic development. In other countries of Southeast
                            Asia, natural resources abound but are not being adequately developed.
                            The minerals found in that area are in great demand in Japan as well as
                            in other industrial countries, but exploitation is not being carried
                            forward.</p>
                        <p>The task of economic development can best be done by private enterprise
                            and that must be encouraged. As stressed in the section on “Climate for
                            Private Foreign Investment”, appropriate investment laws and attitudes
                            toward foreign capital and management are prerequisites. We must work
                            toward this goal.</p>
                        <p>Our economic aid programs, however, can hasten the process of economic
                            development and lay the foundations for private investment. Certain
                            basic facilities, such as roads, ports, communications, and power, must
                            be available for the operation of modern business enterprises. Most of
                            these facilities necessarily have to be set up by government sponsorship
                            with government financing. Outside financial and technical assistance is
                            required to proceed with construction of these basic facilities, and our

                            />and more to economic development, can contribute greatly to this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>In some countries, there is need for basic geological surveys to
                            determine the nature of the mineral resources, their location, and other
                            characteristics. Because of the technical requirements and costs
                            involved, this job in most instances cannot reasonably be undertaken by
                            private enterprise. For us to provide such basic working tools through
                            our assistance programs makes possible the entry of foreign
                            entrepreneurs into the country.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it should be noted that it is a policy of the
                            International Cooperation Administration not to use Mutual Security
                            funds or counterpart funds to finance oil surveys in foreign countries.
                            In view of the need to accelerate the rate of economic development and
                            to reduce future dependence on United States assistance, it is suggested
                            that this policy be reviewed to determine whether its continuance is in
                            the interest of this country.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the technical assistance program, the advantage of
                            providing technicians through contracts with private business concerns
                            was emphasized, the thought being that this serves to reduce the area of
                            irritability on the part of the aid-recipient countries. It was pointed
                            out that the people in the underdeveloped countries are often sensitive
                            about being advised by other governments on how to do things, but are
                            less so when advised by private citizens.</p>
                        <p>The United States Operations Missions have found difficulty in recruiting
                            technical personnel in the United States. Essential programs have been
                            long delayed in many instances for lack of such personnel. Because
                            qualified technical personnel are often available in other industrial
                            countries—Japan in the Far East—it has been suggested that means be
                            found whereby more technical personnel may be brought in from other
                            countries for specific jobs.</p>
                        <p>A further recommendation was made that our staffs be redistributed so
                            that an increasing proportion of the American technical experts would
                            spend their full time working in the government offices of the
                            aid-recipient countries, or at construction sites or industrial plants.
                            While maintaining close relations with appropriate United States
                            agencies, they would thus not appear as part of a large centralized U.S.
                            Government organization from which the economy was being directed in the
                            colonial tradition.</p>

                        <p>United States officials in the field report that they are handicapped by
                            the long administrative delays in getting projects actually underway.
                            These delays often involve 18 to 24 months. United <pb n="42"
                                xml:id="pg_42" facs="0072"/>States officials in Korea, for example,
                            had not been informed in December 1956, of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                >ICA</gloss> program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.</p>
                        <p>While it is recognized that careful scrutiny of proposed programs is
                            necessary, delay is destructive of goodwill, especially in the case of
                            unsophisticated foreign officials who expect to see results follow
                            quickly from discussions in the field. One further result of long delays
                            is that conditions may have changed meanwhile, making programs less
                            suitable than when originally planned.</p>
                        <p>Part of the delay, and an additional source of irritation, is the use of
                            procedures which, though well-suited to advanced countries, are not
                            suited to the underdeveloped countries.</p>
                        <p>The antidote that is suggested is the granting of more flexibility and
                            authority to the field.</p>
                        <p>It has been the policy of this Government to insist that publicity be
                            given to United States aid in the recipient country. It has been
                            suggested that in certain instances where we wish to see a particular
                            friendly government strengthened, it may be politically advantageous to
                            the United States to avoid this and permit the nation to receive credit
                            for the aid program.</p>
                        <p>The United States may also derive goodwill and develop responsible
                            decision-making in the developing nations by encouraging countries not
                            only to suggest what is needed but to assume responsibility for
                            decisions with respect to aid programs even if some mistakes are
                            made.</p>
                        <p>One complaint registered in the field concerns the volume of paper work
                            required. A large staff is needed in the field just to “work for
                            Washington”. They have occasionally been required to submit voluminous
                            reports prepared according to instructions that were changed frequently,
                            with the result that operations were on a crash basis much of the time.
                            Some required reports were characterized as so elaborate that only a
                            handful of persons in Washington could possibly have time to read them,
                            let alone study them. As a result, additional reports of a duplicating
                            but more general nature are often called for. When this occurs, little
                            time is left to get the real job done.</p>

                        <p>One problem that was called to our attention concerns the number of
                            United States personnel assigned to developing countries.</p>
                        <p>This problem has two aspects. First, the American scale of living
                            transplanted to the host country often becomes a source of constant
                            irritation. This reaction is accentuated wherever the number of
                            Americans is large. Dependents add considerably to the total. Second,
                                <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0073"/>there may be more personnel
                            assigned to a country than is required to do the job.</p>
                        <p>The exceptionally heavy load of paper work described in the previous
                            section of the report increases the number of people required to be
                            assigned to foreign posts.</p>
                        <p>Continuous resurvey of the number of personnel assigned abroad is
                            urgently needed.</p>

                        agencies to submit specific proposals on how Soviet economic penetration

                        those which provided for the participation of private industry. The working

                        consisted of representatives from the Departments of State and the Treasury,

                            Activities in Underdeveloped Areas</hi></p>
                    <p>A. The Nature and Scope of Bloc Activities.</p>
                    <p>Since late 1953, the Sino-Soviet Bloc has employed trade promotion, seemingly
                        easy credits, and technical assistance on a growing scale as a tool of its
                        diplomacy in underdeveloped areas. During this period credits extended for
                        development exceeded $1 billion; arms deals involved an additional $360
                        million. Technical assistance personnel sent abroad for a month or more in
                        1956 numbered at least 1400. Bloc trade with underdeveloped countries during
                        the first 6–8 months of 1956 moved at an annual rate of about 25 percent
                        above the 1955 level.</p>
                    <p>The economic offensive has been largely concentrated to date in Yugoslavia,
                        India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, Burma, and Cambodia, <pb n="45"
                            xml:id="pg_45" facs="0075"/>in all of which the Bloc clearly hopes to
                        promote its political objectives—notably strengthening of neutralism,
                        disruption of defensive alliances, and reduction of Western influences.
                        Economic considerations have also entered the Bloc calculations,
                        particularly as regards trade promotion, since the more industrialized
                        countries of the Bloc have reached a point where an expanded exchange of
                        their capital goods for food and raw materials would be economically
                        advantageous.</p>
                    <p>The Bloc has sought to exploit economic difficulties and aspirations in
                        pursuit of its economic offensive. It has particularly capitalized on its
                        ability to make large scale bulk purchases of food and raw materials from
                        underdeveloped countries where they face soft markets in the Free World, and
                        to supply development goods for arms in exchange. On the other hand the
                        Bloc’s appeal to nationalistic fervor, anti-colonialism and neutralism, and
                        Bloc willingness to choose sides and exploit regional political differences
                        have been at least as important determinants of receptivity to Bloc
                        overtures. In some cases such receptivity has been affected by recent
                        developments in Hungary.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, Bloc activities were sparked by a willingness to provide
                        arms, and by an apparent readiness to adjust economic relations to meet
                        short-term needs of the anti-Western Arab nations and make promises for the
                        future. The Bloc has exploited the rising tide of Arab nationalism, fostered
                        existing anti-Western attitudes, fed upon Arab hostility towards Israel, and
                        sought to promote the general image of Soviet support for Arab aspirations.
                        Arms under credits totaling at least $330 million have been provided to
                        Egypt, Syria, and Yemen. Assistance for economic development in the region
                        has so far been on a small scale, but there are signs of possible expansion.
                        The Bloc has also increased strictly commercial relations with the area,
                        particularly with Egypt and Syria.</p>
                    <p>In South and Southeast Asia, Bloc economic activities have included the
                        provision of long-term developmental credits and some grants, technical
                        assistance, expanded trade relations, and in one country—Afghanistan—the
                        provision of arms. The Bloc has been able to expand trade with the area. In
                        addition to appealing to the economic desires of the South and Southeast
                        Asian countries, the Bloc has played advantageously upon the political
                        environment. Their appeal has included such things as: suspicions of Western
                        motivations and existing ties with the West; socialist predilections which
                        may make the Soviet model for economic development attractive; the desire to
                        stay away from close identification with anti- Communist alliances; a
                        positive desire for neutrality coupled with a willingness to take from both
                        sides as evidence of this non-involvement; local political differences among
                        countries in the region.</p>

                    <p>The Bloc economic offensive in Yugoslavia sought to take advantage of
                        grandiose aspirations for industrializing and strengthening the Yugoslav
                        economy, but was pointed largely to securing the rapprochement of Yugoslavia
                        with the Soviet Bloc. Trade relations between Yugoslavia and the Bloc, which
                        had been cut back sharply after Tito’s break with the Soviets, were expanded
                        through a network of trade agreements, and large-scale long-term development
                        credits were extended. However, the recently renewed Soviet-Yugoslav
                        ideological and political controversy has been accompanied by indications of
                        a decline in Soviet readiness to implement its expanded economic program in
                        Yugoslavia. While this is a special case, it may give pause to other
                        countries contemplating reliance on Bloc supply.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America, and in such pro-Western countries as Turkey, Greece, Iran,
                        Pakistan, Portugal, and Iceland the willingness to expand economic relations
                        with the Bloc depends very largely on grounds of economic advantage or
                        necessity, and these countries are confident that their institutions and
                        alliances are sufficient to withstand the Communist threat. Bloc offers to
                        extend long-term credits have been generally rebuffed and the principal
                        channel for Bloc economic activities remains through expanded trade
                        relations. Bloc economic activities in Africa (other than Egypt) have to
                        date been minor. However, Bloc willingness to exploit opportunities which
                        may arise in the newly independent countries can be expected.</p>
                    <p>The Bloc assistance program has capitalized on the fact that most
                        underdeveloped countries want more capital and trained personnel to meet
                        their pressing demands for rapid economic growth. Practically all Bloc
                        credits have been provided for projects in the public sector. While many of
                        the projects are of types which might be suitable for private investment,
                        the recipient countries have generally allotted them to the public sector
                        under development concepts and programs envisaging a large share of direct
                        government activity.</p>
                    <p>In addition to economic considerations, most countries which have accepted
                        aid stress “neutralism” in their foreign policy. Nominally, at least, they
                        are receptive to Bloc aid as evidence of their neutrality; and the
                        availability of private Western capital would probably have little influence
                        on their willingness to accept aid from the Soviets, particularly since all
                        of the recipients tend to underestimate the dangers of the economic
                        offensive and feel well able to control any increase of Communist influence
                        in their countries.</p>
                    <p>Without attempting to minimize such Soviet inroads upon Free World trade,
                        Free World economic relations greatly overshadow those of the Bloc. Free
                        World economic activity remains, for the <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47"
                            facs="0077"/>most part, on a private commercial and investment basis, in
                        contrast to the Bloc’s reliance on state trading. Over 95 percent of the
                        trade of the underdeveloped countries is with the Free World. The long run
                        advantages of trading with Western private enterprise for quality goods at
                        free market prices without political dangers should, it is hoped, become
                        increasingly evident to the underdeveloped nations.</p>
                    <p>While Bloc trade with the Free World has been growing at a rapid rate, it
                        still constitutes less than 3 percent of world trade. Although the Bloc has
                        extended over $1 billion of developmental credits to underdeveloped
                        countries since 1954, Free World private and governmental credits and
                        investments to the same areas dwarf this figure. The United States alone in
                        the fiscal year 1956 provided for about $1.6 billion of economic aid, and
                        about $620 million of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 credits to the
                        underdeveloped areas. Export-Import Bank and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss> credits and commitments authorized for this area totaled
                        $950 million in 1956. Additionally, U.S. total private investments and
                        reinvestments in underdeveloped countries increased net by about $1.5
                        billion in 1956.</p>
                    <p>However, in any comparison of Soviet Bloc and Free World foreign economic
                        activities, recognition should be given to the fact that the Bloc’s economic
                        offensive has been concentrated to date on particular underdeveloped and
                        vulnerable areas, where Bloc activities have had a significant impact.</p>
                    <p>B. Soviet Capabilities and the Outlook for Continuation of the Economic
                        Offensive.</p>
                    <p>Exports under present trade or credit agreements with the Free World
                        represent a very small fraction of total Bloc output and could be further
                        expanded without jeopardizing domestic investment targets or creating
                        serious Bloc dependence on foreign suppliers. The scope of new Bloc
                        assistance commitments will probably depend largely on Bloc calculations of
                        the potential political gains. New aid commitments may be entered into at a
                        slower rate than in 1955–56, partly because the USSR may estimate that it
                        already has agreements with the most susceptible countries and that
                        additional assistance to countries already receiving or scheduled to receive
                        aid would produce minimal political returns until current projects have been
                        implemented. Moreover, the Soviet leadership, preoccupied with problems of
                        Bloc solidarity and facing the prospect of present and future economic
                        concessions to its own Bloc satellites and Communist China, may be less
                        confident than a year ago and may question the wisdom of substantially
                        expanding foreign economic assistance outside the Bloc at this time. Trade
                        might, nevertheless, be somewhat expanded to reap economic as well as
                        political gains.</p>
                    <p>The new economic tactics are likely to persist as an important element of
                        Soviet policy in what the Kremlin has described as a <pb n="48"
                            xml:id="pg_48" facs="0078"/>period of “Competitive coexistence.” The
                        programs begun over the past two years have developed a momentum of their
                        own which should produce a steadily expanding level of Bloc trade with
                        underdeveloped countries and enlarged technical assistance activities as
                        present commitments are fulfilled. The Bloc can also be expected to continue
                        to be alert to situations susceptible to exploitation and offering a promise
                        of political gain in exchange for economic assistance.</p>

                            Penetration with United States Private Investment and Trade</hi></p>
                    <p>Basic U.S. effort should be addressed to strengthening the national
                        institutions and economies of the underdeveloped areas if their resistance
                        to Soviet penetration is to be increased. Both government and private
                        enterprise must play a role in meeting this threat.</p>
                    <p>Neither of these can alone adequately meet the problem. However, the greater
                        the successful effort which can be asserted by private industry, with or
                        without government assistance, the less will be the need for U.S. Government
                        aid to the underdeveloped countries, the greater will be their industrial
                        development along democratic lines and the more quickly will they achieve
                        effective strength against Soviet penetration.</p>
                    <p>This paper deals with the ways to increase private U.S. investment and trade
                        in the less developed areas as an effective measure to cope with Soviet
                        penetration of such areas. Clearly, efforts to increase private trade and
                        investment is not a sufficient answer to the Soviet penetration issue but it
                        can be an important part of the answer. While this importance will vary from
                        country to country and may find little current applicability in some
                        countries, such efforts should nevertheless be facilitated and increased
                        wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>Although the problems and dangers in a number of underdeveloped areas such as
                        Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, India, Indonesia and Burma are highlighted by
                        current Soviet penetration efforts, the trade and investment problem posed
                        for U.S. private industry is much broader geographically. That problem
                        covers all underdeveloped countries where any significant advantage from
                        current or later penetration may accrue to the Soviet Bloc. At the same time
                        it is recognized that the action program proposed in Part V of this paper
                        must vary in application and priority from country to country.</p>
                    <p>It is expected, however, that implementing agencies will make appropriate
                        determination as to which countries particular projects would concern and
                        the priorities to be given them. In making such determination it is expected
                        that implementing agencies will base <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0079"
                        />their judgments on the significance which a particular project may have
                        both to the economic development of the country concerned, the strengthening
                        of its institutions against Soviet penetration and the promotion of other
                        relevant U.S. interests in the area. It is recognized that, while in some
                        countries the private trade and investment climate may be satisfactory, in
                        many countries (particularly certain of those now being penetrated) it is
                        quite unsatisfactory currently, and any marked increase in U.S. trade and
                        investment must be preceded by a major change in such climate.</p>
                    <p>The action program proposes that U.S. private industry be encouraged and
                        assisted in increasing private trade and investment in underdeveloped areas.
                        In the end, success in this effort will depend on the effort and initiative
                        which private industry exerts.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">IV. Recommended Action Program</hi></p>
                    <p>From the recommendations submitted to it by the Subcommittee on Soviet
                        Penetration and other recommendations suggested during its deliberations,
                        the Working Group has selected those proposed actions which seem likely to
                        be effective in increasing U.S. private trade and investment with
                        underdeveloped areas and which would contribute most to strengthening the
                        areas against Soviet penetration. In each case an attempt has been made to
                        describe the action program in sufficiently specific terms to provide a
                        general but clear idea as to what is intended. It is anticipated that the
                        conversion of the program into more specific action projects will be left to
                        further assignment to agencies which may be selected to implement various
                        parts of the program.</p>
                    <p>Although an attempt was made by the Working Group to assign relative
                        priorities to the several proposed action programs, the result was
                        unsatisfactory. It was concluded that all proposed actions were desirable
                        and the priority of their application would be largely determined by
                        implicit conditions facing implementing agencies.</p>
                    <p>In compiling this action program reference has been made to the report

                                <item>The Subcommittee disapproved a proposal that rapid tax
                                    write-offs should be offered to encourage United States private
                                    investment in underdeveloped areas. It was the view of the
                                    Subcommittee that this proposal should not be adopted because
                                    the domestic rapid tax write-off program is drawing to a close
                                    and because of the doubtful effectiveness of the proposal. It
                                    was also the view of the Treasury Department that the proposal
                                    would be contrary to the present position of the Treasury
                                    Department that there should be no special tax relief or
                                    benefits until a general tax reduction has been provided. The
                                    Commerce Department’s view was that such a program would be
                                    effective and that the closing out of the domestic program was
                                    not relevant since that program had accomplished its

                                Policy</hi></p>
                        <p>The broad objective of United States foreign economic policy is identical
                            with that of our general foreign policy and, in fact, of the over-all
                            policy of the United States Government: to protect and advance the
                            national interest, to improve the security and well-being of the United
                            States and its people.</p>
                        <p>This broad objective of our foreign economic policy has three major
                            components:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. To promote the economic strength of
                                the United States.</hi></p>
                        <p>This is the traditional objective of foreign economic policy: expanding
                            foreign markets for the products of our factories, mines and farms;
                            insuring ready access to overseas sources of supplies needed by our
                            economy; permitting the nation to take reasonable advantage of the
                            economies which flow from specialization in production throughout the
                            world; improving conditions for U.S. citizens to invest and do business
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>Foreign trade is one of the most important business activities of the
                            United States. Statistics tell an impressive story of the vital role of
                            our international commerce. It is estimated, for example, that the
                            families of at least 41/2 million American workers, or about 7 percent
                            of our labor force, gain their livelihood from foreign trade. A
                            commensurate share of the profits of American business firms is
                            traceable to foreign trade activities. As for exports alone, the value
                            of U.S. goods marketed abroad last year exceeded that of all non-farm
                            home building, or of consumer purchases of automobiles, or of farmers’
                            gross receipts from either crops or livestock.</p>
                        <p>Exports comprise about 9 percent of the value of our production of
                            movable goods—8 percent for manufactured goods and 11 percent <pb n="60"
                                xml:id="pg_60" facs="0090"/>for agricultural products. For many
                            specific commodities, the proportions of U.S. output sold abroad run
                            substantially higher than the average—for example, according to the
                            latest available annual figures in each case, about 19 percent for
                            trucks, 40 percent for tracklaying tractors, 11 percent for machine
                            tools, 26 percent for construction and mining equipment, 14 percent for
                            coal, and between 25 and 40 percent for cotton, wheat, rice, fats and
                            oils, and tobacco. The vital importance of exports in such cases is
                            beyond dispute; and even among those manufacturing industries with
                            below-average ratios, the great majority depend upon foreign markets for
                            at least some significant share of their sales, profits, and jobs.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the available ratios for many specific
                            commodities seriously understate the true importance of export markets
                            for their producers, since they cover only exports of an industry’s
                            products in the form in which they leave that country. Much of an
                            industry’s output may be exported only in some other form after further
                            processing by other industries, or, even though not physically exported,
                            may be utilized by other industries in production for export. This is
                            particularly true of such primary manufacturing industries as iron and
                            steel or nonferrous metals.</p>
                        <p>Through foreign trade the United States obtains from abroad a wide range
                            of goods which are not otherwise available here at all or in adequate
                            quantities for industrial needs or consumer demand. Many of these
                            imports are vital to keep factory wheels turning and assembly lines
                            moving. We obtain from foreign sources about one-sixth of our crude
                            petroleum, almost one-fourth of our iron ore, one-third of our copper
                            and rubber, over one-half of our raw wool, and the great bulk of our
                            supplies of tin, nickel and newsprint. Most of our supplies of various
                            ferroalloying ores and metals come from abroad as do industrial
                            diamonds, mica and asbestos.</p>
                        <p>Altogether, about one-fifth of the crude and semi-manufactured goods
                            imported by the United States in 1956 were officially classified as
                            strategic materials for stockpiling purposes, and another one-fifth
                            consisted of materials (other than those in the stockpile group)
                            obtainable wholly or almost exclusively from foreign sources. Many other
                            raw material imports also represent high proportions of U.S.
                            requirements, and still others supplement predominantly domestic
                            supplies to an important degree.</p>
                        <p>Imports of foods and manufactured goods bulk smaller in the total than
                            those of industrial materials. Nevertheless, every American household
                            enjoys the variety contributed to our established consumption pattern by
                            imports both of foreign foodstuffs and manufactured consumer goods.</p>

                        <p>This objective has become of major importance within the past decade. We
                            recognize, first of all, that a prosperous world brings economic
                            advantages to our own country. Furthermore, foreign economic growth is
                            necessary for the establishment and maintenance of stable, peaceful and
                            friendly societies abroad. Economic stagnation is a source of unrest
                            which can threaten political stability and, eventually, the peace of the
                            world we are so earnestly seeking to make durable and just. The moderate
                            leadership groups which are in power in most of the less developed
                            countries are under tremendous pressure to speed millions of their
                            countrymen into the Twentieth Century. Failure of these leaders to
                            achieve reasonable economic progress would result in these governments
                            being replaced by others more extreme, more likely to be totalitarian,
                            either of Communist or indigenous origin, and more likely to resort to
                            violence as a means of achieving their objectives. Economic strength
                            abroad also is a prerequisite to the building of solid military forces
                            with which to deter potential Communist subversion or aggression.</p>

                                the free world.</hi></p>
                        <p>Our present foreign policy is built upon a web of relations among
                            virtually all of the free nations. Through the North Atlantic Treaty
                            Organization and the Baghdad Pact, through the Organization of American
                            States, through a variety of other organizations and treaties, we have
                            undertaken to work with friendly countries in building our common
                            strength and in defending ourselves against Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>These ties have not been and could not be purely political or military.
                            Without adequate economic support they would be weak and unreliable.
                            Modern power depends upon the basic economic strength of the nations
                            involved. This in turn depends upon the efficient use of domestic and
                            foreign resources, and is reduced when each nation tries to build on its
                            own resources alone.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, economic disputes can weaken or destroy political and military
                            alliances. For most countries, it is vital to have easy access to
                            foreign markets and foreign sources of basic materials and capital. The
                            jobs and well-being of their people depend on it. Most of our allies are
                            particularly sensitive to this because they depend much more on foreign
                            trade than does the United States.</p>
                        <p>Countries of the free world are under external and internal pressure to
                            align themselves with the Communist bloc or at least to become neutral
                            in the great power struggle between Communism and the way of life
                            represented by the democracies. To oppose this <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"
                                facs="0092"/>pressure the United States has used its economic
                            resources and political leadership.</p>
                        <p>The most difficult problems are posed in the developing countries,
                            particularly those in Asia and Africa. Between our country and those
                            countries today are vast differences in culture, language and social
                            tradition as well as economic attainment. Mutual confidence must be
                            established. This cannot be achieved by words alone.</p>
                        <p>By working together with the free world countries for their and our
                            economic advancement and for the building of a durable and just
                            international economic order, we can do much to achieve our broad
                            aspirations as a nation. We can demonstrate the community of interest of
                            the peoples of the free world. We can encourage the growth of the idea
                            of democratic and limited government and the basic values on which this
                            rests.</p>

                            Policies</hi></p>
                        <p>To achieve these objectives the United States Government has followed
                            three basic economic policies: the expansion of trade, in both goods and
                            services, through the gradual and reciprocal reduction of unjustifiable
                            governmental and private barriers; the promotion of private investment;
                            and the provision of mutual assistance. These policies and their roles
                            are discussed below.</p>
                        <p>These three policy subjects, however, do not begin to exhaust the immense
                            range of economic matters that are dealt with in our international
                            relations. There is the complex and difficult field of aviation policy.
                            There are problems of shipping, telecommunications, agricultural surplus
                            disposal, currency exchange, East-West trade, and special problems
                            surrounding key commodities such as petroleum, cotton, wheat, and
                            rubber. Our participation in United Nations economic programs is a
                            subject in itself. Foreign policy today is pervaded by economics, and in
                            all these activities the Government seeks closer cooperation with other
                            peoples to the mutual advantage of them and us.</p>
                        <p>These various components of foreign economic policy are inextricably
                            interrelated. Actions taken with respect to one have a bearing on one or
                            several other components. None can be treated in isolation. They form an
                            integrated whole.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">A. Expansion of trade.</hi></p>
                        <p>The trade and financial policies of the United States Government are
                            designed to help to achieve all three basic objectives of foreign
                            economic policy; to increase the economic strength of the United States,
                            to increase the strength of other countries and to promote the unity of
                            the free world. To the fullest practicable degree <pb n="63"
                                xml:id="pg_63" facs="0093"/>they call for the gradual and reciprocal
                            reduction of unjustifiable public and private barriers to trade and
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>Governmental restrictions have in the past throttled mutually profitable
                            world commerce to the detriment of the United States and of every other
                            nation. To remove unjustifiable barriers and to promote the productive
                            interchange of goods and services is a major task of United States
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>This task is undertaken primarily through the trade agreements program
                            including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) and through the International
                            Monetary Fund (<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>). Through the trade
                            agreements program we seek the gradual, selective and reciprocal
                            reduction of tariffs and the elimination of quantitative restrictions on
                            imports and of other governmental barriers to trade. Through the Fund,
                            we seek the promotion of a sound financial basis for the development of
                            international economic relations, including the maintenance of
                            equitable, stable exchange rates, the provision of short-term financial
                            resources to countries short of foreign exchange, and the elimination of
                            governmental restrictions on international payments. Experience through
                            the years has demonstrated clearly the superiority of multilateral
                            discussions and negotiations over bilaterals in achieving the objectives
                            of United States policy in these fields.</p>
                        <p>By removing or reducing barriers to foreign trade, the United States
                            contributes materially to its own economic advancement and,
                            simultaneously, to that of other countries. When foreign nations
                            reciprocate in tariff reduction, as they must do, and remove
                            restrictions on international payments, the stimulus to our and their
                            economies is increased.</p>
                        <p>The United States over the years has taken the lead in this program. We
                            have undertaken this task not only because our foreign commerce is
                            greater than that of any other country, but also because of our basic
                            philosophical attitude towards the role of government in economic life.
                            The general philosophy underlying the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> is a
                            practical application of the emphasis in our political thought on the
                            importance of limiting the role of government in economic life and
                            expanding the opportunities for individual choice, initiative and
                            experimentation.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> are important forums for considering differences which
                            now frequently arise between friendly nations in the area of trade and
                            payments. These differences are largely created as governments,
                            attempting to protect the industrial, agricultural or financial
                            resources of their countries, adopt measures which come in conflict with
                            the objectives of other nations.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there are U.S. Government policies designed to reduce or
                            eliminate abroad non-governmental barriers to trade, that is, private
                            restrictive business arrangements, and to encourage free <pb n="64"

                            these fields are designed to aid American businessmen to operate more
                            freely in foreign commerce and to strengthen the economies of the free
                            world countries.</p>

                        <p>In the interest of United States economic growth—the development of
                            foreign markets and sources of supply—and in the interest of assisting
                            foreign economic growth, the United States has encouraged the outflow of
                            private capital. Private investment not only provides financing but it
                            also takes with it the managerial, entrepreneurial and technical talents
                            which are essential for successful enterprise but are seriously lacking
                            in the less developed countries.</p>
                        <p>Some of the measures employed, such as Treaties of Friendship, Commerce
                            and Navigation, are designed to improve the investment climate abroad.
                            Others, such as loans to business from the International Finance
                            Corporation and the Export-Import Bank, and the removal of tax
                            impediments, offer a direct stimulus to United States private capital to
                            go abroad.</p>
                        <p>As the less developed countries achieve a substantial degree of economic
                            growth and as they achieve a greater degree of trust in us and
                            confidence in themselves, the opportunities for private capital will
                            grow. The opportunities are already large in much of Latin America. In
                            the long run, private capital can reduce the demands on the United

                            Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development have
                            been major factors in the growth of both economic strength and a sense
                            of community in the free world.</p>
                        <p>The success of the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Marshall</persName> Plan in
                            Western Europe was striking. Economic output quickly reached and
                            exceeded pre-war levels. Economic nationalism, which in the pre-war and
                            immediate post-war periods dominated European governmental policy, has
                            had serious setbacks. Quantitative restrictions upon European trade have
                            been substantially reduced. Limitations on the use of the major European
                            currencies, particularly in the non-dollar world, have been virtually
                            eliminated. U.S. economic aid there, of course, has ceased.</p>
                        <p>The problems of the less developed countries are much more difficult than
                            those of Western Europe. Many of the former are already overpopulated in
                            relation to their low levels of production. Moreover, the populations
                            are growing rapidly as death rates fall <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                facs="0095"/>sharply with the introduction of low-cost health
                            measures. Capital is lacking and domestic savings are low. The labor
                            force needs to acquire the basic skills required for a modern economy;
                            these requirements vary from learning to read simple instructions to the
                            strengthening of high-level manpower resources, especially managerial,
                            supervisory, technical and scientific talents. A business or
                            entrepreneurial class must be created or enlarged. In general, basic
                            changes in attitudes and institutions are necessary. Many of these
                            problems can only be resolved slowly and require long-term and
                            persistent measures for their solution.</p>

                        <p>Modern U.S. trade policy has its roots in the Trade Agreements Act of
                                1934.<note n="8" xml:id="d13fn8">The Trade Agreements Act (<gloss
                                    target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 316), enacted June 12, 1934, was
                                embodied in Section 350 of the revised Tariff Act of 1930 and
                                entitled “Promotion of Foreign Trade”; for text, see 48 Stat.
                                943.</note> Our trade policy rests on the doctrine of reducing
                            unjustifiable government interference to allow international trade to
                            expand in response to market forces. Foreign trade allows nations to
                            take advantage of the specialization of production which is the
                            distinguishing feature of modern economic life. It is the international
                            counterpart of the domestic specialization of function which has been
                            one of the foundations of U.S. national strength.</p>
                        <p>As discussed above, foreign trade is of great importance to the American
                            people both as consumers and producers. The world’s largest economic
                            power, the United States, is also the world’s largest foreign trader. We
                            have a large stake in a healthy, expanding international trade.</p>
                        <p>As important as foreign trade is to U.S. employment, production and
                            consumption, it is even greater importance to most of the nations of the
                            free world which cannot match the size and diversity of U.S. natural and
                            human resources. For the major industrial countries such as the United
                            Kingdom, West Germany and France, the ratio of exports to gross national
                            production is three to four times as great as for the United States. For
                            smaller advanced nations, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and
                            Switzerland, it is five to nine times as great. For many of the
                            underdeveloped countries, exports are the single largest component of
                            the market part of their economy.</p>
                        <p>In fact, trade with the United States alone is of significant proportions
                            for many countries. Over two-thirds of total exports of Colombia, Mexico
                            and Cuba go to the United States. For Canada the ratio amounts to 60
                            percent, while for Brazil and the Philippines it is at least 50
                            percent.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0096"/>
                        <p>For many particular commodities the United States is the dominant market.
                            For example, Chile sends two-thirds of her total copper production to
                            the United States; Cuba sells us half of her sugar; Indonesia sells
                            one-quarter of her rubber; Bolivia, one-third of her tin; Brazil, over
                            one-half of her coffee production.</p>
                        <p>Even Western European countries with relatively large markets on the
                            continent depend to an important extent on exports to the United States.
                            Specific industries depend heavily upon the American market. For
                            example, Switzerland exports to the United States over half of her total
                            production of Emmenthaler and Gruyere cheese and over one-third of her
                            production of watches and watch movements; United Kingdom sends about
                            one-third of her total production of Scotch whiskey to America; Portugal
                            exports about 40 percent of her cork production to this country.</p>
                        <p>These facts suggest the extent to which the United States has come to
                            occupy a dominant role in critical segments of the economies of many
                            foreign countries. A decline in sales to the United States fundamentally
                            affects income and savings abroad. The availability and growth of the
                            American market is of vital importance to them.</p>
                        <p>The trade agreements program is designed to contribute to the development
                            of mutually beneficial international trade. In so doing it plays an
                            important role in the achievement of our foreign economic policy
                            objectives. Experience with the program since 1934 demonstrates this
                            conclusively. The Executive Branch strongly favors continuation of the
                            trade agreements program including the extension of the Trade Agreements
                            Act. The life of the program should be extended by the Congress for a
                            sufficient period to provide the essential stability to the program and
                            adequate authority to vouchsafe and expand the gains that have been made
                            in world trade.</p>
                        <p>The trade agreements program is designed to be realistic and practical.
                            It is recognized that abrupt lowering of barriers to trade can create
                            serious problems in our own as well as foreign economies. Some U.S.
                            industries are particularly sensitive to import competition. A sudden
                            increase in imports may have relatively important effects on their
                            output, profits and employment. The fact that these industries tend to
                            be localized in particular areas of the country increases the magnitude
                            and seriousness of the problem. Thus, the policy of the U.S. Government
                            has been one of gradual and selective tariff reduction, one which gives
                            public consideration to each item before any reduction in tariffs is
                            made, and which provides opportunity for reconsideration when serious
                            injury occurs or is threatened.</p>
                        <p>The case-by-case approach to tariff reductions permits the Executive
                            Branch to administer the program in a way to provide reasonable
                            assurance that serious injury will not be threatened any <pb n="67"
                                xml:id="pg_67" facs="0097"/>industry as a result of a tariff
                            negotiation. The peril point findings of the U.S. Tariff Commission, as
                            required by the Trade Agreements legislation, play an important role to
                            this end. Likewise, provision for reconsideration of a tariff reduction
                            when serious injury does occur or is threatened makes possible the use
                            of appropriate measures for the removal of such threat or serious
                            injury. The Executive Branch subscribes fully to the principles
                            underlying both the peril point and the escape clause provisions of the
                            Trade Agreements Act.</p>
                        <p>The special consideration given in the Act to protecting essential
                            defense industries has the full support of the Executive Branch. So also
                            do the limitations on imports of agricultural products as provided for
                            within the trade agreements program, and in the controlling legislation,
                            in those instances in which this country has a policy of supporting
                            domestic prices and as a result limits the production or sale of the
                            domestic products.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> has been the instrument by
                            which thirty-five nations, accounting for 80 percent of world trade,
                            have agreed to reduce tariffs and to eliminate quantitative restrictions
                            and other harmful discriminatory practices. It has provided a forum
                            where governments can discuss their trade problems and submit
                            complaints. In this forum differences of policies can be discussed and
                            discord among friendly countries can be reduced. The effectiveness of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> can be greatly increased by
                            establishment of an administrative unit, the Organization for Trade
                            Cooperation. The Executive Branch will again urge the Congress to
                            authorize membership in the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The results of the trade agreements program have been gratifying in terms
                            of reductions in unjustifiable trade barriers, the expansion of world
                            trade, the economic growth of the entire free world, and the development
                            of closer, friendlier international relations. Continuation of this
                            record of achievement depends on the ability of the United States to
                            carry on a constructive program. This is in our own interest as well as
                            that of the entire free world.</p>
                        <p>Much has been accomplished but much remains to be done. Moreover, there
                            is always the danger that if momentum is lost there will be a lapse into
                            economic nationalism around the free world. This lapse may be confined
                            to individual countries or may be expanded to groups of nations which
                            would have as a major objective discrimination against American
                            goods.</p>
                        <p>Regional trading plans of all sorts are being proposed throughout the
                            world. Whether such plans, particularly the European Common Market and
                            Free Trade Area, will contribute their full potential to the development
                            of world trade or become restrictive depends very largely on the
                            attitudes and outlook toward trade adopted by <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68"
                                facs="0098"/>the member countries. In part, this depends on the
                            example the United States sets in its own trade policy.</p>

                    <p>On July 16, 1957, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy decided to hold
                        regular meetings on Soviet economic penetration activities to determine
                        appropriate action by the United States Government. At its meeting on
                        October 17, the Council again discussed the topic of Soviet economic
                        penetration. It “considered the problems presented by the readiness of the
                        Soviet Bloc to purchase commodities of underdeveloped countries and provide
                        capital, equipment and technical know-how to gain positions of major
                        influence, regardless of the economic profit of the venture.” (<gloss

                        Soviet Economic Penetration.</p>
                    <p>For a long time, the Department of Defense has been concerned about the
                        accelerating Sino-Soviet campaign of economic penetration in the Free World.
                        We realize that combating this campaign is an extremely intricate problem,
                        complicated by psychological, political, and other factors which are not the
                        primary responsibility of this Department. Our concern arises partly from
                        the fact that Sino-Soviet bloc success in orienting Free World nations
                        toward the bloc would <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0099"/>weaken their
                        participation in Free World mutual security programs, thus causing the U.S.
                        to shoulder a heavier military security burden. A case in point is the
                        Soviet active support of the development of air capabilities, civil and
                        military, of Egypt, Syria, and Yemen. The economic bonds that the Soviets
                        are fastening upon these Middle East countries and the widespread
                        penetration of the area by Soviet personnel create conditions which the
                        Soviets hope will make Communism flourish. This development is a direct
                        threat to the security of U.S. air bases in neighboring areas, as well as to
                        the security of the entire Baghdad Pact region.</p>
                    <p>The continuing publication of the biweekly and periodic summary reports on
                        “Sino-Soviet Bloc Economic Activities in Underdeveloped Areas” has furnished
                        an excellent foundation of facts of the situation and a delineation of
                        certain Soviet action patterns. The <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>
                        Subcommittee on Soviet Economic Penetration, in March of this year, made
                        some useful action recommendations.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> Many useful suggestions and
                        recommendations were contained in studies prepared last spring for the
                        Senate Special Committee to Study the Foreign Aid Program.<note n="3"

                            target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> in its meetings in July and October was
                        also of interest. However, we do not yet appear to be equipped to take
                        positive steps to counter Soviet activity.</p>
                    <p>There is not yet any specific policy guidance on Sino-Soviet economic
                        penetration, nor any focal group to which problems can be referred and which
                        can recommend or direct countermeasures to be taken. Various individual
                        cases (e.g., the utilization of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                        Finnmarks) have been referred to the Operations Coordinating Board.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">The Operations Coordinating Board was established
                            by Executive Order 10483, signed by President <persName

                            Members were the Under Secretary of State (chairman), the Deputy
                            Secretary of Defense, the Director of the Foreign Operations
                            Administration, the Director of Central Intelligence, and a Special

                            dated February 28, 1955, the membership was broadened to include the
                            Director of the U.S. Information Agency. For texts of the Executive

                        geographic basis and is concerned with a multitude of varied problems
                        affecting the respective areas. The <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>
                        Subcommittee on Soviet Economic Penetration has made a study and
                        recommendations concerning the role of private enterprise in countering the
                        bloc economic offensive, but apparently it has no means to initiate action.
                        A <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> subcommittee is studying the
                        problems, and has assisted in a solution of a few <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70"

                        because of lack of U.S. leadership.</p>
                    <p>In the belief that the seriousness of the Sino-Soviet economic offensive
                        requires positive steps toward counteraction, we submit the following
                        suggestions for your consideration: <list>

                            <item>The appointment of a high-level interdepartmental group to

                                to take action itself or which might recommend actions to be taken
                                by the Department or Departments concerned. This group might be a
                                special committee of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> or
                                the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, or it might be a special

                                small staff of experts in the various fields of action which must be
                                coordinated in order to effectuate economic penetration
                                actions.</item>

                    <p>There undoubtedly will be differing views as to how the details of
                        organization should be worked out. The Department of Defense favors,
                        however, a plan of action along these lines. Otherwise, the bloc, by its
                        economic offensive, may attack areas of the Free World which it dare not try
                        to take by military action.</p>

                    <p>I am sure that each of you has been disturbed, as I have, that our studies on
                        the subject of Soviet economic penetration have so far produced so little
                        that is specific and effective by way of countering this program. It seems
                        to be an unusually baffling problem when it comes to bringing it out of the
                        general into the definite.</p>

                    <p>You will have in mind, I am sure, the following paragraph, which I quote from
                        the letter of July 10, 1956, by which the President appointed me to my
                        present responsibilities:</p>
                    <p>“As a part of this mission, I shall look to you and your associates for the
                        development of foreign economic policies and programs designed to meet the
                        special problems created by Communist economic activities in underdeveloped
                        areas of the free world.”<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">For text of the

                    <p>It seems clear to me that what we need is a small unit somewhere in the
                        Government whose sole responsibility would be to keep abreast of Soviet
                        economic penetration activities, and, in cooperation with appropriate
                        agencies, to prepare recommendations for countermeasures for consideration

                                past ad hoc procedure under Section 22 and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> had met the U.S. problem without
                                hurting the Canadian economy too much and it would be preferable
                                that this procedure could be continued. He stated that Canada would
                                support the U.S. on such a basis. He emphasized, however, that a
                                general waiver probably would cause the imposition of tariffs and
                                other obstructions by many countries to protect their agriculture
                                and the chances of getting these additional restrictions lifted
                                would be very slender. Other countries would, for financial reasons,
                                prefer to resort to such restrictions rather than continue to give
                                subsidies to the domestic agriculture. The United States request for
                                a waiver would give them a good excuse to follow that course.</p>

                                    >GATT</gloss> rather than going along with the general waiver,
                                since many groups in Canada felt that it would be preferable to
                                trade with the United States on a bilateral basis as in the

                            obligations but that the U.S., which is Canada’s chief customer does

                                difficult to persuade and educate the people generally as to what is
                                in our enlightened interest. He noted that some legislators see the
                                trade and tariff problem as it affects their local areas rather than
                                the nation, and this affects their attitude on trade legislation. He
                                added that the President is not discouraged by the past development
                                of his foreign economic policy and that he hopes to obtain the
                                enactment of legislation this year that will enable him to push
                                ahead with the foreign economic program that he announced last year
                                and which he will again outline to the Congress on January 10. He
                                noted the introduction in Congress of HR-1, the Trade Agreements
                                Extension Act of 1955.<note n="8" xml:id="d17fn8">Public Law 86,
                                    enacted June 21, 1955; for text, see 69 Stat. 162.</note></p>
                            <p>The Secretary said that our views, which he felt are also those of
                                the Canadians, is that a free world united by strong and close trade
                                ties is indispensable to the fullest economic strength and cohesion
                                of the free countries.</p>
                            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that
                                the practical occasion and need for the waiver we are requesting at
                                Geneva will diminish as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1"
                                    >Benson</persName>’s programs for production adjustments and
                                surplus disposals go forward. He mentioned specifically, for
                                example, the beneficial use of surpluses in aid to Yugoslavia and
                                Pakistan. He stated that the U.S. has to request a general waiver at
                                Geneva because of the explicit provisions of Section 22, and at
                                present there is no possibility of getting this law repealed. Now
                                that the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is being revised, and
                                since the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> organization has to
                                be approved by the Congress, the U.S. has no choice but to ask
                                indulgence of our friends in this matter. The U.S. must have this
                                waiver if it is to succeed in getting approval by the Congress of
                                the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> organization being
                                negotiated at Geneva. The President has said that he would seek
                                Congressional approval of this organization.</p>
                            <p>He said that he does not believe U.S. actions will “bust the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> wide open” and lead to a trade
                                restriction spiral. On the contrary, we wish to avoid this. The
                                waiver we request would give us breathing time to correct our
                                present agricultural surplus problem.</p>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> referred to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCD1">Howe</persName>’s suggestion for
                            modifying <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XI to cover the
                            requirements of Section 22. He stated that the requirements of Section
                            22 are far broader than the exceptions allowed under Article XI. He
                            emphasized that the U.S. Executive Branch is not a free agent in this
                            matter because of existing law, and emphasized that the stakes in this
                            issue are much larger as the purposes of the Trade Extension Act will
                            fail if Congressional approval of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            fails. If we lose the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, we lose the
                            mechanism whereby we can engage in multilateral tariff negotiations. He
                            stated that the main point in the U.S. Congress is that <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> will not pass if there is any
                            suggestion that the Executive Branch is limiting or compromising
                            domestic law; i.e., no executive power nor international agreement can
                            contravene or override Section 22.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>A rather lengthy discussion ensued as the possibility of modifying
                            Article XI to embody Section 22. The general consensus was that a
                            broadening of Article XI to cover Section 22 was no better than a waiver
                            of the type being proposed by the U.S. and would create serious
                            additional problems in itself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"

                            of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> by the Congress was
                            necessary for an adequate effectuation of the Trade Extension Act. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> explained that the
                            issue of executive-legislative powers and the superiority of domestic
                            law would be injected into the debate on the Trade Extension Act unless
                            the U.S. obtained a waiver under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            that made it crystal-clear that there would be no conflict between the

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCD1">Howe</persName> suggested that one
                            means of solving the problem would be to put off Congressional action on
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> until next year. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> replied that this was
                            impossible as the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the Trade
                            Extension Act were both necessary and were supplementary to each other.
                            He stated that trading without <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            would be impracticable as this was the instrument of U.S. multilateral

                            corresp="#p_HCD1">Howe</persName> raised with you the question as to
                        whether actions taken by the United States under Section 22 are not already
                        justified under certain exceptions in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>,
                        and hence whether the United States really needs open-end waiver. On the
                        basis of subsequent discussions with Canadian officials in Washington, it
                        seems there was some misunderstanding on the part of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCD1">Howe</persName> on this subject.</p>
                    <p>We have always recognized that some actions we need to take under Section 22
                        are consistent with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Import fees
                        on products on which we have not undertaken to bind the import charges
                        against increase are in that category. Quotas on products on which we have
                        domestic restrictions on production or marketing are likewise permissible.
                        The difficulty is that the requirements of Section 22 necessitate the use of
                        quotas and fees in other cases as well, where their use is not consistent
                        with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Details as to which Section 22
                        situations are and which are not consistent with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> are in Tab A.</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0109"/>
                    <p>The waiver we seek is only intended to cover the cases in which the
                        requirements of Section 22 have necessitated or may necessitate imposition
                        of fees or quotas that are inconsistent with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <frus:attachment>
                        <head>Tab A</head>
                        <p>Section 22 requires that when the President finds that imports threaten
                            to interfere materially with farm programs or threaten to render such
                            programs ineffective he shall impose such fees or quotas (within
                            specified limits as to their restrictiveness) as will in his judgment
                            prevent the interference from imports. Some restrictions that the United
                            States must impose under these criteria are consistent with <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and some are not.</p>
                        <p>With regard to fees under Section 22, <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> prohibits such fees without exception when they are
                            applied to items on which the United States has granted a concession.
                            Consequently, without a waiver, fees we must impose constitute a
                            violation when they apply to concession items. Our fee on filberts is a
                            case in point.</p>
                        <p>Another part of the problem arises in the use of quotas. <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XI contains a general
                            prohibition against quantitative restrictions on imports except in
                            certain specified situations. We need a waiver to permit the use of
                            quotas under Section 22 to the extent that such quotas are inconsistent
                            with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. The few situations in which

                            may have had in mind, are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Quotas are permitted on imports of an agricultural product when necessary
                            to the enforcement of governmental measures to restrict the quantity of
                            the domestic products permitted to be marketed or produced. The United
                            States quota on cotton, wheat, and peanuts are justified under this
                            provision because production restrictions are in effect on these
                            products. (But quotas on many items are not justified because we have no
                            production or marketing restrictions on them.)</p>
                        <p>Article XI also permits import restrictions necessary to the removal of
                            temporary surpluses if the surpluses are being made available to certain
                            groups of domestic consumers free of charge or at prices below the
                            current market (note this excludes foreign giveaway). To qualify, such a
                            program must, however, provide an effective disposal of a temporary
                            surplus. We have no effective programs for the disposal of surplus
                            products in the United States within the terms of this provision. In
                            addition, it would be difficult to get others to agree that our
                            surpluses are temporary. They are the outgrowth of the incentive price
                            support programs and are likely to <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0110"
                            />continue indefinitely unless price supports are lowered or
                            restrictions are imposed on domestic production.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XX, II(c) permits import
                            restrictions essential to the liquidation of temporary surpluses arising
                            out of the exigencies of the war. It would be difficult to persuade
                            other countries that burdensome surpluses which developed eight years
                            after the end of hostilities are due to the exigencies of the war.</p>
                        <p>Our present Section 22 restrictions on dairy products, oats, rye, barley
                            and filberts are not permitted under any provision of <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. These restrictions, as well as
                            future actions which we may have to take on agricultural products, would
                            require a waiver under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss></p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName></hi>: We have had informal consultations with the
                        Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Danes, Italians, British and
                        Canadians with respect to our Section 22 waiver. It is difficult to describe
                        the atmosphere of those discussions.</p>
                    <p>We met last night in a climate of depression and concern. All of the
                        countries, even I believe the Canadians, though they did not say so,
                        recognize that we will have to get the waiver. Everyone not only feels, but
                        expressed, albeit in moderate and sympathetic terms, a sense of letdown,
                        discouragement, and disappointment that it was necessary for the U.S. to
                        take this position. When they were talking about possible changes in the
                        form of the waiver, they did not take a negotiating position, but rather
                        spoke in terms of appealing to us. Obviously, they will be stiffer in
                        working party and will insist in a number of changes, many of which I think
                        we can properly give them. But last night they were simply bowing to
                        superior strength.</p>
                    <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0111"/>
                    <p>The meeting began with a statement by one delegate that this was the most
                        disagreeable of a whole series of spoonfulls of bad medicine which his
                        country had had to absorb at this meeting and ended with a statement of
                        another that the U.S. had to get a two-thirds vote which meant that only ten
                        countries could vote against the waiver. The delegate asked how they should
                        decide which ones should have the privilege of doing so.</p>
                    <p>They were all terribly concerned about the effect of the waiver and its
                        open-ended character on the efforts we are all making to limit the use of
                        hard-core quotas<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">Contracting parties were
                            authorized under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XIV to
                            restrict imports from other members as long as these quotas were
                            necessary to correct balance-of-payments deficits. However, at the same
                            time these import quotas often shielded domestic industries which could
                            not compete with less expensive imports. Because the elimination of
                            these restrictions often had an adverse economic impact on the
                            industries involved, several contracting parties supported an amendment
                            to permit the maintenance of these so-called “hard core” quotas once the
                            payments problems which had legitimized them had disappeared.</note> by
                        European countries. They are finding it increasingly difficult, for example,
                        to see how they can insist on a time limit for the Europeans and none for
                        us.</p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, clear to me that the biggest contribution we could make to
                        success in dealing with the European hard-core problem in a manner which
                        would satisfy us (we must not forget that those quotas will be imposed
                        mostly on agricultural products and, for example, on coal) and to the
                        improvement of the general US position here, would be if we could accept a
                        time limit, even in the form suggested by DeFelice<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d19fn3"><persName>A. Richard DeFelice</persName>, adviser to the
                            U.S. Delegation from the Department of Agriculture.</note> in the draft
                        he sent back to Washington. It is too early yet to say whether this is
                        something that we will have to do to get the waiver, or how great the cost
                        of doing without it will be to us in dealing with the hard-core problem. I
                        therefore do not feel I can put the proposal forward as a matter of absolute
                        negotiating necessity.</p>
                    <p>I would, however, ask you to consider whether as a matter of general
                        contribution to our relations with all these countries, especially as a
                        matter of relations with Canada, and as a contribution to getting what we
                        want and what the smaller countries of Europe, who feel they are being let
                        down by the U.S., want in dealing with the hard-core problem, we might
                        indicate a willingness to take some form of a time limit. You will recall
                        that you thought of making this suggestion to <persName corresp="#p_WLD1"

                            facs="0112"/>use it as a possible negotiating counter here. I think the

                        make this offer, it would have a striking and very beneficial effect upon
                        the entire atmosphere of this conference and especially upon the outcome of
                        the hard-core problem and the U.S. negotiating position in a variety of
                        matters which are now coming to a head. Against this we must, of course,
                        weigh the political problem which such a time limit might create for us at
                        home. Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>Tagg 367. Section 22 application debated plenary today and sent to working
                        party. Level of debate high but somber in tone, reflecting sense of crisis
                        in affairs of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> as result action by its
                        leading member. Twenty delegations spoke. All except Brazil, which stated
                        would not accept waiver under any circumstances, appreciated considerations
                        connected with Congressional presentation which led to US request and
                        importance firm US participation new organization, but expressed most
                        serious concern at implications for their own trade with US and for future
                        of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Canada, New Zealand, Netherlands
                        pointed out possibly injury to their trade. Many speakers emphasized
                        difficulty for their governments in living up to their obligations if US got
                        exemptions from some of its major obligations. France, Sweden, Italy,
                        Austria and several others said US problem was no different instance from
                        hard-core European problem and both should be treated on same basis. <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> stated they would have to have facilities for
                        their problems roughly equivalent to those received by US.</p>
                    <p>France for obvious reasons urged that US waiver be decided first and then
                        applied to solution European hard-core problem.</p>
                    <p>Several countries emphasized inequity special treatment for US and additional
                        imbalance such waiver would create in agreement.</p>

                    <p>No discussion terms proposed waiver but many countries urged that it be
                        limited to existing restrictions and contain time limit.</p>
                    <p>Only countries indicating clear support for waiver were France and
                        Greece.</p>
                    <p>Discussion in steering group after plenary clearly indicated group felt US
                        application had substantially diminished chances placing significant

                        was to determine what authority should be given to the Delegation in Geneva
                        for signing the documents that would result from the work of the Ninth
                        Session. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to
                        indicate the status of the main problems of the Session.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that the Session was
                        still faced with several outstanding issues on which decisions would have to
                        be reached. After the decisions had been made on these issues the Session
                        would be speedily terminated. These issues were: <list>

                    <p>It was the Delegation’s impression that the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> that would emerge from the negotiations would be a
                        substantially better one. The emphasis of certain Articles, particularly
                        those dealing with the conditions under which import restrictions could be
                        imposed, had been shifted in the direction of the United States point of
                        view, and an improvement in the enforcement machinery of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Articles was practically certain. The
                        United States position on subsidies would be pretty largely reflected in the
                        new Article XVI, except for one point to which he would refer later. The

                            xml:id="d21fn5">The U.S. position was that the <gloss target="#t_OTC1"

                            international issues. (See <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.)</note>
                        had been largely attained. The Delegation had been successful in preventing
                        the inclusion of articles in the new <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        on restrictive business practices and full employment. The provisions
                        dealing with underdeveloped countries (Article XVIII) had been simplified
                        and the procedures in that Article and those in the balance of payments
                        provisions had been made less complex. In sum, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated, the United States will have
                        in the new General Agreement a proposed Organization capable of improving
                        the present enforcement and application of <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> Articles, a simpler Agreement in certain major fields, and
                        a certainty that its desire to place the General Agreement on a permanent
                        basis is shared by all of the Contracting Parties. He wished to point out
                        that the new <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would differ very
                        markedly from the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter<note n="6"

                    <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0115"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated at this point that
                        a brief should be prepared which would spell out the benefits to the United
                        States of the General Agreement. He felt that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>’s point regarding the dissimilarity
                        between the General Agreement and the <gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>
                        Charter would be one of the most important points in the brief. He asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to distinguish for the
                        members of the group the difference between the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> Organization Agreement and the General Agreement on
                        Tariffs and Trade itself.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> replied that the
                        Organization Agreement would be the basic charter of the new Organization
                        that would be responsible for the administration of the General Agreement.
                        It would contain provisions on membership, functions, subsidiary bodies,
                        procedures and the standard provisions usually found in international
                        instruments of this type. It was the Organization Agreement which the
                        Administration was committed to submit to the Congress for its approval.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> went on,
                        the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was a multilateral trade
                        agreement containing many of the rules of trade which the United States had
                        formerly incorporated in all of its bilateral trade agreements. He estimated
                        that approximately 85 percent of the General Agreement, as amended at the
                        Ninth Session, reflected United States experience in bilateral trade
                        agreements. The important point was that this experience was embodied in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in general provisions applicable
                        to all of the trade of the Contracting Parties, whether covered by
                        concessions or not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGD1">Morgan</persName> asked what the powers of
                        the new Organization would be—he wondered, specifically, whether the
                        Organization would have supranational powers. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that the proposed Organization
                        would have no sanctions but that it would have two very important functions:
                        (a) it would be able to mobilize international opinion against countries
                        violating the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and (b) it would be able
                        to release a country adhering to the Agreement from its obligations to
                        another country adhering to the Agreement if the latter was in violation of
                        its commitments. However the Organization could not make any country accept
                        an amendment to the General Agreement against its will.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked Mr.

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked whether the
                        declaration on Article XXVIII would involve an infringement on the
                        prerogative of the Congress. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                            >Brown</persName> replied in the negative. He explained that the United
                        States was always free to withdraw a tariff concession that it had granted.
                        In such an event, however, the country from which the concession had been
                        withdrawn would have the right to retaliate by withdrawing a compensatory
                        concession.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> stated that the Chairman of
                        the Tariff Commission had spoken to him frequently on this matter during the
                        past week, recommending against US adherence to the proposed declaration on
                        the ground that it would encounter Congressional opposition. The Chairman of
                        the Commission had also maintained that other countries would be able to
                        withdraw concessions from the United States, notwithstanding their adherence
                        to the declaration, whereas the United States could not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that other countries
                        regarded their adherence to the declaration on the continued stability of
                        the tariff concessions as a very serious matter. Many of them were initially
                        opposed to such a declaration, and had only changed their views with the
                        greatest reluctance. He felt certain that they would adhere to the
                        declaration fully. He wished to point out that the US would still have
                        access to the escape clause article of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> (Article XIX) even if it adhered to the declaration on
                        Article XXVIII.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked specifically what
                        the benefits would be to the US in agreeing not to withdraw or modify any of
                        the concessions it had granted for a stipulated period of time except in
                        special circumstances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>
                        stated that adherence to such a declaration would assure US exporters
                        against increases in duties which are now bound. In his view, retaliation by
                        the US or other countries against such increases, through the withdrawal of
                        compensatory concessions, was not an advantage to any contracting party
                        since such actions only reduce international trade rather than expand
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Frank</persName> pointed out that the inter-agency Trade
                        Agreements Committee had reviewed the problem of a continued binding of the
                        tariff concessions. The issue, essentially, was whether the United <pb
                            n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0117"/>States could go along with the
                        general principle of extending the existing tariff concessions for a fixed
                        period of time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked what the effect on
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would be if Congress were to
                        approve the Organization Agreement with a rider providing that the United
                        States should not sign any declaration continuing the firm life of the
                        tariff concessions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated
                        that the effect of such action would be to weaken the effectiveness of both
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Organization and of the General
                        Agreement itself.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of whether full powers should be accorded the United
                        States Delegation to sign the amended <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that the issues
                        with respect to Section 22 were whether the United States Delegation could
                        agree to an <hi rend="italic">annual review</hi> by the Contracting Parties,
                        based on the United States report to them, of its actions taken under a
                        Section 22 waiver, and whether <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0118"/>it
                        could agree to having the waiver granted for a <hi rend="italic">stipulated
                            period of time</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that the Delegation
                        believed that an annual review by the Contracting Parties of U.S. action
                        under the Section 22 waiver would be advantageous to the United States.
                        Under such procedure the examination in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> of Section 22 actions would take place in a more or less
                        routine manner. In the Delegation’s view it would be far better to have U.S.
                        Section 22 actions appear as a regular feature of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> agenda rather than in an atmosphere of
                        challenge by a contracting party under Article XXIII. Moreover, if the
                        United States agreed to an annual review of its actions based on a U.S.
                        report, it might be possible to secure an annual review of the restrictions
                        which certain countries desire to maintain to protect their industries after
                        the balance of payments justifications for such restrictions had disappeared
                        (“hard core” restrictions). Finally, there was considerable pressure among
                        other Contracting Parties for including an annual review in the Section 22
                        waiver which it would be difficult to resist.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> pointed out that an annual
                        review would afford the United States an opportunity to explain the basis
                        for its agricultural policy. He asked for the opinion of the Department of
                        Agriculture on this matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Rossiter</persName> of the Department of Agriculture stated
                        that his agency had no objection to an annual review of Section 22 actions
                        by the Contracting Parties, based on a U.S. report submitted to them,
                        provided that other Contracting Parties agreed to subject to an annual
                        review the restrictions that they desire to maintain to protect certain of
                        their industries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGD1">Morgan</persName> asked
                        whether the acceptance by the United States of an annual review requirement
                        might raise at each session the question of whether Section 22 should be
                        continued. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> replied in the
                        negative but stated that this question did arise in connection with whether
                        the United States could agree to a waiver having a stipulated duration.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> asked whether the annual
                        review of Section 22 actions might lead to resolution of censure by the
                        Contracting Parties against the United States at some future session. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that this was
                        unlikely unless the U.S. were to use Section 22 on a very extensive basis.
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> suggested that it would be
                        desirable to indicate publicly, when the necessity arose for doing so, that
                        the U.S. obligation under the waiver would be to report to the Contracting
                        Parties, with the Organization reviewing its report. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that this was exactly the
                        description of what the term “annual review” meant.</p>
                    <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0119"/>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Decision: Section 22 Annual Review</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that if there were
                        no dissent, the Delegation would be authorized to agree to the inclusion in
                        Section 22 of a requirement for an annual report by the U.S. to the
                        Contracting Parties on actions taken under the waiver, which report would
                        then be reviewed by the Contracting Parties. There was no dissent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that the next issue
                        was whether the U.S. could agree to a waiver which would be valid only for a
                        stipulated period of time. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                            >Brown</persName> to describe the elements of this problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that he believed the
                        Delegation would be able to secure a Section 22 waiver without agreeing to a
                        limitation on the waiver with respect to time. On the other hand, if the
                        waiver were granted for a specified period of time, there would be a strong
                        implication that it could not be revoked before the expiration of that time
                        limit. The main issue here was the presentation problem, i.e., whether it
                        could be made clear to the Congress that no matter which waiver was granted,
                        the United States would still be able to use Section 22 without any limit on
                        its actions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked whether a waiver
                        having a duration of five years could be satisfactory from the U.S. point of
                        view. He noted that the United States would want a shorter period of time on
                        the restrictions which other countries would want to impose for protective
                        purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that any waiver should have a clear indication as to its duration.
                        Otherwise, the Section 22 problem would be on the agenda of every meeting of
                        the Contracting Parties, with the possibility of the question being raised
                        of whether the waiver should be continued.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> suggested that a waiver
                        granted for a stipulated period of time might lead the Congress to believe
                        mistakenly that the Administration at the end of that period intended to get
                        rid of Section 22. However, from what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                            >Brown</persName> had said, it appeared that there was some negotiating
                        advantage to be gained by agreeing to a waiver having a fixed duration. He
                        asked for the views of the members of the group.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGD1">Morgan</persName> stated that for
                        presentational reasons he was opposed to a Section 22 waiver of stipulated
                        duration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLU1">Stambaugh</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that the waiver should be limited in time, with the understanding
                        that the United States would not discuss the question of renewal of the
                        waiver or its continuance during that period of time, which would be, say,
                        five years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">Morse</persName> stated that for
                        presentational reasons the Department of Agriculture was not in favor of a
                        waiver that would not contain any stipulation as to <pb n="90"
                            xml:id="pg_90" facs="0120"/>its duration. Mr.
                            <persName>Chalmers</persName> stated that the Department of Commerce
                        favored a waiver having a stipulated duration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> for State indicated that it
                        would be easier to present to the Congress a waiver having no stipulation as
                        to time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> stated that he
                        was in favor of a waiver having a stipulated period of time. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> indicated that the Delegation would
                        probably be able to secure a waiver of unstipulated duration but that this
                        would affect the negotiations on the restrictions which other countries
                        desire to impose for protective purposes after the balance of payments
                        justification for those restrictions will have disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> requested the members of
                        the group to consider the problem further in view of the absence of any
                        clear consensus of opinion and to be prepared to express a definite position
                        on the matter the next day.<note n="6" xml:id="d22fn6">In the meeting held
                            on February 16, <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName>
                            stated after some discussion that it appeared that there was a slight
                            majority in favor of seeking a waiver of unlimited duration, and he
                            authorized the delegation to seek such a waiver. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWG1">Winthrop Brown</persName> asked whether the
                            delegation might agree to a waiver for a stipulated period if the United
                            States appeared to gain some clear advantage from such an agreement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> assented but pointed
                            out that the basic problem would be to convince Congress that a waiver

                            action in enforcing Section 22. (Minutes of <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"

                        of the group on “full powers”, i.e., that all documents resulting from the
                        Session were to be signed by the Delegation in Geneva (the Organization
                        Agreement, ad referendum) after the documents had been examined and checked
                        at the policy level in Washington.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that we understood that
                        The Netherlands Government intended to vote against our request for a waiver
                        under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> for our Section 22 actions,
                        but that we were in a position where we might need their vote to get the
                        two-thirds majority. He said that we, ourselves, did not like to request a
                        waiver for Section 22 but that we had to in order to get Congressional
                        acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> organization
                        agreement. Without it, there might be no <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> and we would have to go back to the old bilateral system
                        of trade agreements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> reviewed the history of our
                        use of Section 22, pointing out that we had used it in moderation.
                        Furthermore, he said, we were willing to agree to prior consultation; to an
                        annual report regarding actions we take under Section 22; and to a review of
                        the report by the Contracting Parties. He said that even with the waiver, we
                        will have a difficult task getting the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        organization agreement through Congress. Therefore, every vote that we lose
                        will give the enemies of the program ammunition. He said that the United
                        States would appreciate the vote of The Netherlands even though we know that
                        they do not favor such a waiver. We recognize that they would be voting on
                        the basis of choosing the lesser of two evils.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he would pass this information on to his Government;
                        that they, here at the Embassy, understood our problem and were sympathetic
                        with it, but that their Government had its problems also. His Government is
                        afraid of a precedent which might be followed by other countries, such as
                        Germany and France, who are not too enthusiastic about getting rid of quota
                            <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0122"/>restrictions, and who would
                        support the waiver in order to be able to use similar devices. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that he had heard that argument
                        before, particularly from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCD1">C.D.
                            Howe</persName> of Canada, but that we were faced with the fact that we
                        had a law on the books that requires our taking Section 22 action under
                        certain conditions and that this law had to be complied with by the
                        President. He felt that it would be better to have a <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> agreement approved by Congress with a
                        Section 22 waiver in it than to have no <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> at all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> expressed the opinion that
                        the Republican Party had made a tremendous swing, in support of the
                        President, from a high protectionist policy to a pretty liberal trade
                        policy, but in order to have a better trade policy, we have to make some
                        concessions which we don’t like. We recognize that this is not an ideal
                        arrangement but that it is better than no <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador agreed that it would be better for the future of international
                        trade to have the United States in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        than to rely on a bilateral type of approach. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that he felt that if the new
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> were approved by Congress, it
                        would be a great step forward by a Republican Administration, and emphasized
                        that we do not want to go back to the bilateral type of trade policy. The
                        Ambassador said that he felt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName>’s points were well taken and that he would pass them
                        on to his Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Speekenbrink</persName> asked if the vote were badly needed.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that he didn’t know
                        what the most recent count was but that the vote might be close. Mr.
                            <persName>Speekenbrink</persName> said that if it were badly needed,
                        they might be able to vote for the waiver, but they would prefer to vote
                        against it in order to strengthen their hand against the efforts of
                        countries like Germany and France who would like to continue the use of
                        quotas. The Ambassador added that if they voted against it, and we still got
                        the two-thirds majority, they would be in a stronger position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that their negative
                        vote would make it more difficult for the United States, whereupon Mr.
                            <persName>Speekenbrink</persName> asked why we need a 100 per cent vote
                        for the waiver. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> pointed out
                        that the opponents of the program would not relate a negative vote to
                        Section 22 but would connect it with the whole United States program, and
                        would try to make the point that in spite of United States efforts in
                        foreign economic relations, other countries were being uncooperative. He
                        said that he, of course, would not expect them to vote for the waiver
                        without making a statement in which they made clear their opposition in
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>In answer to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>
                        said that Canada apparently intended to vote against the waiver but that
                        Australia had given no indication yet that they would vote against it.</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0123"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Speekenbrink</persName> remarked that in Holland the Section 22
                        waiver would be regarded as one part of the total picture of United States
                        foreign trade policy. He mentioned the restrictions on butter and other
                        products and the talk about restricting residual fuel oil. He said that all
                        of this made up a whole picture for their people. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> agreed that it must be considered as
                        a whole but said that he believed the Republican Party which had been
                        traditionally protectionist was making progress throughout the United States
                        in shifting to a more liberal trade policy. Of course, there were exceptions
                        but support was being given by groups like the Detroit Chamber of Commerce,
                        the American Federation of Labor, various women’s leagues, etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Speekenbrink</persName> suggested that they might vote for the
                        waiver and then find that H. R. 1 was passed for only one year with no
                        tariff negotiations in the offing. Then they would feel that they had sold
                        themselves cheap. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that
                        he felt that the President had enough strength and support to get H. R. 1 in
                        substantially its present form.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he would be glad to present our view to his
                        Government but that he could not guarantee anything. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> assured him that we did not expect
                        him to make a commitment but would appreciate his emphasizing to his
                        Government the importance of this waiver to the United States.<note n="2"

                        comments on some of the more important individuals in the Session.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General Impressions</hi></p>
                    <p>The consensus of opinion of delegates who have participated in previous
                        sessions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and in its negotiation
                        in 1947 was that this session involved a far more difficult negotiation than
                        any previous session. The reason for this is apparent, namely, that the
                        delegates at this review session were dealing far more with actual realities
                        than they were in 1947. At that time most of the commitments taken by the
                        non-dollar countries were blurred by the ever-present opportunity for
                        recourse to quotas for balance-of-payments reasons. Under the comfortable
                        shelter of this admittedly essential protection, many provisions of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and many commitments involved in
                        it seemed less real than they do today. Thus most countries were reluctant
                        to take on new obligations because they realized that their acceptance of
                        those obligations involved them in more definite and real commitments than
                        had been the case before. Many even wished to re-examine existing
                        commitments, which, because of the improvement in the general world
                        situation, were beginning to take force and bite where they had not had
                        practical effect before.</p>
                    <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0125"/>
                    <p>Moreover, when the General Agreement was first negotiated it was done in the
                        anticipation that the Havana Charter<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">See <ref
                                target="#d21fn6">footnote 6, Document 21</ref>.</note> would come
                        into effect. In the case of a good number of countries, particularly the
                        underdeveloped countries, the Charter would have given certain escapes which
                        are not present in the General Agreement and which during the present Review
                        Session failed of inclusion in the General Agreement.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that this Session did not result in any very
                        great changes in the General Agreement. This is the more understandable
                        because the Review of the Agreement revealed that in fact it was a far
                        tighter and better Agreement than had perhaps been realized before. The
                        rules against use of quotas for protective reasons, the obligation to
                        maintain tariffs at the rates bound in the schedules, the obligation not to
                        discriminate or obstruct imports through non-tariff and non-quota measures,
                        have been in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> since the beginning.
                        But their significance has been to a large extent submerged because of the
                        extent of balance-of-payments restrictions. With the improvement referred to
                        above in the world situation, these obligations stood out in the minds of
                        the delegates as real commitments. True, they had not been applied in the
                        past. But they were there as legal obligations. Actually, the rules against
                        the use of quotas and the rules against discrimination needed little
                        strengthening. What they needed was better enforcement. In this respect the
                        Agreement was improved.</p>
                    <p>Another factor which stood out clearly was the inherent limitation on the
                        capacity to effect major changes in countries’ internal policies by
                        international agreement. In case after case where a really important
                        national interest was involved the country concerned simply refused to take
                        a commitment to change its national policy. Countries were willing to accept
                        limitations on their freedom to act in many ways. They were willing to
                        accept commitments to maintain the status quo. But on big issues they were
                        not yet ready to bind themselves to make major changes in national policy,
                        even to get others to accept the same obligations.</p>
                    <p>This was particularly clear in the case of United States with respect to
                        Section 22, American selling price, etc., France in connection with export
                        subsidies, Germany with respect to the need to protect the hardcore of its
                        agricultural production, the underdeveloped countries with respect to their
                        programs of economic development, and so forth.</p>
                    <p>The problem, therefore, was how to work out rules which met the majority of
                        the cases on a sound basis and provided leeway <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96"
                            facs="0126"/>where they ran into some really immovable national
                        interest. This is the reason for the waivers granted at the Session.</p>
                    <p>It was felt that it was healthier not to change basic rules which were
                        considered to be right simply to meet a few major individual difficulties.
                        It was rather thought preferable to deal with these by specific
                        dispensations, tailored so far as possible to meet the particular case, and
                        carrying as strict conditions as the country involved was able to
                        accept.</p>
                    <p>The approach of delegates to the Review revealed two basic schools of
                        thought. The first was that of the large majority which believed that the
                        Contracting Parties should be expanded into a very broadly-based permanent
                        trade organization comparable to the proposed <gloss target="#t_ITO1"
                            >ITO</gloss>. The other, in which the United States was the leader, and
                        which was very much smaller, believed that the new organization should be
                        primarily confined to administration of the General Agreement and closely
                        related matters. A large part of the time of the Conference was taken up in
                        discussing and defeating efforts to expand the scope of the new Organization
                        into the fields of commodities, cartels, investment, full employment,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>In this and other senses a great deal of the achievement of this Conference
                        lay in what was not done.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">US Negotiating Position</hi></p>
                    <p>The US negotiating position in the meeting was handicapped and the US
                        influence considerably diminished, by three main facts. The first was the
                        necessity to ask for a blanket waiver to cover all actions that the United
                        States might in the future wish to take under Section 22 of the Agricultural
                        Adjustment Act.</p>
                    <p>The second was the fact that we had to oppose so many substantive things
                        desired by other countries, and that in that opposition there was
                        practically no flexibility in our position. We were, for example, unable to
                        accept any commitment with respect to consultation on disposal of surpluses
                        or liquidation of strategic stocks. We were the only country that was
                        unwilling to do anything in the field of commodity agreements. What we were
                        able to accept with respect to subsidies was limited as compared to what
                        others felt was reasonable. We had to insist on retaining the right to
                        subsidize even when no domestic price support arrangements were involved and
                        no arbitrary restrictions were being imposed against us; in other words,
                        when all that was involved was free competition. We were unable even to take
                        a commitment to give notice to countries that were interested in our
                        liquidation of surplus stocks through diplomatic channels when we had given
                        formal public notice.</p>
                    <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0127"/>
                    <p>The third was the continued insistence of the United States on taking
                        positions for presentational reasons at home which seemed unreasonable or
                        unnecessary to other countries, while at the same time opposing the
                        inclusion, or insisting on exclusion, of provisions in the Agreement which
                        other countries felt were necessary for their own presentational reasons. It
                        was true in this Conference, as has been in the case in others attended by
                        the writer, that the United States, more than any other country, tends to
                        insist on presentational points in matters of detail in a manner which
                        creates great difficulties in negotiation. This is perhaps due in part to
                        the compartmentalization of thinking in the United States Government,
                        perhaps inherent in its size, but it is a handicap which could to a
                        considerable extent be avoided, and which it would be very helpful to avoid,
                        in future negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the United States asked for a waiver for Section 22
                        overshadowed the whole Conference on every major issue in which we attempted
                        to seek strengthening of the rules or of their enforcement, or to ask other
                        countries to accept obligations to give more access to our goods, or to
                        lessen discrimination against them. We were met with the simple question,
                        “You are not willing to accept any obligation with respect to imports of
                        agricultural products which might perhaps someday come under one of your
                        agricultural programs. Why should we?” Or put more simply, “You tell us that
                        you have a real problem because of the existence of your agricultural
                        programs and Section 22. We believe you and we will reluctantly accommodate
                        you, but we have a problem too and we must expect you to accommodate us”.
                        That the final result contains as satisfactory rules from the point of view
                        of the United States as it does (for example, that the so-called hard-core
                        waiver is as tight as it is),<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">The “hard core”
                            waiver, approved March 5, allowed contracting parties a maximum 5-year
                            period during which a quota could be maintained after the balance of
                            payments difficulties which had originally justified it had passed. For

                        countries attach to the presence of the United States in the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. But this position did not enhance our
                        prestige in that Organization.</p>
                    <p>The net result of all of this was to create an impression that the United
                        States was always insisting on having its own way. This strengthened the
                        feeling of a large and important bloc of countries that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is an unbalanced and inequitable
                        agreement largely tailored to accommodate the needs of the US.</p>
                    <p>US insistence on retaining the right to subsidize, and particularly refusal
                        to accept the equitable share test as applied to individual markets rather
                        than world markets, gave rise to many caustic comments <pb n="98"
                            xml:id="pg_98" facs="0128"/>about the US as the great exponent of free
                        competition being unwilling to accept the fact that a country might win a
                        market by straight competition. Moreover, it was exceedingly difficult to
                        preach the virtues of competition to the underdeveloped countries and argue
                        against protection of manufactured goods and agriculture in Europe against
                        the background of our double-barreled insistence on the right to use Section
                        22 to protect our agriculture and the right to continue the use of export
                        subsidies for our agriculture even in cases where there was no price support
                        and no artificial barriers against our exports.</p>

                            found in Department of State files.</note> gives a résumé of the
                        important factors and attitudes involved in the negotiations on each of the
                        major issues of the Conference.</p>
                    <p>One of the significant developments which could not be much publicized was
                        the complaint made by the Danes against the export price activities of the
                        Coal and Steel Community. In the course of the review of the Coal and Steel
                        Community’s report, the Dane<note n="7" xml:id="d24fn7">Reference is
                            unclear.</note> made it plain that he considered export prices of the
                        Community members to be inequitable and that Denmark was having to pay much
                        higher prices for steel from the Community than other recipients of the
                        Community’s steel. The Community resisted the complaint, but finally, under
                        pressure, provided the Danes with a great many facts and figures which it
                        had theretofore consistently refused to give him. An examination of these
                        facts and figures looked on their face as though the Dane had spoken too
                        soon in making his claim. He, therefore, agreed to withdraw the complaint
                        from the Ninth Session agenda but reserved his right to revert to it at a
                        later session pending study of the figures and finding out whether the
                        figures were complete and accurate. The Coal and Steel Community sent four
                        representatives down to listen to this withdrawal, which took about 30
                        seconds, and also sent along a press officer who, according to reliable
                        correspondents, tried to give the impression that the Dane had fully
                        abandoned his complaint and that he had been proved to have been entirely
                        wrong, an interpretation not supported even by the reading of the actual
                        press announcement.</p>
                    <p>This development further reflects the inordinate sensitivity of the Community
                        throughout all examination of its report to any kind of criticism, or in
                        some cases even to questioning, particularly on anything having to do with
                        the cartel issue. It also boomeranged on the Community because the Dane
                        protested the Community’s revelation <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0129"
                        />of action taken at private sessions of the Contracting Parties and their
                        biased representations to the press. In this he was unanimously upheld by
                        the <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>s. A press denial was issued, and a
                        formal protest sent by the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_CP1"
                        >CP</gloss>s to the High Authority.</p>
                    <p>The granting of our waiver for Section 22,<note n="8" xml:id="d24fn8">The
                            U.S. waiver was accepted by the necessary two-thirds majority on March 5
                            by a vote of 23–5 with 5 abstentions. Canada, Cuba, Denmark, the
                            Netherlands, and New Zealand voted against the waiver; Brazil, Burma,
                            Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, and South Africa abstained.</note> of course,
                        left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth because of its extremely broad terms
                        and the precedent which everyone feared it would establish. A great many of
                        the delegates felt somewhat less badly about the matter, however, because
                        they did expect the United States to continue to be moderate in the use of
                        Section 22. Much of the harm done by this waiver can be avoided and its
                        effectiveness as a precedent for others can be greatly diminished if we
                        continue this policy of moderation. If in practice it turns out, as it has
                        in so many cases in the past, that the use of the Section really is limited
                        to cutting off excessive and abnormal imports and that what might reasonably
                        be considered to be a fair and normal share of the trade continues to be
                        allowed to enter, we will in the future be in the position to argue much
                        more effectively against unreasonable requests by others. Our legal position
                        may not be much better, but our moral and negotiating position will be
                        infinitely better. Such behavior will also protect us against the
                        possibility of the waiver being withdrawn.</p>

                    <p>One of the difficulties faced by the delegates was the fact that this
                        Conference was not strongly led. The British Delegation started out
                        vigorously as the leader of the group wishing to strengthen the
                        balance-of-payments provisions. For a variety of reasons it was not able to
                        maintain real leadership throughout the Conference. Many of the proposals it
                        made, for example, the two-year time limit for balance-of-payments
                        restrictions, were unrealistic and obviously foredoomed to failure. They
                        were also opposed by a large portion of the Commonwealth. The British
                        Delegation was not of the high calibre of its delegation in 1947; the acting
                        leader, Edgar Cohen, of the Board of Trade, being sporadically brilliant,
                        but not a personality calculated to be effective in a prolonged negotiation
                        with a wide variety of countries.</p>
                    <p>The British Delegation was particularly weak, for example, in contacts with
                        Latin America. They made little apparent effort to cultivate the Latin
                        Americans and to dissipate the deep suspicion with which the Latin American
                        delegates as a group regard anything <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0130"
                        />British. They frequently, for example, made the mistake of approaching
                        Latin Americans through an Indian or a Pakistani. Nothing could have been
                        better served to annoy the Latins, or to make them feel that their
                        suspicions that Britain dominates the Commonwealth were correct.</p>
                    <p>The United States was not able to exercise the same leadership as it had in
                        the past because its general prestige and moral standing in the meeting was
                        so diminished by its request for the Section 22 waiver, the other factors
                        described above and its unwillingness to accept any commitments with respect
                        to inconsistent existing legislation.</p>
                    <p>The entire performance of the French Delegation was deplorable. Throughout
                        the meeting they did their very best to disrupt and sabotage the efforts of
                        those who wished to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.
                        They bid openly and in an almost humiliating manner for the support of the
                        underdeveloped countries on anything that would weaken the provisions of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In so doing, according to one of
                        their principal representatives, they were reflecting a philosophy of the
                        French Government against any international commitments in the economic
                        field. Thus anything that could make the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> weaker was desirable from their point of view. They would
                        not, however, for prestige reasons leave the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Latin Americans were their usual difficult selves, Brazil being
                        particularly irresponsible. The only time during which the Brazilian
                        Delegation was in the least reasonable was during the brief period after Mr.

                        Geneva as leader of the Delegation, and at the very end. Efforts by the
                        United States Delegation to establish direct and friendly contacts with the
                        Brazilian Delegation were not successful until Mr.

                        prevailed.</p>

                        frequently gets fuzzy ideas in his mind and clings to them with the tenacity
                        of a bulldog. Lack of clarity of thinking by the Cuban Delegation, an
                        unwillingness to compromise on small points even <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101"
                            facs="0131"/>when substantial concessions were made to the Cuban
                        viewpoint, and obsession with particular problems (such as possible loss of
                        advantage to the Dominican Republic in sugar), often made it most difficult
                        to deal with the Cubans and at times seriously complicated and protracted
                        the negotiations. There were, however, uniformly, cordial and friendly
                        relations between the Cuban and US Delegations.</p>
                    <p>The Asian Delegations, with the exception of Ceylon and Indonesia, were on
                        the whole extremely constructive and reasonable. Ceylon was somewhat
                        difficult on commodity problems but otherwise cooperative.</p>
                    <p>The Turkish Delegation was uniformly friendly to the United States and

                        with his usual skill. He is, however, getting on in years and was
                        handicapped by the fact that he carries heavy responsibilities for Canada in

                    <p>The two outstanding personalities in the meeting were Jha<note n="13"
                            xml:id="d24fn13">L.K. Jha, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of

                        intelligent, instructive, cooperative and clear-thinking. He was wise in
                        judgment, eloquent in debate, reasonable in approach and extremely well
                        informed. More than any other Asian with whom the Delegation has had to
                        deal, Jha thought like a Westerner. He also had the courage to take a
                        Western position when he believed in it and support it with other
                        underdeveloped countries who disagreed… .</p>
                    <p>Crawford of Australia was extremely cooperative and helpful. He also is
                        highly intelligent, very clear-thinking, firm, humorous and well informed.
                        He also has a great capacity for not wasting time and sticking to the point.
                        The Delegation found him exceedingly satisfactory to deal with and it was
                        possible at all times to be completely frank with him. On many occasions his
                        subordinates tried to bargain too hard, but it was always possible by
                        discussion with Crawford to come out with a reasonable and mutually
                        satisfactory solution. He also would make a good chairman of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>s.</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0132"/>
                    <p>In this connection one should also mention Westerman,<note n="15"
                            xml:id="d24fn15">W.A. Westerman, Assistant Secretary of the Australian
                            Department of Commerce and Agriculture.</note> who was in charge of the
                        Australian Delegation for some time. He was most cooperative and competent.
                        In fact, throughout the whole meeting, even despite initial very strong
                        differences of opinion on balance-of-payments problems, subsidies, surplus
                        disposal, scarce currency and the Section 22 waiver, it was always possible
                        to work out a satisfactory agreement with the Australians. Moreover,
                        Crawford was willing to take responsibility for a compromise, to put it
                        forward himself and to defend it in Working Party and plenary. The best
                        example of this was the help he gave in connection with our waiver and in
                        connection with scarce currency.</p>
                    <p>One potentially very important development of the Conference was the failure
                        of an effort to establish a real working relationship between the staff of
                        the Fund<note n="16" xml:id="d24fn16">International Monetary Fund.</note>
                        and the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> secretariat. While the writer
                        would agree that certain members of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> secretariat had been rather irritating and that they did
                        not start the discussions in a very intelligent or tactful manner, the final
                        impression left with them and with members of the United Kingdom and other
                        delegations is that the Fund staff simply did not want, or were unable to
                        give, real cooperation. Rightly or wrongly, they gave the impression of
                        being either unable or unwilling to discuss anything on an informal basis
                        and to feel that every kind of discussion, even of small details, had to be
                        done on a basis of the Executive Directors of the Fund speaking to the
                            <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>s as a whole. This result, of course,
                        plays completely into the hands of delegations here which would like to see
                        the influence of the Fund weakened in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        matters. While the final report that came out is a generally satisfactory
                        document, and looks all right on the surface, the writer believes that this
                        problem is still basically unsolved.</p>
                    <p>No commentary on people would be complete without mentioning the Executive
                        Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_WEW1">Wyndham White</persName>. His
                        ingenuity and skill in finding acceptable compromises and suggesting
                        negotiating techniques was invaluable throughout the Conference. On many
                        occasions (for example, scarce currency, full employment, Article XXVIII,
                        reservation for existing legislation, organizational aspects), his
                        suggestions to a large extent helped bail the United States out of difficult
                        positions it was trying to hold. He, more than any other single person, was
                        responsible for the fact that any agreement was <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"
                            facs="0133"/>reached on one of the most difficult problems before the
                        Conference, Article XXVIII. He proved again to be one of the best friends
                        the US has in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and to be a key, if
                        not the principal, figure making this enterprise work despite serious
                        handicaps.</p>
                    <p>The office of the Executive Secretariat is also a very useful sounding board
                        through which to sense the feelings of other delegations on important
                        issues.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Future</hi></p>
                    <p>The writer believes that the General Agreement as it emerged from the review
                        is a better agreement, and that the organization agreement is wholly
                        satisfactory from the US point of view.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> has become for many countries even
                        more the symbol of our cooperation in the field of trade than the Trade
                        Agreements Act. And it is the fact that the Organization for Trade
                        Cooperation will never be born if the US does not join it. The writer doubts
                        if the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> could survive our rejection of
                        the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>, and the blow which our rejection
                        would give to our political and economic relationships with other countries
                        would be heavy indeed.</p>
                    <p>But assuming our participation, the establishment of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> would be only a first step. We will have to
                        make it work. This means providing it with qualified people. We must have a
                        really first-class representative on the Executive Committee and he must be
                        adequately staffed and backstopped in Washington. Moreover, our greatest
                        check on abuse of balance-of-payments restrictions by other countries to the
                        detriment of our exports is through the consultations required by the new
                        rules. These will be complicated and will require work and study, and
                        qualified men to do that work for us. If we and others do not staff this
                        enterprise properly it will fail.</p>

                    <p>After some opening remarks regarding the status of H.R. 1 in the Senate Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that the purpose
                        of the meeting was to examine the various documents resulting from the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Session with a view to having Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> sign them on behalf of the
                        United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> then asked
                        for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>’s comments on the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Review.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that the Delegation
                        was of the opinion that the United States had secured substantially all that
                        it had been instructed to obtain during the review of the Agreement. The
                        Delegation had been successful in keeping out of the Organization Agreement
                        provisions dealing with restrictive business practices, <pb n="106"
                            xml:id="pg_106" facs="0136"/>international investment, and many other
                        fields of international trade policy not related to tariffs. The proposals
                        of other countries for the inclusion of certain chapters of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss> Charter had been decisively rejected. The
                        organizational provisions of the present General Agreement had been
                        extracted from it and incorporated into a new Organization Agreement. The
                        stability of the tariff concessions had been assured by their extension to
                        the end of 1957 with a provision for their automatic extension for another
                        three years after that time. In connection with this last point it had been
                        necessary, however, to agree to a rather complicated renegotiation procedure
                        to apply during the period of the firm life of the concessions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> went on to note that the
                        fair share concept relative to the export of agricultural subsidies had been
                        written into the new Article XVI.<note n="11" xml:id="d26fn11">The amended
                            article stated that an export subsidy which is authorized by the
                            contracting parties should not result in the beneficiary country gaining
                            more than “an equitable share” of the export market based on its
                            previous exports of the subsidized product.</note> Moreover, the United
                        States had secured a waiver in connection with restrictions required under
                        Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended. This waiver would
                        leave the United States complete freedom of action with regard to the
                        imposition of such restrictions and has no stipulation as to time. Its
                        provisions for notices to countries affected by a proposed restriction and
                        for consultations with them are consistent with United States practice. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> expressed the view that the
                        United States obtained the waiver because other Delegations were convinced
                        that it was necessary to secure Congressional approval of United States
                        participation in the proposed Organization for Trade Cooperation. The fact
                        that the United States had employed Section 22 restrictions sparingly, with
                        the possible exception of those imposed on dairy products, had also
                        influenced the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that the
                        balance-of-payments provisions of the renegotiated <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> were substantially the same as the present provisions.
                        However, there had been some simplification of them, and there was provision
                        for their more effective enforcement. A change in their emphasis in the
                        direction of the United States point of view had also been effected. A new
                        feature of them provided for regular consultations by all countries imposing
                        quantitative restrictions for balance-of-payments reasons. These
                        consultations would be on an annual basis for the developed countries, and
                        on a biennial basis for the underdeveloped countries. Under the present
                        arrangements, all countries are not required to consult at the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> sessions.</p>
                    <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0137"/>
                    <p>Related to the balance-of-payments provisions was the “hard core” problem,
                        i.e. the desire of certain countries to continue to restrict imports after
                        the balance-of-payments justification for such restrictions had come to an
                        end. This problem was handled by a waiver arrangement which was considerably
                        more strict than that covering the Section 22 waiver of the United States.
                        Countries desiring to impose “hard core” restrictions would have to secure
                        specific approval of the Contracting Parties, would have to show that the
                        product in question had received incidental protection during the period
                        when balance-of-payments restrictions were being imposed, that the removal
                        of the restrictions on imports of the products concerned would work severe
                        social and economic hardship on the applicant country, and that no other
                        means was available for handling the problem under the Agreement except
                        through the imposition of temporary restrictions on imports. The country
                        satisfying the Contracting Parties on these points would still be required
                        to furnish annual reports on the measures taken in connection with the
                        waiver, the policy it was following in order to eliminate the causes of the
                        problem, and, in addition, would have to guarantee to other countries that
                        the volume of imports from them would be no less than that which had been
                        permitted during the period when the general restrictions imposed for
                        balance-of-payments reasons had been in effect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> referred to the problem of
                        the underdeveloped countries at the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        Session. He stated that it had been generally agreed that some relaxation of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rules would be necessary in order
                        to encourage the underdeveloped countries to continue to adhere to the
                        General Agreement. To meet this problem Article XVIII of the renegotiated
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> was made more flexible than the
                        existing Article. The underdeveloped countries would have slightly more
                        freedom than they now have to withdraw or modify tariff concessions, and to
                        impose quantitative restrictions for the protection of infant industries.
                        Moreover, they would only be required to consult every other year in
                        connection with restrictions imposed for balance-of-payments reasons.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that
                        all the other <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries were looking
                        anxiously to the United States to see what this country would do vis-à-vis
                        the proposed Organization for Trade Cooperation. He pointed out that if the
                        United States does not join the Organization then it will not come into
                        existence. Other countries feel that United States willingness to
                        participate in the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is more important
                        than the passage of H.R. 1. This feeling is based not only on the importance
                        of the United States in the world trade community, but also because the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> after seven years, has much to
                        commend it as an instrument of international trade policy. <pb n="108"
                            xml:id="pg_108" facs="0138"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                            >Brown</persName> concluded his remarks by paying warm tribute to the
                        members of the United States Delegation and the excellent cooperation the
                        Delegation had received from Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> asked whether there were
                        any comments the members of the group desired to make.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Marget</persName> stated that he was pleased that the United
                        States had emerged so well from the Geneva negotiations. In his opinion, the
                        Agreement was respectable, forward-looking and, in addition, it made
                        sense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> noted that Treasury had
                        some problems in connection with the degree of latitude that was to be given
                        to the underdeveloped countries and also with respect to the possibility
                        that commodity arrangements might be associated with the proposed
                        Organization. He asked whether it would be possible to state during the
                        presentation of the Organization Agreement to the Congress that the
                        Agreement was reasonably divorced from commodity arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that when the United
                        States Delegation went to Geneva it found a strong desire among the majority
                        of the countries for the creation of a world trade organization that would
                        deal with all aspects of international commerce. Several countries made a
                        strong effort to include Chapter 6 of the Havana Charter in the renegotiated
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. This effort was defeated. A
                        Working Party had been created to develop a separate convention on
                        international commodity policy. The United States did not participate in the
                        Working Party but its influence was felt. If the work of this separate
                        Working Party materialized, a separate international body with functions in
                        the commodity field would be created. This body would be opened to all
                        governments for membership, including countries not members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. He felt that it would be accurate to say
                        that the commodity agreement drafted at the Ninth Session had been “split
                        off” from the proposed <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> expressed some concern
                        over the fact that so many other governments were desirous of establishing
                        agreements in the international commodity field. In his view such agreements
                        were the complete opposite of everything which the United States
                        represented.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> noted that a problem
                        appeared to be developing in connection with a strong desire in the Congress
                        to impose import restrictions on foreign oil. He asked what the situation
                        would be under the renegotiated <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> if
                        such restrictions were imposed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated that import
                        restrictions might be imposed as part of an escape clause action. He noted,
                        however, that such restrictions would have to be non-discriminatory in
                        character, and that if they were imposed for reasons of national security
                        they <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0139"/>would still have to be
                        non-discriminatory. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> noted
                        that a certain amount of automatic discrimination was involved in the
                        selection of the base periods used in connection with the allocation of the
                        import quotas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHC1">Rose</persName> asked whether there would be
                        any change in the escape clause provisions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> replied
                        in the negative, stating that a contracting party would still have the right
                        to withdraw or modify concessions under Article XIX. Countries affected by
                        such withdrawals or modifications would be free to withdraw such
                        compensatory concessions as the Organization would not disapprove.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> asked whether the removal of
                        quantitative restrictions for balance-of-payments reasons might be
                        accompanied by a rise in escape clause actions with respect to imports from
                        the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> stated
                        that such actions might increase but that they would not amount to more than
                        two or three a year at the very most. He did not think that this figure
                        would be significantly increased after convertibility.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> stated that the United
                        States Delegation appeared to have fulfilled very well the objectives of the
                        President’s message of March 30, 1954 on foreign economic policy in which he
                        had indicated that the Administration would seek a review of the General
                        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<note n="12" xml:id="d26fn12">The President’s

                    <p>Tariff Commission’s recommendation for increasing bicycle duties<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d27fn2">Telegram 4762 to London, March 18, informed the Embassy
                            that the Tariff Commission had recommended increased rates of duties on
                            bicycles. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 411.004/3–1855) The
                            recommendation followed an escape clause investigation under the Trade
                            Agreements Extension Act of 1951, which provided for the withdrawal of
                            trade concessions which threatened serious injury to domestic producers.

                        call them to your attention, although I am sure you are aware of them.</p>
                    <p>Its potential effects on whole effort toward expanded international trade and
                        on political as well as economic relations with the United Kingdom make the
                        bicycle recommendation easily the most important escape clause case to
                        date.</p>
                    <p>Efforts over the past few years to reduce aid dependence by encouraging
                        British manufacturers to develop US markets have encountered one basic fear;
                        that if British businessman invests capital and effort necessary for
                        successful sales drive in world’s toughest competitive market, he simply
                        risks being arbitrarily shut out by action under escape clause.</p>
                    <p>In bicycle case, British manufacturers were somewhat reluctantly persuaded to
                        take part in dollar-earning drive and have been remarkably successful. They
                        have really created new market in US by making and selling at reasonable
                        price an item of high-quality standards. While price has no doubt played
                        some part, fundamental reason for British success has been good light-weight
                        design and well-organized sales effort. Over the years, this British
                        initiative has resulted in an enlarged market for US producers as well.</p>
                    <p>Escape clause decision on watches<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">On May 28, 1954,
                            the Tariff Commission submitted a report to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> recommending certain duty
                            increases on Swiss watches. By his proclamation of July 27, 1954, the
                            President implemented the committee recommendations. A convenient
                            summary of U.S. actions regarding Swiss watches is in <hi rend="italic"

                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, since it clearly involved defense
                        industry considerations. These are not present in bicycles case. Adverse
                        decision this case would be taken as sign of probable course of action in
                        much wider field.</p>
                    <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0141"/>
                    <p>Bicycles are therefore a crucial test of the whole idea of “trade not aid”.
                        Entire British business community, and of course the Government, are
                        watching this case with intense concern. If tariffs are raised, British will
                        feel that effort to stand on own feet and earn dollars they need to buy
                        American products faces frustration, and that US Administration’s interest
                        in expanded world trade is words not deeds. Such action would give aid and
                        comfort to those in Britain and Europe generally who argue that economic
                        cooperation with the US is impossible and who would willingly undermine the
                        fabric of our political and security alliance.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, when details of Tariff Commission’s report are made public, it
                        will be difficult to explain injury in view of fact that US production
                        increased steadily from 1949 through 1953 at same time imports were also
                        increasing steadily. Though lower in 1954, production was still much higher
                        than pre-war. Tariff Commission majority’s case in fact seems based almost
                        entirely on 1954 decline, which on basis of past experience of industry may
                        be a normal fluctuation in output. Impression general here that US producers
                        are failing to produce the type of bicycle the US consumer wants, and are
                        continuing to demand tariff protection rather than making the required
                        adjustment.</p>
                    <p>President of Board of Trade has asked to see me Friday and I expect he will
                        express the Government’s dismay over the recommendation in strong terms.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate grave difficulties of Administration’s position with H.R. 1
                        pending, but for above reasons I profoundly hope that Tariff Commission
                        recommendation will be rejected as incompatible with national interest.</p>

                    <p>The Governments of Great Britain and certain Western European countries have
                        indicated great concern about the Tariff Commission’s recommendation to
                        increase duties on bicycles. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWW1"

                        The British have in addition delivered a strongly worded Aide-Mémoire<note

                        effect of such an increase on future US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        trade relations.</p>
                    <p>Acceptance of the Tariff Commission’s recommendation could stimulate adverse
                        political and psychological effects among our Allies, far out of proportion
                        to the grievances claimed by the United States industry. This case appears
                        to be a crucial one in terms of the future of our announced trade
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>I, therefore, recommend that the Tariff Commission proposal to increase
                        bicycle duties be turned down.</p>
                    <p>I am acutely aware, however, of the relationship of the case to H.R. 1. It
                        seems most important that the Tariff Commission’s recommendations be turned
                        down in a manner that is not prejudicial to the enactment of H.R. 1. I think
                        it will be helpful if representatives of the Department discussed procedures

                    <p>The intensive review not being conducted by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                            >CFEP</gloss> is directly pertinent and responsive to the Secretary’s
                        question, and is being conducted as expeditiously as possible. (The
                        Intelligence study alone on which considerations must be based has been
                        given high priority and will be ready about the middle of May.) Therefore,
                        barring crisis situations and overriding developments, it would seem
                        desirable to permit the study to move ahead as expeditiously as possible and
                        meanwhile to withhold judgment on the desirability of a complete embargo on
                        agricultural exports to the European Soviet bloc. The modest character of
                        U.S. agricultural trade with the Soviet bloc as indicated by the figures in
                        Tab A would seem to demonstrate that no serious damage could result from
                        such course of action.</p>

                            TO THE SOVIET BLOC</head>
                        <p>Total U.S. exports to the entire bloc in 1953 were valued at only $2
                            million, three-quarters of which consisted of tobacco products <pb
                                n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0145"/>and wool rags. In 1954 total
                            exports were valued at $6 million. Over $3 million of this comprised
                            flood relief shipments of agricultural surpluses to East Germany,
                            Hungary and Czechoslovakia, $0.5 million was in tobacco products,
                            another $0.5 million in inedible tallow, and over $1 million in wool
                            rags.</p>
                        <p>Exchanges of government-owned agricultural surpluses for strategic
                            materials with the bloc in barter deals appear, at least for the
                            present, to be ruled out by a Justice Department legal opinion of
                            February 21, 1955.<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">Memorandum from Rankin to

                        <p>Direct dollar sales of surpluses acquired from government-owned stocks by
                            private traders, where the sales price is less than the government’s
                            investment, have been disapproved on policy, not legal, grounds. This
                            policy was fixed in January 1954 when the Cabinet decided not to permit
                            licensing of butter exports to the Soviet bloc on the grounds (1) that
                            the U.S. should not sell this commodity at a loss, and (2) that adverse
                            public reaction would follow the sale of butter to the USSR at a price
                            below that paid by American housewives.</p>
                        <p>In February 1954 the Cabinet further decided “as a matter of policy to
                            deny commercial export license applications for the export <hi
                                rend="italic">for cash</hi> of U.S. Government-owned surplus
                            agricultural or vegetable fibre products to Russia or her satellites.”
                            At that time the Cabinet agreed that there would be no objection to
                            bartering perishable agricultural surpluses to the bloc in exchange for
                            strategic minerals. At the present time, however, barter exchanges
                            appear to be precluded, in view of the Justice Department opinion of
                            February 21, 1955.</p>
                        <p>This would leave only two theoretical possibilities for the export of
                            agricultural products to the bloc. The first possibility is in the area
                            of private transactions involving products acquired from commercial
                            stocks. Such transactions have not been of interest to the bloc, as may
                            be noted from the figures cited above.</p>
                        <p>The remaining possibility would be direct government-to-government sales
                            for dollars. Such sales are legally permissible, but they have not been
                            affirmatively declared to be desirable on policy grounds; and the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decided in April 1954 that, in the
                            event of such transactions, there must be a clear advantage to the U.S.
                            and no material injury to the trade of friendly countries.</p>

                    <p>The most important aspect of this case seems to us to be not the potential
                        damage to the European bicycle industry, but the fact that the Europeans
                        generally regard it as a crucial test of our future trade policy. The
                        British have made this abundantly clear on several occasions; they
                        invariably stress the effect of an adverse decision on all British exports.
                        The Europeans joined in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> resolution
                        of March 25 which states in part that approval of the Tariff Commission
                        recommendation so soon after the Swiss Watch case, “to increase protection
                        against goods of special interest to European exporters and in which they
                        show competitive efficiency would not fail to have widespread repercussions
                        on the confidence and initiative of all exporters and potential exporters of
                        European goods to the U.S. market”.</p>
                    <p>If we revert to protectionism in this case, the pressure on other countries
                        to move in the same direction will be greatly increased. Such a trend would
                        run counter to all that we have advocated in the field of economic policy
                        for Europe since the war.</p>

                    <p>On May 11, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                        requested the Tariff Commission to update its figures and analysis of the
                        bicycle case to ensure that the decline in domestic bicycle production
                        indicated a persistent <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0148"/>trend
                        instead of a temporary variation. The Commission’s report contained figures
                        only through 1954. The President asked that the Commission provide data as
                        far as possible into 1955 and estimate the industry’s prospects for the
                        remainder of the year. He wrote that it was important to know whether the
                        first quarter economic surge affected bicycle sales and to what degree the
                        lagging profitability of the U.S. industry was the result of an inadequate
                        response to shifting American preferences. He asked the Committee to submit
                        its findings no later than July 15. For texts of the White House

                        countries, including the United States, have negotiated reciprocal tariff
                        concessions with Japan. The results of the negotiations, especially as
                        concerns the balance of concessions obtained and granted by the United
                        States, must be approved by the President before the United States
                        negotiators can enter into an agreement embodying the concessions that have

                    <p>The negotiation between the United States and Japan, after an initial setback
                        caused by Japanese misunderstanding of the negotiating techniques, proved
                        very substantial and entirely satisfactory. The United States negotiators
                        were able to obtain Japanese tariff bindings or reductions (chiefly the
                        former) on goods of which United States exports to Japan in 1953 were valued
                        at $395 million. In exchange we granted concessions binding or reducing
                        United States tariffs on goods of which imports from Japan were valued in
                        1953 at $123 million.</p>
                    <p>The tariff negotiations between third countries and Japan were considerably
                        less comprehensive than our own, even though we intervened, where feasible,
                        to expand the scope of such negotiations by offering to make up to the third
                        countries compensation Japan could not provide. The decision of the United
                        Kingdom not to participate in the negotiations, taken early last November,
                        made the smaller European countries hesitant to negotiate especially since
                        France took the same attitude. As a result the important <gloss
                            target="#t_Benelux1">Benelux</gloss> countries reversed an earlier
                        decision and did not negotiate with Japan. The United Kingdom’s later public
                        announcement, in mid-April, that it would not accept <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rights and obligations with Japan
                        intensified the difficulty. Moreover, since most of the countries that did
                        negotiate have little trade with Japan or buy more from Japan than they sell
                        to it, the possibilities for meaningful tariff concessions were limited.</p>
                    <p>A good beginning in helping to expand Japan’s trading opportunities has
                        nevertheless been made in the third country negotiations which cover
                        approximately an additional $13 to $14 million of Japan’s export trade. More
                        importantly, we anticipate that the negotiations will lead to a favorable
                        vote by the two-thirds majority required to bring about Japan’s accession to
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. With accession, Japan will be
                        assured the very important benefits of guaranteed <pb n="120"

                            <item>Cotton is in serious surplus in the U.S. and 1955 production is
                                limited to the minimum acreage permitted by law. Marketing quotas
                                and acreage allotments, approximately 15 percent less than in 1954,
                                are in effect for the 1955 crop. It now appears that the August 1,
                                1955, carryover will be about 10.7 million bales, the highest since
                                1946. Of that total about 6.5 million bales will be owned by <gloss
                                    target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> and 1.7 million bales will be under
                                loan. The 1955 acreage is expected to be the lowest in 70 years. The
                                objective of the Department of Agriculture in its over-all cotton
                                production and distribution program is to reduce carryover stocks so
                                that on August 1, 1956, they will be reduced to about 7 million
                                bales. This would require the export of about 5 million bales.
                                Failure to export 5 million bales would necessitate a further
                                reduction of acreage below the extremely low 1955 acreage and would
                                create a considerable degree of additional hardship among cotton
                                producers.</item>

                            <item>Export of 5 million bales of cotton would be approximately equal
                                to the 1948–51 average and would be substantially less than our
                                pre-war share of world trade in cotton. <table rows="8" cols="3">

                            <item>The President has enunciated the following as export sales policy:
                                “The United States cannot be satisfied with the position of holding
                                its own supplies off the market and accumulating surpluses while
                                other countries dispose of their entire production. Accordingly, the
                                United States will offer its products at competitive prices. At the
                                same time the United States will not use its agricultural surpluses
                                to impair the traditional competitive position of friendly countries
                                by disrupting world prices of agricultural commodities.”</item>

                            <item>It is essential that there be established an export sales policy
                                for cotton for the 1955–56 marketing year. Current uncertainties are
                                resulting in virtual world wide stoppage in the export movement in
                                cotton. The Department of Agriculture has been subjected to
                                pressures from all sides (producer, Congressional, trade, and
                                foreign governments) for a policy announcement.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The 90% support price program of the United States has largely
                                fixed the price level of world cotton. It has guaranteed that there
                                will be no drastic declines in world cotton prices. Behind this
                                price umbrella cotton production expanded greatly in the old
                                cotton-producing countries and in many new producing areas of the
                                world. While foreign acreage expanded, the acreage allotted to the
                                United States producers was cut from 1953 plantings by 21 percent
                                for 1954, and an additional 15 percent for 1955. In fact the United
                                States producer has virtually borne the entire acreage reduction for
                                the world. His sacrifice has maintained the world price at a high
                                level, and encouraged foreign producers to expand acreage, and
                                capture historical American markets in which he has been denied full
                                participation because of his curtailed acreage. <list>

                            <item>The 90 percent support price program, and our withholding policy,
                                have not only protected the domestic and foreign cotton prices, but
                                the system has also protected the American and foreign synthetic
                                industries, particularly the rayon industry, which by pricing their
                                commodity just under the price of cotton, have made great inroads
                                into cotton consumption both in the United States and abroad. 1954
                                world consumption of synthetics in cotton equivalents amounted to
                                about 10 million bales. (U.S. portion of this was about 3.5 million
                                bales.) The result has been to further decrease the consumption of
                                American cotton, which has made additional contributions to the
                                present low cotton-acreage allotments. Unless it is changed the
                                present program will in the future cause further decreases in the
                                consumption of American cotton. Under existing law, with continued
                                increases in production per acre in the United States, this would
                                necessitate additional cuts in acreage allotments that would be
                                still more disastrous to individual producers and areas of the
                                Cotton Belt.</item>

                                the U.S. To withhold these supplies would enable all other exporting
                                countries to dispose of their entire output at maximized selling
                                prices, while the U.S. producers would be required to cut production

                        cases which would run counter to the liberal trade policies we have both
                        been pursuing. Any such action would, in my sincere view, be likely to cause
                        quite disproportionate harm in this country and in Western Europe. Adverse
                        public reactions here and in Europe must hinder the efforts we are all

                        policies would go far to destroy hopes in the free world which no one has

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Chief</hi>: The Government now has before it a
                        proposal to adjust upward the tariff on foreign-made bicycles (Investigation
                        #37 of the Tariff Commission).</p>
                    <p>We feel that the imposition of higher tariffs on the imports of bicycles will
                        cause serious injury to the American farmer.</p>
                    <p>Four of the principal exporters of bicycles to the U.S. are the United
                        Kingdom, West Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Last year these
                        countries combined sold about $20 million worth of bicycles to the U.S. They
                        bought over $1 billion worth of farm products from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The bicycle case under current consideration is attracting considerable
                        attention in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom and West Germany.
                        Early in June, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture <persName
                            corresp="#p_BEL1">Earl Butz</persName> was in London, Bonn, and Paris,
                        where he was in conference with high government officials in the Ministries
                        of Agriculture, Commerce and Finance, relative to liberalization of trade
                        restrictions against U.S. farm products being imported into those
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> reports that
                        top government officials in London and Bonn, particularly, are quite
                        perturbed over the possibility that U.S. tariffs on bicycles will be
                        increased. These people probably have blown the bicycle case up out of
                        proportion to its real importance. However, they are watching our action on
                        it with keen interest. The foreign press is discussing it. They feel this is
                        a special market in the U.S. which the British and the West Germans have
                        developed themselves, and which the American manufacturers now want to take
                        over. They feel the action we take in this case will demonstrate our
                        sincerity (or lack of it) in our efforts to liberalize trade on a mutually
                        beneficial basis.</p>
                    <p>Upon his return to the United States, Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> stressed with me his firm conviction
                        that an upward adjustment in <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0157"
                        />bicycle tariffs at this time would seriously impede our efforts to obtain
                        liberalization of existing restrictions against import of agricultural
                        products into the United Kingdom, West Germany, and France.</p>
                    <p>We would be very much concerned, therefore, if action taken in this matter
                        should adversely affect our growing agricultural trade with the countries
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                    <p>On July 14, the Tariff Commission submitted its supplementary report on
                        bicycles to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. A
                        majority of the Commission held that domestic bicycle sales continued to
                        deteriorate and that escape clause relief remained justified. In a
                        memorandum of discussion with the President, July 27, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recorded: “We discussed the bicycle
                        case and I reminded him of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s
                        note on the subject and his reply. He said he was perplexed about what to
                        do. He thought it was difficult for him to avoid the finding of the Tariff
                        Commission that there was substantial injury due to imports and he did not
                        see how he could avoid it on ‘security’ grounds because no security
                        interests were involved.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, Meetings with

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> visited Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> to tell him of his conclusions on the
                        question of the U.S. Government cotton export price policy for the coming
                        marketing season beginning August 1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName> said that considering the attitude of Congress on
                        this question, the Executive Branch had to take action or else legislation
                        would be passed at the next session of Congress which would be much worse
                        than what the Executive Branch could do at this time. Accordingly, he said,
                        Agriculture planned to put out a press release shortly which would say that
                        the United States was going to be competitive in its exports of cotton and
                        that no commitment would be made with regard to an export subsidy during the
                        coming cotton year. Then, he said, about August 1 the Commodity Credit
                        Corporation would make an announcement that it will sell its stocks for
                        export on a competitive bid basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName> said that the program would be so administered by
                        the Agriculture Department that foreign producers should have no fear
                        because world market prices would not be seriously disrupted through this
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> said that he envisaged
                        the task of reducing <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>’s cotton stocks to
                        be a three-year job. He said he expected that within two years U.S. cotton
                        producers would be forced to accept a reduction in price supports on cotton
                        of perhaps five or six cents. In the meantime he expected a bill such as the
                        Ellender Bill<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">Presumably S. 2125, introduced on
                            June 1, by Senator Allen J. Ellender (<gloss target="#t_D1"
                            >D</gloss>–La.), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.</note> to
                        be enacted at the next session of Congress which would change the basis for
                        cotton price supports from 7/8” to 1” cotton, and thereby reduce supports by
                        two to three cents.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Nehmer</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName> whether bids would be accepted only if they are at
                        or above the support level. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName> said that bids would be accepted below the support
                        level if necessary. Mr. <persName>Nehmer</persName> then said that
                        considering the fact that the world supply of cotton was so much in excess
                        of the world demand, <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0159"/>it would
                        appear that the Agriculture Department program would have the effect over a
                        period of time of bringing down world cotton prices. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> said that this would not result
                        because Agriculture did not plan to administer this program in that way. He
                        repeated the point that foreign producers would not have to worry about this
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> said that a bigger
                        problem than the question of complaints from foreign producers was the
                        possibility of complaints from the domestic cotton textile industry because
                        the program would involve making raw cotton available to foreign textile
                        mills at a lower price than to domestic mills, and therefore, placing
                        foreign mills at a competitive advantage over domestic mills. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> said that probably what was
                        needed here was either a negotiated understanding with the Japanese
                        Government that they would keep down their cotton textile exports to the
                        United States or Section 22 action on cotton textile imports. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> said that the problem of the American
                        cotton textile industry was certainly a very serious one but that he hoped
                        that restrictions on imports of cotton textiles could be avoided. Mr.
                            <persName>Nehmer</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName> if it would be preferable to make raw cotton
                        available to U.S. mills at the export price to the extent of the domestic
                        mills’ requirements for raw cotton for the production of cotton textiles for
                        export, instead of limiting cotton textile imports. He said that he did not
                        know if the Agriculture Department had legislative authority to do this. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> agreed that Mr.
                            <persName>Nehmer</persName>’s suggestion might be preferable to import
                        quotas on cotton textiles. He thought Agriculture did have the legislative
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> what the timing was with regard
                        to an announcement by the Agriculture Department. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> said that he had hoped to have
                        an announcement out on Monday; however, he said, he recognized the fact that
                        there was going to be a tremendous clearance problem involved in getting
                        such an announcement out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>
                        asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> if the State
                        Department could have a look at the draft press release since it would be
                        most desirable, considering Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName>’s assurances that world prices would not be
                        reduced significantly, that words be used in the release to allay the fears
                        of foreign governments and foreign cotton producers. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> agreed that a release would be
                        shown to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> for State
                        Department comments. He said, however, that he would not wish to see any
                        words used which would have the effect of committing the Agriculture
                        Department in advance not to do various things with regard to selling our
                        cotton. He promised to get a draft release to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Nehmer</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McConnell</persName> planned to discuss this question in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Council. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McConnell</persName> replied that he saw <pb n="130"

                        in the <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> thanked Mr. <persName

                        <item>Agriculture presented for Council consideration a proposed public

                            cotton during the marketing year starting August 1, 1955. The statement
                            was to the effect that the U.S. would establish a two-price system
                            whereby <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> cotton would be sold for
                            export at competitive world prices (without any fixed price or quantity
                            stated) while the minimum price at which it would be sold domestically
                            would remain at the higher of (1) 105% of the current support price plus
                            reasonable carrying charges, or (2) the domestic market price, as
                            determined by <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Agriculture emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                            was expected to own about 6.4 million bales of cotton on August 1, 1955
                            out of a total carryover of 10.7 million bales while on the same date
                            last year the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> owned 1.75 million
                            bales out of a carryover of 9.7 million bales; the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> will acquire an additional 1.6 million
                            bales on November 1, 1955 from the 1954 crop; the 1955 crop which is
                            expected to be large, will soon begin to come on the market; current
                            U.S. exports are less than last year; the international price was about
                                <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0161"/>3 cents less than the
                            domestic price; the price was weak due to uncertainty about U.S. policy
                            on export sales as a result of large and growing U.S. stocks overhanging
                            the market. Agriculture’s proposal was to take off the established U.S.
                            policy not to sell cotton abroad below the domestic price; to sell
                            abroad in an orderly manner; not to meet lowest market offers; to assume
                            the Congress will act (Eastland<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">Presumably S.

                    <p>The Pres. referred to this cotton thing—he did not realize the heat in it. He
                        just had 60 Senators and Congressmen in—they are our friends as well as
                        otherwise. We have to study this to see if we can ease up the situation a
                        little bit. The Pres. is telling <persName>Benson</persName> to go back to
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>’s Comm. and then go to the
                        Sec. The Pres. said State has to look at it in a slightly larger view than
                        we must not hurt anyone’s feelings at all. The Sec. objected to the
                        implication in the above and said this program of
                            <persName>Benson</persName>’s was voted down 8-1 in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Comm. The Pres. told the group we
                        have to take a look at it—he said if you take friends away in the foreign
                        field, you will <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0163"/>pay more. They are
                        now comparing our Administration unfavorably with the past one. The Sec.
                        said State gets the rap on these things. The Pres. wants something that will
                        alleviate the situation and lead us in the right direction. <persName

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I attended, for a short time
                        this morning, the meeting at Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1"
                            >Benson</persName>’s office to discuss the cotton matter. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> was with me and also Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> were there.</p>
                    <p>I tried to make clear that we in the State Department are working for the
                        United States just as much as is anybody else and that I did not like it
                        when it was intimated to Congress, as it so often is, that we were primarily
                        concerned with pleasing foreign interests.</p>
                    <p>I said that if, for example, there was a projected cotton policy which would
                        gravely disrupt the economy of Mexico and which, because of its effect on
                        Pakistan and Egypt, would jeopardize the oil situation in the Middle East,
                        then I thought there was a duty to point that fact out. If it was decided
                        nevertheless to go ahead I would, of course, abide by that decision.</p>
                    <p>In the present case the Agriculture Department policy was, as you know,
                        opposed by all of the other agencies represented on the <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Committee. It was very strongly
                        opposed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>. However, it is
                        convenient for the Department of Agriculture people, at the lower level, to
                        concentrate blame on the State Department. I told Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> that I thought that ought to stop.
                        He agrees but admits that it is easier said than done.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> who was present will tell you
                        about the substance of the meeting.</p>

                    <p>I stopped in to see Senator <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> at

                        talk. Although our talk covered many things, he did not once mention
                        cotton.</p>

                    <p>[Here follows discussion of budget policy for fiscal year 1956 and the
                        President’s State of the Union message.]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">US Policy with Respect to <gloss target="#t_CCC1"
                                >CCC</gloss>-owned Cotton</hi>—The Secretary of Agriculture opened
                        the discussion of this subject by reminding his colleagues that under the
                        law he has the responsibility and legal authority to dispose of agricultural
                        surpluses. He pointed out that the proposal he would make to dispose of some
                        of our cotton surplus ought to be accepted and implemented now in order to
                        avoid much more drastic and unacceptable action by the Congress later. If
                            <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0165"/>we say we will never make a
                        move if it adversely affects any nation, then we will never get rid of any
                        of our surpluses. We have disposed of a great deal of surplus goods already
                        and most of them have gone abroad. If we don’t make some kind of move now we
                        will be faced, during the next session of Congress, with a law which will
                        undoubtedly set up a permanent two-price system for cotton, and
                        representatives of the cotton and wheat states will form an alliance to get
                        such a law written. Naturally, the last thing we want is a permanent export
                        subsidy on wheat and cotton. Stories are being spread that this
                        Administration is dedicated to Big Business and that Agriculture is not
                        important. In the last session of Congress we got 90% of what we wanted—in
                        the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1954. Because of certain gimmicks in the
                        law, however, cotton price supports themselves could not be changed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> stressed we have now made progress in getting
                        the public to understand that high rigid price supports are evil. We even
                        find some leaders saying that the 90% price support is hurting the cotton
                        industry. Now, it is up to us to show our good faith and help move some of
                        the cotton now in storage. The Secretary felt that if we do this Congress
                        will move at its next session to give us some legislation which will be
                        permanently helpful. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> then read the statement
                        of Agriculture’s position on this subject (see attached)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d42fn2">Not printed.</note> and a copy of the statement was at
                        this time distributed to each person in the room.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired what was meant by the phrase “competitive prices”. The
                        Secretary explained that this meant the process of bids which we reserve the
                        right to reject if the prices are so low as to disrupt world markets. The
                        resulting export price is, of course, usually lower than the domestic price.
                        He reminded the President that the government is now exporting quite a
                        sizeable list of surplus commodities at prices lower than domestic prices,
                        but that we have refused to sell these commodities in ways which would
                        disrupt world markets. The President reaffirmed that this was still
                        Administration policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary summed up by saying that Agriculture wished to be authorized to
                        move not more than a million bales of this low-grade cotton within the next
                        marketing year—probably after the first of March, 1956.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President’s request for his comments, Sec. Hukmphrey
                        explained that, from the short-range point of view, naturally Treasury would
                        like to see us sell the surplus commodities and get our money out of them.
                        In the long-range, however, the problem is essentially one of timing,
                        procedure and method. If we <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0166"
                        />announce now that we are going to sell cotton at less than domestic
                        prices, it will certainly frighten domestic textile producers who pay
                        domestic prices and will be against the Administration basic trade policy.
                        He pointed out that the growers who want an export subsidy for cotton have
                        teamed up with the domestic producers who want import quotas on cotton
                        textiles, and that what we are faced with is the double-barrelled pressure.
                        He did not believe that much of this surplus cotton would move without
                        wrecking world markets. It is true that we are losing cotton markets to
                        other nations, and this is wrong: we should certainly fight this at some
                        point. The method he proposed, however, was to go to the Congress next year
                        with an urgent request for a reduction in the support price for off-grade
                        cotton. If we get this law we can then sell this surplus abroad without
                        starting a two-price system and without dumping. This would be preferable to
                        making any announcement now that we are going to sell cotton, especially
                        since the proposed sale would not take place until March, and we might also
                        prejudice our chances of selling our regular export of 31/2 million bales.
                        Meanwhile, of course, we should continue to use every device to get rid of
                        our surpluses under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480, etc.</p>
                    <p>When the President asked if fats and vegetable oils were examples of recent
                        “dumping”, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName> explained that
                        world demand for fats went up just as we started to put these commodities up
                        for sale, so that we were just lucky with respect to them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> stressed that to announce our selling policy
                        now would serve notice to the world that we are not going to sit by and
                        continue to lose our fair share of world cotton markets to foreign
                        competitors. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> still
                        objected to making the announcement five months ahead of time, and then
                        commented that we are in the strange position of having, through technical
                        assistance programs, taught people all over the world how to raise cotton
                        more efficiently and even supplied them the tractors with which to grow it.
                        The Secretary of Agriculture emphasized again that we will not permit this
                        million bales to disrupt world markets and that in disposing of surplus
                        commodities to date, no markets have been disrupted yet. He questioned the
                        cited alliance between the farmers and mill operators, and pointed out that
                        they have promised us they will help support legislation which will get
                        support prices down. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName> made
                        the suggestion that we get some of the other cotton producing countries to
                        limit their production as we have limited ours.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> stated the case of American
                        business men who would, paying domestic cotton prices, find themselves
                        completely undercut by foreign textile mills who could buy US cotton cheap
                        and sell the cheaper finished product in the United States. The <pb n="137"
                            xml:id="pg_137" facs="0167"/>Secretary of Agriculture commented that we
                        are doing this to all sorts of commodities except cotton, and that many of
                        them would come back in the form of finished goods if the price spread were
                        too wide. He emphasized, however, that we will regulate the price
                        differential in accepting the bids and will not allow the price disparity to
                        be too much. He again emphasized that selling this million bales will help
                        us get the support of Members of Congress, who are the only ones who can
                        help us achieve a permanent solution to the problem of surplus cotton. Sec.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>, however, pointed out that
                        Japanese competition has made US business men very much afraid; an export
                        subsidy for cotton will appear to them as just another advantage given to
                        foreign producers.</p>
                    <p>The President asked for State Department comments, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> read a statement (copy
                            attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Not printed. The statement reads
                            in part: “The damage that can occur in our foreign relations would seem
                            to be out of proportion to the increased amount of cotton that it is
                            proposed to sell under this program.”</note> He ended with the comment
                        that this two-price system that we have has resulted in a virtual ban on the
                        import of so many agricultural commodities into the US and that this import
                        limitation caused us no end of trouble in negotiating <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> commented that we would
                        not expect to move any great quantities of cotton immediately, but that
                        announcement of this course of action would tend to put a stop to world
                        market expansion at our expense. He emphasized that what Agriculture was
                        proposing was not a radical measure and that Agriculture would not have
                        suggested it had we not insisted, with the Congressmen involved, that we had
                        to have them tackle this problem of support prices. The sale of a million
                        bales, he was convinced, was the surest route to the objective we all want
                        without the threat of extreme legislation. It would be a token of our good
                        faith, while the alternative would be a highly unacceptable law. The
                        President commented that some sixty Senators signed Senator Thurmond’s bill
                        for an out and out two-price system—this would be almost enough to override
                        a veto.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName> suggested that we privately
                        warn these other producing countries that, if they keep expanding at the
                        expense of our markets, we would have to do something. Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> emphasized there were just two ways
                        to solve this problem: either by an export subsidy, or by reducing our
                        domestic support price on off-grade materials. He warned against our trying
                        to do for cotton what Brazil did for coffee. This export subsidy technique
                        broke Brazil and would in time break us, too. He renewed his proposal to say
                        or do nothing now but make a determined fight in the Congress next year <pb
                            n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0168"/>for new legislation. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> pointed out that there were many
                        people even in the cotton industry who were against an export subsidy. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> commented that many, however, were in favor
                        of it. He assured his colleagues that Agriculture could terminate the sales
                        overnight if necessary; they have that authority. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> expressed sympathy with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName>’s suggestion about
                        consultation with other countries. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> explained
                        that we routinely invite in the Agricultural Attaches of the interested
                        countries—and further commented that even the Netherlands privately admits
                        we will have to sell our dairy surpluses at less than world prices.</p>
                    <p>Under Sec. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that
                        Egypt has already cut back her acreage but other countries are not in a
                        position to do this. In response to a question from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> about timing, Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> explained that we would make this
                        announcement now but not sell the cotton until all the crop was in this
                        year, i.e., next March. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                        commented that the effect of this would be to keep prices depressed all over
                        the world. The Secretary of Agriculture said he was convinced, however, that
                        there would not be any great reaction if we announce only this modest
                        program. He pointed out that other countries subsidize their cotton exports;
                        Pakistan, for example, used as one of its reasons for devaluating its
                        currency the helpful effect which this devaluation would have on cotton
                        exports. Mr. <persName>Wilson</persName> asked if the cotton in storage
                        deteriorated. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> said it did not. Mr.
                            <persName>Wilson</persName> then suggested that we offer some of this
                        cotton on the domestic market at a cut rate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> pointed out that the law prevented us from doing
                        this and that was the law that we wanted to get changed and thus be able,
                        later, to sell <hi rend="italic">off-grade</hi> material domestically at a
                        low price. The Vice President queried whether we can really get through a
                        law next session which would reduce the price support level. The President
                        said he was not completely convinced that this particular sale would help
                        that legislation. The Secretary of Agriculture pointed out that we are
                        engaging in this type of sale with respect to every other surplus commodity
                        except cotton—and now cotton presents us with the worst problem. Mr.
                            <persName>Wilson</persName> asked about the feasibility of having long
                        credit terms for export, and the Secretary of the Treasury pointed out that
                        there may be dozens of ways to move cotton and still keep the prices up but
                        one of our major problems is to dry up some of the foreign competition—and
                        the only way to do that is to get the domestic price support level
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President suggested that we announce (1) that our policy is to get
                        the law changed in January, and (2) that at some time we are going to make
                        some foreign cotton sales. This latter announcement might encourage other
                        countries to reduce some of their cotton production.</p>
                    <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0169"/>
                    <p>The Secretary of Agriculture pointed out that if we go to the Congress and
                        ask for new legislation, Congress will simply ask us what have we done under
                        the authority we now have; we have sold everything else but cotton—why
                        haven’t we sold cotton?</p>
                    <p>The President said we must get notice out to the world in some way that we
                        are not going to sit back and lose all our cotton markets. He cautioned,
                        however, against making an announcement now and taking all the disadvantages
                        which would be provoked in our international relations while not being sure
                        that we will get any advantages domestically or legislatively. Somehow,
                        however, the world should be given the picture as we see it. While other
                        countries’ cotton production is expanding we have reduced our acreage in
                        order not to embarrass our friends abroad. Perhaps nothing more formal than
                        a press conference statement should be used to put the world on notice—not
                        as a statement of fixed policy but as a warning. The President then
                        suggested that we abandon the practice of making a specific policy
                        announcement about the cotton market. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>, <persName>Benson</persName>, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that while perhaps this
                        was not a good position for the US to be in, the whole world, both importing
                        and exporting countries, was nevertheless waiting tensely for the US
                        marketing policy announcement which was actually due a month ago. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that with
                        eleven million bales of cotton in surplus we are the market. He suggested
                        that, in announcing our prices for this year, we should say we are going to
                        the Congress in January and ask for a cut in price supports. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> commented that people already know that this
                        is our policy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Commerce felt that if we could hold out for four or five
                        months more, we could get some legislation which would finally help us. The
                        President commented that this was not the temper of the group who came to
                        see him last week in his office about this very subject. When he had
                        suggested to them that the real solution was to reduce the 90% price
                        support, he didn’t get a single bit of support from that group. Even so
                        conservative a Senator as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRB1"
                            >Russell</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRB1">Richard B. Russell</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_D1">D</gloss>–Ga.).</note> said he was in favor of a
                        two-price system. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> repeated his belief that
                        the President would have a two-price bill on his desk next year unless we
                        make some token move of cotton now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> commented that a two-price system for other
                        commodities was not the same as that for cotton, since the other surplus
                        commodities do not “rebound” to the same extent in the form of manufactured
                        imports.</p>
                    <p>The President mentioned that Senator <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> told him that he had disposed of seven million
                        bales of cotton when he was <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0170"
                        />Secretary of Agriculture—without even making a ripple in world markets.
                        The Secretary of State asked if it was not one of the objectives of this
                        proposal to make a ripple in world markets in the sense of putting the world
                        on notice that the expansion of foreign cotton production at our expense has
                        got to stop. Unless this proposal makes a splash, so to speak, it will not
                        have the beneficial effect of preventing some of that foreign expansion. The
                        Secretary of Agriculture said we simply want to announce to the world that
                        we will sell cotton competitively and fairly—under controlled conditions.
                        The Secretary of State again asked if this would be enough and done in such
                        a way as to slow up foreign production. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> said
                        it would have that effect since the world knows that we have eleven million
                        bales of cotton behind us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> asked how much of a price spread Agriculture would
                        expect between the domestic price and the export price. If it were something
                        like 3¢ a pound this would not disrupt markets very much but it also would
                        not discourage very much foreign cotton acreage expansion. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> commented that the cotton we hold is even
                        over-priced domestically and thought that the export price would not be much
                        lower than the domestic price.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that if we think we have a problem now, then just
                        wait until next year when we will really have pressure from the Congress. He
                        pointed out that we have been holding eight million bales of cotton up to
                        now and we could continue to hold it. Announcing this new policy, however,
                        would let the world know we are going to enter world markets
                        competitively—but not with the whole eight million bales.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> summarized the problem as:
                        finding the way which will most helpfully influence the development of
                        constructive legislation. Perhaps, he said, we should export some of this
                        cotton at a lower price and at the same time tell the American manufacturers
                        there will be no import quotas. This would certainly arouse our domestic
                        manufacturers to yell for changes in the law.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the question of how to make this announcement palatable, the
                        President suggested that the State Department take the line that we are
                        protecting our friends abroad against the threat of very harmful
                        legislation; we are taking a step such as this now rather than being faced
                        with something much worse later. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> added that
                        we could emphasize that we are selling only one grade and only a certain
                        quantity.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State then stated that he was not so much concerned about
                        what we said or how this was announced; his true point of concern was what
                        would actually happen to the economies of Pakistan and Egypt, for instance,
                        if these economies should fall into a tail-spin just at the time when
                        neutralism is gaining ground in <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0171"/>the
                        Near East. This would jeopardize the whole oil situation. If we handle this
                        cotton export proposal in such a way as would not disrupt world markets, it
                        will probably work out all right. He commented, however, that this
                        conservative proposal will probably not achieve our objective of drying up
                        foreign expansion. It would be unlikely that we would achieve this goal
                        unless we engaged in a drastic dumping program. The Secretary of State said
                        that as far as State was concerned he could live with the kind of proposal
                        Sec. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> had in mind.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if we could put a limit on sales in any one month. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> replied that this might not be wise. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> again summed up by
                        pointing out that a combination of foreign export subsidy-import quotas
                        would be wholly bad. A reduced support price and an increased participation
                        in world cotton markets would be good, but that we would be voluntarily
                        doing a little of the bad to achieve the good. The President commented that
                        we ought to put US growers on notice that they should try to switch more
                        from lower grades of cotton to the long staple grades where we have much
                        less of an export problem.</p>
                    <p>The President then requested the Secretary of Agriculture to lay the question
                        out in black and white for Cabinet next week in the form of a specific
                        policy statement for the government to follow for one year and also, in the
                        same document, a proposed press release which would be as persuasive as we
                        can make it toward the climate of opinion we want to produce. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> added that we could even say that we
                        disfavor a policy of export subsidies.</p>
                    <p>The President explained that he was convinced that next year we might get
                        very bad legislation which we might not be able to handle. The Secretary of
                        Commerce said he could still bring forward evidence which would show that we
                        would be better off by waiting until the first of the year. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that he would
                        very much like to see this laid out in writing. The President commented that
                        perhaps we should call in some of the countries involved and talk frankly to
                        them, thus giving our friends some preparation for what our policy may
                        be.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that Agriculture would draw up the paper requested by the
                        President and would submit it to State, Commerce, and Treasury for comment
                        during the week. The President said he wanted the document for press release
                        in mild terms without any commitment to a two-price system. He ended the
                        discussion by pointing out that every time the United States, it seems,
                        tries to do anything to get its own economy back in shape, after the
                        mismanagement of twenty years, foreign countries always set up a chorus of
                        “this will break us”—even though we have given them millions in aid. For us
                        to acquiesce constantly is to get ourselves in a complete <pb n="142"
                            xml:id="pg_142" facs="0172"/>box. He closed the discussion by asking
                        everybody to consider not only his own Department’s particular views but all
                        the pros and cons of Mr. <persName>Benson</persName>’s proposal, remembering
                        that we face a very hostile Congress on this subject.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Department of State has
                        considered the recommendation of the Tariff Commission that the duty on
                        bicycles, both lightweight and heavyweight, be increased.</p>
                    <p>The foreign manufacturers of lightweight bicycles believe, with considerable
                        basis, that they have not taken a market away from the American bicycle
                        manufacturers but have developed a new market. They and their governments
                        argue that this is typically a case when duties should <hi rend="italic"
                            >not</hi> be raised to cancel out resourcefulness and inventiveness.
                        They feel that, under these circumstances, an increase of duty must be
                        interpreted as essentially a determination to follow a protectionist policy
                        without regard to the equities of particular situations.</p>
                    <p>It is our opinion that, under these circumstances, an increase of duty on
                        lightweight bicycles will be taken abroad as indicative of a protectionist
                        trend in the United States and will provide a new argument for those in
                        other countries who seek higher tariffs as against those who are seeking to
                        reduce trade barriers.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the heavyweight bicycles, the same argument cannot be made.
                        However, we should note that the principal exporter to the United States of
                        heavy bicycles is the Federal Republic of Germany which the United States is
                        now pressing for a reduction of duties on United States agricultural
                        products. We feel that this effort has a good chance of success, although we
                        cannot be certain of success. We do, however, feel that failure is almost
                        certain at this time if the duty on heavy bicycles is increased.</p>
                    <p>Quite apart from this particular effort, we agree generally with the views
                        expressed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> in his
                        letter to you of July <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0173"/>11,
                            1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2"><ref target="#d36">Document
                            36</ref>.</note> that an upward adjustment in bicycle tariffs at this
                        time would seriously impede our efforts to obtain liberalization of existing
                        restrictions against imports of agricultural products into the countries
                        which now manufacture and export bicycles to the United States, notably the
                        United Kingdom, West Germany and France.</p>
                    <p>It should perhaps be noted that the United Kingdom, which is the principal
                        exporter of bicycles to the United States, imports from the United States
                        approximately $800,000,000 worth of goods a year, whereas it exports to the
                        United States only about $500,000,000 of goods a year. The deficit is
                        covered, presumably, by invisibles and triangular trades.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName>
                        has personally communicated to you the concern which would be felt in the
                        United Kingdom if bicycle duties were increased.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State has also received strong representations on this
                        matter from other governments concerned, i.e. West Germany, France, the
                        Netherlands, Austria and Belgium.</p>
                    <p>These are the international and foreign affairs factors which you may want to
                        weigh along with such other factors as may be involved.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> opened the Cabinet’s second discussion of
                        this subject by summarizing several points: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Reports from abroad indicate that the expansion of foreign cotton
                                acreage has been made at the expense of needed food and feed crops
                                and that this has adversely affected the diet of some of the
                                countries involved.</item>

                                competitive. (The Secretary at this point read excerpts from a
                                magazine article to prove his point.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>There is some opposition to Agriculture’s proposed course of
                                action from some of the larger U.S. cotton producers—those who have
                                spent a good deal of money to develop the foreign cotton
                                industry.</item>

                            <item>We must let the world know that we are going to sell more
                                competitively and fairly or else quit completely so that world

                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>A Canadian agent has recently said that he would buy four hundred
                                thousand bales if the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> would meet
                                world prices. He has now gone to Mexico to make his purchase.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Agriculture said it was of course important that
                        representatives of friendly nations be notified in advance of our
                        intentions. He thought it was important that the announcement of this
                        marketing policy be made when the world cotton markets themselves are not
                        open. Ideally we should announce our policy this afternoon since both
                        European and U.S. markets are closed. If necessary the announcement could
                        come tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>The President mentioned that he had a telegram from Representative <persName
                            corresp="#p_MJW1">Martin</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2"><persName
                                corresp="#p_MJW1">Joseph W. Martin</persName> (<gloss target="#t_R1"
                                >R</gloss>–Mass.), House Minority Leader.</note> warning that if we
                        sold cotton more cheaply than <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> prices we
                        must put quotas on cotton imports. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> pointed
                        out that such a small quantity is involved that quotas will not be
                        justified. In answer to the President’s question whether this million bales
                        would depress the market, the Secretary said it would hardly put a ripple in
                        it. He pointed out that foreign millers are even now getting cotton more
                        cheaply from foreign growers than from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> reminded his colleagues
                        that S. 2702, sponsored by Senator Eastland and sixty others, specifically
                        calls for the imposition of quotas and that it is the understanding in the
                        South that quotas will be a part of this “package.” He warned of the
                        misunderstanding when manufacturing people think that quotas are part of
                        what is involved and we do not. He said he was sympathetic with
                        Agriculture’s desire to get rid of the surplus cotton, but that it is not
                        really just to have foreign manufacturers given a better price on cotton
                        than our own Government gives to domestic manufacturers. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> suggested that we wait until Congress
                        comes back; we might get something helpful and beneficial all around—perhaps
                        changing the pattern of supports.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> also made the
                        suggestion that we sell cotton at world prices to domestic manufacturers
                        provided that they guarantee that the product of that cotton is sold only in
                        the export market.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> said that this could
                        not be done without new legislation and added that the Department of
                        Agriculture would not look with disfavor on such legislation. He felt that
                        the course of action advocated by Senator Eastland went too far but he was
                        convinced that if we move now we have a better chance of getting <pb n="146"
                            xml:id="pg_146" facs="0176"/>some reasonable legislation. We are
                        offering a small quantity in a market which is already below our domestic
                        price.</p>
                    <p>The President then pointed out that we say we are not going to break the
                        world market and then asked when even a part of those million bales is going
                        to move. Only if the price goes down, he thought. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> then pointed out that the
                        consumption of cotton is rather low in some countries; very little of the
                        type and grade of cotton involved here is consumed in this country;
                        Agriculture believes that some of this grade of cotton will be consumed in
                        areas which have not consumed cotton before.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked whether we
                        will get the legislation we are hoping for and the Secretary of Agriculture
                        answered him by saying that we will have a much better chance if we make
                        this move now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> suggested
                        that we start to embark on this course of action without making any
                        announcement and simply wait for queries from the press. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> said this was such a sensitive matter we had
                        to say something. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName>
                        suggested using only the first paragraph of the suggested press release in
                            <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>–34<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Cabinet
                            Paper 34 contained a policy statement, “The Cotton Problem and First
                            Steps Toward Solution,” as well as a suggested press release.</note> and
                        the President questioned why <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>–34 was so
                        long. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> emphasized that we
                        had to make a fairly full statement since every word we said would be
                        examined with the utmost care in the cotton markets of the world. We should
                        even risk saying too much, but we must try to answer all the questions and
                        criticisms which would arise.</p>
                    <p>The President reflected that the bicycle decision was a hard one too; we are
                        not going to buy bicycles but we are going to insist that foreign countries
                        buy our cotton. Is this not inconsistent? Logically, he said, any increase
                        in import duties for bicycles is crazy but we get emotional about it. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> pointed out that there is a lot of emotion
                        about cotton too. The President said that he of course sympathized with Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName>’s argument. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> pointed out that cotton is sold in exchanges where
                        the laws of supply and demand apply particularly severely; bicycles are
                        different, not being sold in that way. The President rejoined that the
                        principle involved was the same. The President referred to the first
                        paragraph in the proposed press release, “no more than a million bales”, and
                        asked whether this will look like a limitation or will it scare people to
                        death. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> answered that it will be a notice to
                        the world that the trend of foreign cotton acreage expansion at our expense
                        had better stop since if it does not all our foreign markets will be taken
                        away from us.</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0177"/>
                    <p>It was suggested that a statement be inserted that “under the law the
                        Secretary of Agriculture has the authority” to do so and so—in other words
                        to quote the law. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> pointed out that people in
                        the cotton business know the law well. The President reminded him that the
                        rest of the world does not. The President also suggested that the gradual
                        nature of this sale should be emphasized in the press release, perhaps in
                        the third paragraph.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense asked why anybody buys any of our cotton. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> said the answer to that was that our cotton
                        is of exceptionally good quality.</p>
                    <p>The President said that we have got to take some action on this subject but
                        predicted that the question of quotas would start to hit us right in the
                        face if the world cotton market should start to break. If the price
                        differential is now three cents and then becomes four or five cents how can
                        we duck the problem of quotas? The Attorney General suggested that our
                        answer be that, in the coming January, we will go over with the Congress the
                        basic question of support prices.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> then asked about
                        consultation with the legislative leaders and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> assured him that they will be called
                        and consulted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Wilson</persName> wanted to be assured that the Secretary of
                        Agriculture had the clear legal right to take this course of action. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> so assured him and the President commented
                        that while he was responsible for what the Executive Branch does, Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> actually had the authority under the law.
                        This selling program, however, does not start until after the first of the
                        year. Mr. <persName>Wilson</persName> wondered whether this course of action
                        would endanger the three and one-half million bales of existing exports; to
                        add on the one hand and cut down on the other hand wouldn’t get us very far.
                        Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> pointed out that we cannot say for sure and
                        that we may not even sell a million bales at all. The President stated that
                        if we find we have made a mistake we can always reverse ourselves. He
                        pointed out that he is never too proud to admit it when he is wrong. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName> wondered whether the
                        market may have already discounted the probability of our taking this course
                        of action and pointed out that consumption went up in Asia last year. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> added that our own consumption had been
                        decreasing and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Stassen</persName> attributed
                        this to the use we are making of synthetics.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State said that he was acquiescing in the proposed course of
                        action but did want to point out that unless this operation does bring world
                        prices down it will not stop foreign planting. Foreign planting can perhaps
                        better be slowed down by talking with representatives of some of the
                        countries involved. No such talks have been held yet since the Executive
                        Branch has not <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0178"/>until now been in a
                        position to say: stop your planting and we will not dump our cotton. Only if
                        world prices go down will the course of action proposed in <gloss
                            target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>-34 put a damper on foreign cotton planting.
                        The President said he wasn’t so sure; that these other countries know that
                        all this cotton is here ready to sell. This might make them reflect. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that we
                        haven’t, however, sold any of this cotton for years and foreign countries
                        know it. But if we should start now a second dilemma arises: while it is
                        true that the foreign textile millers have been getting cotton below the
                        price that the U.S. millers pay, this has not been done as a result of the
                        latters own government’s action. Now the U.S. miller sees his own government
                        selling this cotton at a lower price to his competitors and this has a new
                        psychological impact. The proposed course of action would of course increase
                        rather than decrease the demand for quotas from U.S. manufacturers. This he
                        said was his best judgment of the situation but he was willing to defer to
                        the course of action proposed.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the size of our cotton imports and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> said about six percent of
                        our production is exported and one percent of our production is imported; in
                        other words we are exporting six times as much as we import. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> then read from the draft bill to which
                        he had referred earlier and from which it was evident that the southern
                        Senators are just as much interested in quotas as they are in the sale of
                        cotton. General <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName> pointed out
                        that from the talks he had had with some of the Senators concerned they are
                        not so much afraid of what is being imported now but they have a deep-seated
                        fear of future Japanese import competition. Secretaries <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> confirmed this impression. Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> commented that there was even some leeway in
                        that bill which would indicate that the Senators do not feel too strongly
                        about this.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the new Japanese trade agreement. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG1">Hauge</persName> replied that this agreement has in it
                        provisions for an absolutely bare minimum of textile imports; these
                        provisions had to be in there, else there would have been no agreement and
                        even no negotiations with the Japanese. There were some reductions made in
                        the tariffs on lower grades of cotton. The Tariff Commission concurred in
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The President said we have four months to see what happens. If the market
                        settles down in those four months we can let one hundred thousand bales a
                        month out. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> thought that the market would
                        probably firm up following this announcement. He said the buying has almost
                        stopped now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that
                        foreign planting will not stop. The President said perhaps we must explain
                        to them that if they keep on expanding, this problem is <pb n="149"
                            xml:id="pg_149" facs="0179"/>simply going to get more serious. The
                        Secretary of State, however, asked if we were really in a position to do
                        anything more than talk this way. The President thought that we could show
                        the foreign countries involved how gingerly we were going about this course
                        of action and we would suggest they be equally careful. The Secretary of
                        State emphasized that he wasn’t worried about what people will say but about
                        what might happen. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                        commented that somebody has simply got to be squeezed out of this business,
                        but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked “How?”</p>
                    <p>The President summed up by stating that there were so many views we had
                        better try something and see what happens. We are not going to make any
                        attempt to restore our original market position back to the time when we
                        sold so many million bales. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH1"
                            >Stassen</persName> commented that the sixth paragraph looks as though
                        we might be saying just that. Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> asked how much
                        time the State Department needed for consultations with the foreign
                        governments interested. The Secretary of State asked for 24 hours and
                        suggested that the announcement be made at noon on Saturday, August 13th.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> made a suggestion
                        about the procedure of consultation and the President asked that he discuss
                        this with the State Department. The President then requested that the
                        proposed press release be gone over again very carefully. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName> asked that Secretaries <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BET1"
                            >Benson</persName> should be sure to talk with Representative <persName
                            corresp="#p_MJW1">Martin</persName> on the phone about this decision.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> suggested that we
                        not only notify the Congressional leaders but have conversations with each
                        of them and make clear to them that we expect them to help us out of this
                        dilemma in the future. The President said we should emphasize we are taking
                        the best course of action we know how. The Secretary of State cautioned
                        against making too flat a statement about prospective legislation which we
                        expect next year and Mr. <persName>Benson</persName> referred him to the
                        language of the two closing paragraphs of the press release. The President
                        commented that we should plan to take up legislation next year which would
                        allow U.S. producers to buy cotton for export only (Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>’ suggestion). Mr.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> said that perhaps we could do what Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> suggested administratively
                        but we are not sure without further checking. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                            >Hauge</persName> asked whether enough analysis had really been made of
                        this course of action—which amounts really to a major policy departure. The
                        President closed the discussion by commenting wryly that this was one of
                        those problems about which no matter what one does is wrong.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Adams</persName>, at the end of the
                        Cabinet meeting, reminded his colleagues that Secretary <persName

                        officially informed the chairmen of the Senate Finance and House Ways and
                        Means Committees that he accepted most of the Tariff Commission’s
                        recommendations on the bicycle case. He concurred with the Commission
                        findings that the ad valorem rate for most imported bicycles should be
                        raised from 15 to 221/2 percent, with the exception of large wheel
                        lightweight bicycles where he determined that the rate should be increased
                        from 71/2 to only 111/2 percent instead of the recommended 221/2 percent.

                            that a contract could be awarded to a higher bidding U.S. company which

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Background</hi> The Joint Committee was established by an
                        exchange of notes November 12, 1953 following a Washington visit of the
                        Canadian Prime Minister with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> when they decided it would be advantageous to
                        have a permanent mechanism to consider economic and trade problems which are
                        so vital in the relations of the two countries. The Committee meets once a
                        year, with the site alternating between Ottawa and Washington. The first
                        meeting was held in Washington March 16, 1954. It was felt unwise to have
                        the 1955 meeting before the US Congress had completed consideration of HR-1;
                        then, owing to the heavy schedules of the Ministers involved, it was not
                        possible to arrange the meeting until September.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Commercial Policy Discussions</hi> Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, in his initial presentation, said
                        it was settled US policy to maintain a large market for imports and
                        explained that certain “minor” actions which might cause concern abroad did
                        not demonstrate a trend away from this policy. He suggested that these cases
                        tended to attract disproportionate attention from the good record of the US
                        in the commercial <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0183"/>policy field. He
                        added that it was not possible to have an economic policy completely immune
                        from politics and that there would have to be a certain measure of
                        protection of native industries against a large absorption of foreign
                        products. He suggested that countries having obtained a certain portion of
                        the US market should not press for its expansion to the point of forcing a
                        political issue which might result in restrictions. In this connection he
                        mentioned that the voluntary self-restraint of lead and zinc importers had
                        allowed local US producers to recover, and that the problem seemed on the
                        way to solution.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> pointed out that the
                        world dollar shortage which was so evident two years ago has changed.
                        Through trade, tourism, military and other aid programs, dollars have been
                        redistributed, with foreign governments increasing their dollar holdings by
                        slightly more than $11 billion and the US having $8.5 billion less. He
                        suggested trade may have been somewhat overemphasized as a means of bringing
                        about a balance as US aid declines and that a major part of the dollar flow
                        should be through private investment. In this regard he reiterated the need
                        to encourage other countries to make private investment attractive.</p>
                    <p>The Canadians, while agreeing to the importance of investment, emphasized the
                        importance of trade. They said there were some uncertainties with regard to
                        US commercial policy which caused Canadians concern. Delay in the
                        implementation of customs simplification had not allowed forward planning
                        for new or expanded markets. (US officials replied that they expected the
                        customs simplification bill to be passed, with amendments, early in the next
                        session.) The Canadians referred to the escape clause provisions of the
                        Trade Agreements Act as another unsettling factor and noted that escape
                        clause cases could be reopened year after year. They expressed hope that the
                        escape clause action would be taken only when overall injury to an industry
                        was proved. They also were concerned over the possible effects of the
                        national security clause of the Trade Agreements Act, stressing the mutual
                        security interests of the US and Canada. US officials replied that North
                        America was considered as a strategic unit. They stressed that Canada need
                        not fear that the President would look to the security clause to the
                        exclusion of basic economic issues when passing judgment on escape clause
                        applications.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Trade and Payments Problems</hi> The Committee shared the
                        view that a growing volume of mutually beneficial trade between Canada and
                        the US would develop most satisfactorily as part of a wide-spread system of
                        freer trade and payments. In that regard they noted the high rates of
                        employment and activity which had prevailed in most parts of the world and
                        that the level of international trade had been <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154"
                            facs="0184"/>generally well maintained during the past year. While some
                        progress had been made in removing restrictions and reducing discrimination
                        in many countries, there remained a need for further advances in this
                        field.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of recent developments which indicated a slowing
                        down in the progress toward convertibility. US officials reiterated US
                        desire that the pound become convertible. We feel that this is a British
                        responsibility and agree with them that it would be a mistake to adopt
                        convertibility without first making sure that it could be maintained under
                        most foreseeable circumstances.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Agricultural Surpluses</hi> The Canadians expressed strong
                        concern with regard to US agricultural surplus disposal procedures. They
                        pointed out that both countries have surpluses in wheat, oats and barley and
                        that Canadians market their goods without subsidy. They have about 300
                        million bushels of wheat for export annually and have developed markets over
                        the years to take care of this surplus. They said Canada has made an effort
                        to maintain a stable price in line with the world price of wheat but that
                        its exports have dropped during the last six months. They are now faced with
                        a bumper crop which will mean a larger surplus this fall. During the last
                        six months, the Canadians pointed out, the US has disposed of some 50
                        million bushels of wheat under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, the
                        mutual security program and on a bid basis for export, some of which went to
                        markets which are traditionally Canadian. They said that sale of wheat for
                        local currencies could not be considered as a normal commercial operation,
                        and noted that the US is also bartering agricultural surpluses for strategic
                        materials. They regarded as particularly serious the disposal of lots of
                        grain on a bid basis.</p>
                    <p>These US programs, the Canadians said, were having the effect of displacing
                        Canada in its traditional world markets. They felt that the US had not
                        consulted them sufficiently and asked that US and Canadian experts consult
                        on how this situation could be improved.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> said he appreciated
                        that the US price support system has outlived its usefulness and has put an
                        umbrella over world grain prices. The US has lost its old markets by holding
                        the price too high, he said, pointing out that US cotton markets have
                        dropped almost 50%. He emphasized that the US has tried to dispose of
                        surpluses in an orderly fashion and to secure assurances from other
                        countries that grain delivered under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                        will be in addition to usual grain requirements. <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480, he said, is a new tool which is an alternative to
                        Congressional proposals to effect sales at any price and resort to dumping.
                        He emphasized that the US Government has a storage bill for grain of $1
                        million a day and that the pressures to move our surpluses are terrific. The
                        US Government has tried to increase consumption and reduce acreage.
                            <persName>Benson</persName> said <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0185"
                        />that we had endeavored to establish a system of consultation with other
                        exporting countries. He agreed, since the Canadians considered that system
                        inadequate, to arrange for closer consultation.</p>
                    <p>In the course of discussion of surpluses the Canadians reported that their
                        Government is highly in favor of renewal of the International Wheat
                        Agreement, noting that this provides a good forum for consultation. US
                        officials replied that the International Wheat Agreement problem was still
                        under study in the US Government but that sentiment in the US seemed
                        inclined toward renewal of the Agreement.</p>

                    <p>143. It is Embassy’s considered view that Canadian resentment over US
                        agricultural surplus disposal policy is outstanding issue today between two
                        countries and one which easily could be inflated to unmanageable
                        proportions. With every indication of increasing surpluses on both sides of
                        border, problem is apt not only to be continuing one, but with normal crop
                        and marketing conditions may become even more acute.</p>
                    <p>All sectors of Canadian press have criticized US position and have castigated
                        our alleged failure dispose of surpluses without disturbing normal
                        commercial marketings.</p>

                        re willingness of US to dispose of its surplus agricultural products in any
                        fair and reasonable fashion and of utility of Washington talks.</p>
                    <p>Editor of Winnipeg <hi rend="italic">Free Press</hi> today told Embassy
                        officials that apparent failure of Canadian Ministers to present Canadian
                        position more forcefully at Joint Committee Meeting had created anger <pb
                            n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0186"/>among prairie province farmers
                        which he fears may have serious political implications. This same fear has
                        been expressed by other government officials and farm leaders with whom
                        Embassy has discussed matter.</p>
                    <p>Canadian officials challenge US contention that its disposal policies have
                        not injured normal Canadian markets and speak in bitterest terms re our
                        methods and their results. Two specific cases recently cited to Embassy by
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMW1">M.W. Sharp</persName>, Assistant Deputy
                        Minister Trade and Commerce and Canadian Government’s foremost expert on
                        international wheat trade, were: (1) Italy had requested Canadians to submit
                        wheat offers but Italian interest had “dried up” immediately it was known
                        that there was possibility of obtaining US surplus wheat; (2) West German
                        interest in Canadian wheat had declined as result of US officials indicating
                        to that country that its absorption of US wheat would be a criterion of its
                        willingness cooperate with US.</p>
                    <p>Canadian officials do not feel that implementation of our policy has resulted
                        in increased wheat consumption or that international demand for wheat has
                        been raised by facilities we have extended.</p>

                    <p>It should be realized that in Washington talks Canada will be interested not
                        only in having information on each specific deal US is contemplating but
                        also they will wish to consider whole realm of surplus disposal policy as a
                        joint problem.</p>
                    <p>Canadians consider that their restraint has been largely responsible for
                        maintaining international wheat prices and they insist that rising domestic

                    <p>Embassy fully appreciates that question of disposal of wheat surpluses poses
                        an almost insoluble problem. It is concerned, however, over possible grave

                    <p>It is Embassy’s opinion that there is some validity to Canadians contention
                        that US surplus wheat disposals have adversely effected normal Canadian
                        export sales. Unless some convincing evidence is given to Canadians that

                            September 9, 1954, to coordinate the administration of Public Law 480.
                            The Committee, headed by White House Special Consultant <persName
                                corresp="#p_FC1">Clarence Francis</persName>, consisted of senior

                    <p>Through the magnanimity of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, we were able
                        to obtain the services of Assistant Vice President Ernest T. Baughman as
                        Chairman of the study group. If the study has merit, the credit is due in no
                        small measure to the background knowledge and study, the good judgment, and
                        the objectivity Mr. <persName>Baughman</persName> brought to the work during
                        three months assiduous application.</p>
                    <p>The other members of the study group, assigned by <gloss target="#t_ICASD1"
                            >ICASD</gloss> members from their respective departments or agencies,
                        varied in numbers and participation as the needs from time to time required.
                        Without their spirit of cooperation the work would obviously not have been
                        possible. I wish to record my appreciation for their special
                        helpfulness.</p>
                    <p>In seeking the most useful term in which to cast the report, we have tried to
                        follow the middle course between a paper of a single-unequivocal point of
                        view and one representing the compromise among all points of view. The
                        former would run the risk of being doctrinaire, the latter of failing to
                        comply with your directive. Consequently, the study is submitted as a staff
                        document, rather than one representing the unanimous position of the
                        Committee. While its conclusions and recommendations correspond to my views
                        and, in any given case, I believe, the views of a substantial majority of
                        the Committee, they do not necessarily in every case represent the position
                        of the member departments and agencies. Committee members have been content
                        in the prospect of having their non-concurrencies presented in the Council
                        in due course.</p>
                    <p>In submitting the report, I feel I should recognize a fact which is
                        occasionally adverted to in its text. The attempt to access disposal
                        opportunities without reference to domestic policies responsible for the
                        accumulation lends the study a certain air of unreality. I’m sure the
                        Council was completely conscious of this in so restricting the study, nor do
                        I think this shortcoming vitiates its form.</p>

                        <p>This study was undertaken pursuant to a request of the Council on Foreign
                            Economic Policy that the Interagency Committee on Agricultural Surplus
                            Disposal submit “a report and such recommendations as may be appropriate
                            concerning the present laws, policies and programs for disposing of
                            agricultural surplus products abroad.” The request noted that it was
                            hoped to learn from the report “the extent to which it is practicable
                            and desirable to depend upon foreign disposal to meet the domestic
                            agricultural surplus problem and the most appropriate and effective
                            means of accomplishing such disposal.” Mentioned specifically for
                            consideration, “among such other things as may be pertinent,” were the

                        <p>There is little possibility of achieving a large enough increase in
                            exports to make substantial inroads on current surpluses of agricultural
                            commodities in the next few years. “Special” export programs initiated
                            or expanded in 1954–55 apparently have achieved some increase in United
                            States exports and a further moderate increase is indicated for 1955–56,
                            However, only in the event of widespread and repeated crop failures in
                            important producing countries would exports be likely to make
                            substantial reductions in current surpluses.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0190"/>
                        <p>The best opportunities for increasing exports without causing substantial
                            displacement of United States exports for dollars or of “usual” exports
                            of friendly countries exist in the low-income, low-consumption areas.
                            Agricultural surplus commodities can make an important contribution to
                            programs designed specifically to accelerate capital development and
                            increase consumption in such areas. Any additional efforts to expand
                            non-commercial exports of United States agricultural surpluses,
                            therefore, should give primary consideration to opportunities to use
                            them in support of investment programs, especially in the underdeveloped
                            countries. A program which emphasized that use of surplus commodities
                            would be essentially a foreign aid program; the financial return to the
                            United States would be small. Over the long-term, however, an increase
                            in productivity in the low-income areas could result in the development
                            of expanded export markets for United States commodities. Since capital
                            development programs require several years for completion, it would be
                            necessary to commit supplies of surplus commodities in support of such
                            programs for periods up to possibly 3 to 5 years.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> felt that the
                        recommendation was an over-simplified expression of a rather complex
                        process; he did not propose alternate language but indicated he might talk
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> about it. He said that
                        he did not believe such programs would necessarily result in permanent new
                        markets for U.S. agricultural products. He was more persuaded of the
                        desirability of such programs on humanitarian grounds, and agreed that they
                        afforded the best means of implementing <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss>
                        480.</p>
                    <p>He did not believe that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 programs
                        should be determined by their impact on the budget. He did believe, however,
                        that it would be possible to bring about some limited reduction in aid
                        programs by use of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480. For example, he
                        used the illustration that where there was an aid program of 100 units and a
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program of an additional 100
                        units could be initiated it should be possible to reduce the aid program by
                        about 20 units so as to have a total program of about 180 units. He agreed
                        that a stronger case for reduction in aid could be made over a period of
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> stated that he would be
                        unable to attend the <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> Council
                        meeting (November 8) and that Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> and Mr.

                    <p>The Agriculture Department has reopened the question of a cotton export
                        policy for the 1955–56 cotton marketing year ending July 31 and is proposing
                        a policy for a three-year period. A proposal <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                            facs="0192"/>by Agriculture will be discussed at the meeting of the

                        bid program for export of up to 4 million bales of cotton annually for each
                        of the next three years beginning January 1. The Agriculture proposal would
                        also call for measures, not specified in the proposal, to protect the
                        domestic textile industry from imports based on lower-priced cotton abroad
                        and to subsidize the raw cotton content of textile exports. Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> has said that the
                        Commodity Credit Corporation would administer the program in such a way as
                        not to depress the present world price of cotton seriously and that
                        Agriculture would envisage exports of only about 3 million bales rather than
                        the 4-million bale ceiling that would be announced. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> believes that unless the
                        Administration takes action to try to increase our cotton exports, Congress
                        will pass legislation, such as S. 2702, at its next session which will force
                        the Administration to subsidize our exports of cotton without much
                        discretion as to possible adverse effects on other countries.</p>

                        proposal, indicated positive and negative considerations regarding it, and

                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>In view of the previous criticism of the State Department with regard
                            to Agriculture’s surplus disposal operations, it is hoped that other
                            Council representatives will take the lead in commenting on the
                            Agriculture proposal. It is recommended, therefore, that you not take
                            the initiative in the discussion of the Agriculture proposal except as
                            you deem necessary.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>You might wish to point out that the Agriculture proposal does not get
                            to the heart of the problem with regard to a long term solution to the
                            cotton situation. Considering the disclaimers by Agriculture that the
                            program will not be administered in such a way as to seriously reduce
                            world cotton prices, it is questionable whether the 500,000 bales in
                            increased exports which might possibly result from the program is
                            warranted. The questioning of the Agriculture proposal on its merits is
                            enhanced by the many foreign relations difficulties which the Department
                            sees in the Agriculture proposal. <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163"
                                facs="0193"/>Furthermore, the Department does not agree that the
                            Agriculture proposal has any significant advantage to the Administration
                            over proposed Congressional legislation such as S.2702, which the
                            Secretary has opposed.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>If it is felt that some action must be taken by the Administration at
                            this time to assist Agriculture in the cotton export situation before
                            any fundamental change is made in the present price support program, it
                            is recommended that you suggest that the fourth alternative on page 4 of
                            Tab B be given serious consideration by the Council. This alternative
                            would allow export prices for all cotton held by <gloss target="#t_CCC1"
                                >CCC</gloss> to be reduced on January 1, 1956 to the extent of the
                            reduction in the domestic support prices which Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> will announce shortly for the
                            new cotton year beginning August 1, 1956. In supporting this alternative
                            you might wish to point out that this would permit treating domestic and
                            export price equally and perhaps provide some incentive to reduce
                            domestic support prices to the 75 per cent of parity permitted in the
                            law.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>The chief critics of the surplus agricultural disposal policies of the United
                        States have been Canada and Australia. Their criticism has been a matter of
                        basic unhappiness with the implications of the policy we have adopted of
                        selling goods on a competitive basis (i.e., subsidized), and has not been
                        directed at any particular feature of the program. The South Africans and
                        the New Zealanders have also been critical and apprehensive, the latter
                        particularly about butter. It is hard to say whether our disposal policies
                        and actions have evoked enough reaction from any of these commonwealth
                        governments to warrant the judgment that our political relations have been
                        impaired.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America the criticism has come from Uruguay, Argentina, and Peru.
                        Peru has benefited from our disposal policies by accepting shipments of
                        wheat, but has been critical of our sales of cotton. Argentina has benefited
                        by obtaining vegetable oil, but has been critical of our wheat sales.
                        Uruguay has not benefited from the program and has been consistently
                        critical. It is hard to see that our political relations have been impaired
                        in Latin America through the operation of the program, but they could
                        be.</p>
                    <p>Our European critics are led by Denmark and the Netherlands. The British have
                        expressed general doctrinal objections to our surplus disposal, and have
                        particularly disliked the 50/50 shipping clause. On this latter point they
                        are supported firmly by the Scandinavians. The Italians have benefited from
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, but have been critical of our
                        deals with Austria, Japan, and Greece. We have probably made few political
                        enemies in Europe, however, as the result of our disposal actions.</p>
                    <p>In Asia there has been considerable diversity of opinion, depending on the
                        country in question. Thailand and Burma have been very critical about our
                        rice disposals, and perhaps our political relations with Burma have

                        commodities.</p>
                    <p>In such multilateral forums as <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, our relations with other countries have
                        in general been damaged by the apprehension which other countries have over
                        what we might do under our disposal program, even though they recognize that
                        we have been moderate.</p>
                    <p>If we did not have enemies determined and able to exploit the unhappiness
                        caused by our disposal policies, we could adjust ourselves in individual
                        situations so as to minimize the harm done. We are, however, extremely
                        vulnerable to political attack encouraged by Communists, for example, for
                        wrecking the economies of Pakistan, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Egypt by
                        dumping cotton, and we are vulnerable to a comparable attack with respect to
                        the impact of our rice sales on Thailand and Burma. In a political sense,
                        the most important commodities from the standpoint of our foreign policy are
                        rice and cotton.</p>

                            Problems</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Burma:</hi></p>
                    <p>The most acute conflict between our foreign policy and foreign agricultural
                        disposal objectives is in Burma. The Burmese economy, which is almost
                        entirely dependent on rice for its existence, has been faced with large
                        unsalable surpluses of rice. The entire Communist bloc, acting in concert
                        during the last nine months, chose to exploit this situation by taking the
                        greatest part of Burmese surplus rice under so-called barter transactions.
                        The net result is that almost one third of the Burmese foreign exports are
                        now going to the Communist bloc and Burma is accordingly heavily susceptible
                        to Communist <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0196"/>pressures. The
                        substantial enhancement of Communist influence in Burma finally culminated
                        in the Bulganin–Krushchev talks. The Burmese have repeatedly and officially
                        requested the United States to desist from disposal of surplus wheat and
                        rice in their normal market area Asia and, right or wrong, <hi rend="italic"
                            >believe that it has been U.S. agricultural surplus disposal policy
                            which has forced them into the arms of the Communists</hi>. U Nu has
                        stated that he agreed to accept the most recent Communist offers only after
                        his appeal to the United States to buy some of Burma’s surplus agricultural
                        rice had been rejected.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Thailand:</hi></p>
                    <p>Thailand, like Burma, has had a large surplus of rice. The Thais have
                        succeeded in moving the greater part of the surplus to their normal
                        customers only through marked reduction in price. The Thais have made
                        representations to us to desist from disposing of U.S. surplus agricultural
                        products in the Far East and criticized the U.S. in international forums on
                        the grounds that the effect of U.S. policy is to deprive them of their
                        normal customers and to depress the price.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Indonesia:</hi></p>
                    <p>Indonesia has requested a very large agricultural surplus program involving
                        among other things wheat, dairy products and rice. To accommodate the
                        Indonesian’s desire would antagonize the Australians on wheat, the Dutch on
                        dairy products and the Burmese and Thais on rice. The Indonesians and the
                        Department of Agriculture are talking about a total of 250,000 tons of rice
                        under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 to Indonesia.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Philippines:</hi></p>
                    <p>Rice is the sorest point in the Philippines, since the Burmese and the Thais
                        look on the Philippines as an Asian market. A rice purchasing mission was in
                        Burma from the Philippines and returned home as soon as it became known they
                        could obtain rice under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480. Secondarily,
                        inclusion of a substantial amount of tobacco in a <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 agreement has engendered some friction, since it is
                        regarded as conflicting with the interests of the small tobacco growers of
                        Luzon.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Korea:</hi></p>
                    <p>The Department of Agriculture has been insisting that if we supply Korea with
                        foodstuffs under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 we must require a
                        pledge from them not to export rice. From the standpoint of our objectives
                        in Korea, that country must export rice if it ever is to approach a viable
                        economy.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Japan:</hi></p>
                    <p>Japan wants to buy rice from Burma and Thailand in an effort to extend her
                        relations in Southeast Asia and create new markets. To the extent we insist
                        on high usual marketings in addition to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                        480 transactions, we are indirectly blocking the development of new Japanese

                        unfortunate at this time when the Administration is reviewing the overall
                        cotton problem and we are trying to develop more favorable relations with
                        Egypt. It would also adversely affect our relations with Peru.</p>
                    <p>We have been striving to build up good will with Egypt in an effort to
                        counteract Soviet pressures in the area, to influence the settling of the
                        Arab-Israel dispute, and in view of Egypt’s position of leadership among the
                        Arab States. Our efforts would be gravely prejudiced by action to restrict
                        imports of their cotton.</p>
                    <p>If we restrict the ability of Egypt to sell cotton here, it will increase the
                        need for Egypt to sell elsewhere. Cotton represents 85 per cent of Egypt’s
                        exports and is its major dollar earner. Egypt exports about $16 million of
                        cotton to the U.S. annually, half of which would be lost under the
                        Agriculture proposal. Egypt has increased its cotton exports to the Soviet
                        Bloc recently because its traditional free world markets have reduced their
                        cotton imports. We believe, therefore, that the proposed action would
                        markedly increase the orientation of Egypt toward the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0198"/>
                    <p>The importance of Egypt, in relation to mid-eastern oil, and Africa, needs, I
                        think, no elaboration here.</p>
                    <p>Peru has been concerned for years over the fact that her two principal
                        exports, cotton and sugar, are subject to quota limitations upon entry into
                        the U.S. Peru exports considerably less to the U.S. than it imports from us
                        and attributes this “unfavorable” balance to our restrictive trade
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Any action which the Administration takes on long staple cotton should be
                        considered within the framework of the overall cotton problem. I understand
                        that the proposal might reduce <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> outlays
                        by about $12 million as compared with the $1.5 billion of upland cotton in
                            <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>’s hands. I should hope that the long
                        staple cotton problem could be solved in a different direction.</p>

                        he was very strong for the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> legislation
                        and that he felt it was very much in the interest of the country to get it
                        on the books. On the other hand, he wanted the President to know that the
                        situation is tougher than it was when the House passed H. R. 1 by seven
                        votes. At that time approximately two thirds of the Republicans and
                        one-third of the Democrats voted against passage of this legislation
                        (H.R.1). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that he would not be able to hold two thirds of the Democrats on the
                            <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> bill; consequently, it was necessary
                        to get more than one third of the Republicans. He reported that Mr.

                            <persName>McCormack</persName> agreed with him that the Democrats <pb

                            >OTC</gloss> a good majority but that they could not hold as many as two
                        thirds on their side of the aisle.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> reported that he felt that
                        he could report the bill from his Committee by a good majority but pointed
                        out that H.R. 1 was reported out by a vote of twenty to five and still had
                        extremely difficult sledding on the Floor of the House and that in his
                        opinion <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> would have even more difficulty
                        on the Floor of the House. He pointed out that the situation had been made
                        worse by the drive of the textile and oil people against the proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> expressed his grave concern
                        about the possible effect on the world situation of beginning efforts to
                        pass <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> and failing in these efforts. He
                        indicated that, in his opinion, it was a very high policy decision which
                        must be made only by the President. The President replied that he had given
                        this matter careful consideration and had concluded that we should go ahead
                        and make every effort to enact <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> into law
                        even though our efforts might result in failure. He stated that he thought
                        our position before the world under these circumstances would be better than
                        the circumstances of not having made an effort.</p>
                    <p>The President brought up the <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>

                        out that in the matter of tariffs many of the members of the House had been
                        “protectionists” for years and that it was extremely difficult to get them
                        to look at the logic of a situation when the matter of tariffs came up.</p>
                    <p>Then ensued a discussion of the handling of the Hearings. The President
                        stated that it was his opinion that if comprehensive hearings were held the
                        facts brought out by the hearings should have a material influence on the
                        Floor action. The President further advised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1"
                            >Cooper</persName> that he personally would do everything that he could
                        do, consistent with his position, to further the acceptance of the proposed
                        legislation.</p>

                            of Proposed Cotton Export Program</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>As pointed out in our meeting this morning, it is important to differentiate
                        import-protective measures for the domestic textile industry according to
                        (a) remedial measures that may be taken against injury from textile imports,
                        even without an expanded subsidy program for raw cotton exports, and (b)
                        remedial measures addressed specifically to offsetting any adverse effects
                        on the domestic textile industry that may result from an expanded subsidy
                        program for cotton exports.</p>
                    <p>As to the first point above, we have had extended discussions with
                        representatives of the textile industry regarding the course available in
                        legislation for seeking remedial action. We are also considering further
                        with Agriculture and Commerce the proposal made in our meeting this morning
                        that we seek official confirmation from the Japanese Government of the
                        levels of restrictions voluntarily applied to various types of Japanese
                        textiles exported to the United States, and the period during which these
                        restrictions will be in effect.</p>
                    <p>As to the second point above, it is hoped that an expanded subsidy program
                        for cotton exports will not necessitate the use of any additional protective
                        measures for the domestic textile industry. But if such an export program
                        does result in a wide differential in American cotton prices here and
                        abroad, it may be necessary, in fairness to the domestic textile industry,
                        to arrange a system of offsetting fees on textile imports and exports. The
                        Executive Branch has adequate legislative authority to make such
                        arrangements. If the proposed cotton export program is approved, I suggest
                        that the Administration might give consideration to informing the domestic
                        textile industry that the Executive Branch intends to apply these offsetting
                        arrangements if necessary. This would eliminate the cotton export program as
                        an additional reason that might otherwise be advanced by the domestic
                        textile industry for protection against imports.</p>

                    <p>If needed as a consequence of the proposed cotton export program, legislative
                        authority exists for offsetting compensation to the domestic textile
                        industry in the form of (a) cash subsidies or subsidized raw cotton for
                        textile exports, and (b) offsetting fees for relatively low-priced raw
                        cotton in imported textiles. The legislative authority for such actions is
                        described below.</p>

                                that the Secretary of Agriculture paid a subsidy to exporters of
                                cotton textiles in 1939 and 1940, in an amount equal, on a raw
                                cotton content basis, to the subsidy on raw cotton then in

                            <p>Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act authorizes the
                                President to restrict by quotas or fees the importation of any
                                agricultural commodity or product thereof when it is determined,
                                following investigation, that imports are materially interfering
                                with Department of Agriculture programs or operations.</p>
                            <p>It is assumed that an export subsidy program on raw cotton would be a
                                Department of Agriculture program under this Section and therefore
                                could provide the basis for import quotas or fees in order to
                                prevent imported textiles from materially interfering with the
                                export subsidy program. Since such a program would entail sales of
                                cotton on a subsidized basis of X cents per pound, it would be
                                possible to offset the lower raw cotton costs in imported textiles
                                through a fee on the raw cotton content of imported textiles equal
                                to the amount of the subsidy for raw cotton. Quota limitations would
                                be unnecessary and undesirable for this purpose.</p></item>

                    <p>There follows a summary of the discussion at the meeting and the main points
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of agenda items 1–4, “A Net Evaluation
                        Subcommittee,” “Significant World Developments Affecting U.S. Security,”
                        “U.S. Policy Toward Austria,” and “U.S. Policy on Indonesia.”]</p>

                            Between the Free World and the Soviet Bloc</hi></p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion pertaining to East-West trade.] At this point
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> once again inquired
                        about the fate of his proposal that we offer the Czechs a large amount of
                        our surplus agricultural commodities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> replied that this suggestion had not been ignored, but
                        had been considered by the Operations Coordinating Board at a recent
                        meeting. At the time of this consideration the Attorney General had provided
                        an opinion <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0205"/>that it would be
                        contrary to the provisions of Public Law 480 for the United States to
                        dispose of agricultural surpluses behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>The President then adverted to the fact that many of the restrictive laws on
                        trade with the Soviet bloc countries had been passed when the country was in
                        a state of hysteria and when the McCarthy problem was at its height. Now
                        that this hysteria had lessened, the President wondered if it would not be
                        sensible to take a fresh look at the wisdom of this restrictive legislation.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he would
                        confine himself to pointing out that it was “ridiculous” for the United
                        States to have a vast pile of economic ammunition, in the shape of surplus
                        food and agricultural products, which we could use against the Soviets but
                        which in fact all we are doing is sitting on. The President expressed
                        emphatic agreement with this observation, and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to point out that the
                        Soviets raise hell with us by their purchase of surpluses from the
                        underdeveloped countries. Why could we not raise hell with the Soviets by
                        offering to dispose of some of our surpluses within the Soviet bloc?</p>
                    <p>The President then referred once again to his favorite project of making West
                        Berlin a showcase by sending to it a lot of our surplus food, so that the
                        West Berliners would be the sleekest and best-fed people in Europe. The
                        President recalled that somewhere or other he had had a report on this
                        subject, and the report had said that the West Berliners were already very
                        adequately fed.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> speculated as to whether
                        the time had not come to revive one of the President’s favorite ideas,
                        namely, that the United States should get itself in the position of being
                        able to barter its agricultural surpluses behind the Iron Curtain in return
                        for strategic materials. At the moment, of course, we were completely
                        blocked from this course of action by the provisions in Public Law 480.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was inclined to doubt
                        whether the Soviets would barter strategic materials in return for our
                        surplus agricultural products. Admiral Radford warned that if we thus
                        developed trade with the Soviet bloc nations, our allies could well ask us
                        why we were attempting to keep down their own trade with the Soviet
                        bloc.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in any case he was convinced that the Administration
                        had been much too concerned with what Congress thought about the problem of
                        trade with the Soviet bloc. After all, Congress was primarily moved by
                        political considerations. There was need, therefore, for a new look at the
                        problem of East-West trade generally.</p>
                    <p>The Executive Secretary suggested that the President might wish to ask the
                        Operations Coordinating Board for a report as to existing <pb n="176"
                            xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>legal authority for the United States to
                        trade with Iron Curtain countries and to dispose of agricultural surpluses
                        in these countries. The President replied that he wanted this subject dealt
                        with in the reports from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> scheduled now for the
                        Council meeting on April 19. He wanted all of this put together in one
                        package, together with charts and maps.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the wish
                        that the Attorney General review his opinion (referred to earlier) as to the
                        legal authority of the United States to sell or trade its surpluses behind
                        the Iron Curtain.</p>

                            Act<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">This legislation, passed by the South
                            Carolina House of Representatives on March 6, 1956 and approved by
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_TGBJ1">Timmerman</persName> on March 8,
                            required that retail stores selling Japanese goods display the sign
                            “Japanese textiles sold here.”</note> which has recently become law in
                        your State. I feel confident that you will be interested in the effect which
                        this act and the concurrent resolution requesting the enactment of similar
                        legislation in other States may have upon our relations with Japan and other
                        friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>A basic long-term policy objective of the United States in the Far East is
                        the development of an economically sound, politically stable and friendly
                        Japan. The United States has consistently recognized that the economic
                        strength which we desire for Japan requires a high level of foreign trade.
                        In this connection the United States has encouraged the acceptance of Japan
                        into the world trading community. Our interest in Japan’s economic strength,
                        however, is not solely in terms of stability in the Far East. Japan is the
                        principal market for United States raw cotton. In 1955 Japan imported
                        647,000 bales of raw cotton from the United States, or 26% of our total raw
                        cotton exports. Japan’s willingness to buy United States cotton could be
                        affected by legislation such as that enacted by South Carolina.</p>
                    <p>The legislation also appears to run counter to the Treaty of Friendship,
                        Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan, which received
                        the advice and consent to ratification of the United States Senate on July
                        3, 1953.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">The treaty entered into force October
                            30, 1953; for text, see 4 UST (pt. 2) 2063.</note> Article XVI of this
                        Treaty requires each party to grant to the goods imported from the other, in
                        respect to all measures affecting internal distribution and sale as well as
                        to internal taxation, most-favored-nation treatment and treatment no less
                        favorable than that accorded to like domestic products. (Enclosed is a copy
                        of Article XVI and of Article XXII;<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Not
                            printed.</note> the latter defines “national treatment” and
                        “most-favored-nation treatment”.) The effect of the South Carolina law will
                        be to provide less favorable treatment to Japanese textiles than to those of
                        other foreign countries and of domestic manufacture.</p>
                    <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0208"/>
                    <p>In this connection the Japanese Government has made formal representation
                        that it considers the South Carolina law to discriminate against the sale of
                        Japanese textile goods and, therefore, to be in contravention of the Treaty
                        of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. The Japanese in their representation
                        also pointed to the fact that their government and the Japanese textile
                        industries voluntarily restricted the export of cotton goods to the United
                        States in January 1956. This action, which involved difficulties for an
                        important segment of the Japanese economy, was taken in an effort to meet
                        the problem which the United States cotton textile industry claimed such
                        exports created for it. The Japanese Government and press have expressed
                        grave concern over the implications of this legislation and the adverse
                        effects which it might have on the friendly relations between the two
                        countries.</p>

                    <p>To determine the position the Executive Branch should take regarding
                        assistance to the cotton textile industry in meeting international
                        competition.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Background</hi></p>
                    <p>Sharply rising imports of cotton cloth and other cotton products from Japan
                        have precipitated demands by the U.S. textile industry, addressed both to
                        the Executive Branch and to the Congress, for import quotas on cotton
                        textiles. The industry’s concern has been heightened by the new cotton
                        export program and the prospect of a further increase in the spread in the
                        price of U.S. produced cotton in domestic and world markets.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. textile industry—with the support of the National Cotton Council
                        representing the growers and handlers of raw cotton—contends that the
                        increased imports constitute a serious menace to its own welfare and also to
                        the domestic market for raw cotton.</p>
                    <p>The main arguments are: (1) Japanese textile producers can purchase raw
                        cotton at lower prices than the U.S. industry; (2) labor costs in Japan are
                        far below those in the United States; (3) the Japanese textile industry has
                        been extensively modernized since the war; (4) <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> concessions made to Japan, effective September 1955, have
                        stimulated an additional flood of Japanese textiles into the United
                        States.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>For the cotton textile industry as a whole (with the possible
                            exception of certain segments) the available evidence does not support
                            the contention at this time that increased imports have contributed
                            substantially towards causing (or threatening) serious injury to the
                            industry. It does not appear that action by the Government with respect
                            to imports would materially affect existing basic problems of the
                            industry such as (a) intense internal competition resulting from
                            overcapacity; (b) competition at home and abroad from man-made fibers;
                            (c) uncertainties in the price of raw material; (d) the build-up of
                            textile industries in areas that were formerly important markets for
                            U.S. textile exports; and (e) competition at consumer levels with hard
                            goods. Nor does it appear that action by the Government on imports would
                            significantly alter the fact that the rate of earnings of the textile
                            industry is below the average for all manufacturing industry. This
                            profit record is part of a long term decline in textile earnings which
                            began in 1907 and has been reversed only in the two World War periods.
                            For the cotton textile industry the interwar period of the 1920’s and
                            1930’s was characterized by low average earnings, frequent losses and a
                            reduction of capitalization. In the 17 years between 1939 and 1956 the
                            rate of earnings in textile mill products lagged well behind the average
                            in all but four years.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The new cotton export program will result in an increase in the
                            differential between domestic and export prices of U.S. raw cotton. In
                            the interest of equity, it may be appropriate to extend to the cotton
                            textile industry the same benefits that foreign users of U.S. cotton may
                            derive from the program. It would be possible under existing legislative
                            authority to provide such benefits to the domestic textile industry.

                            domestically supported prices is a major element in giving foreign mills
                            a competitive advantage over U.S. mills with respect to raw material
                            costs. If in the long run the domestic price support program could be
                            adjusted to eliminate the differential between domestic and world cotton
                            prices, one primary reason for the textile industry’s demands for
                            protection would be removed and the competitive position of cotton
                            vis-à-vis man-made fibers would be improved.</item>

                            promptly as is practicable consistent with the requirements of the law
                            and of sound governmental procedure. The affected industries should be
                            fully informed as to Tariff Commission procedures and urged to cooperate
                            by furnishing the necessary information to the Commission at the
                            earliest possible time.</item>

                        <item>The concern of the domestic textile industry that the present
                            unilateral Japanese restrictions on exports to the United States do not
                            provide real assurance against increased exports could be dissipated, or
                            at least reduced, by an exchange of letters between the Japanese Foreign
                            Minister and the Secretary of State. Such voluntary limits by the
                            Japanese Government on exports to the United States can provide a
                            reasonable degree of stability to the import picture against which
                            domestic textile producers can plan their own operations. Formal
                            agreements on a government-to-government or industry-to-industry basis
                            involve legal and commercial policy problems that rule against their use

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> made reference to the
                        adverse opinion offered recently by the Attorney General in connection with
                        the disposal of agricultural surpluses to Iron Curtain countries. He also
                        pointed out that the President had recommended, in his farm message to
                        Congress, that the latter repeal the sections of Public Law 480 which
                        prevented the United States from trading its agricultural surpluses to Iron
                        Curtain countries. The Congress had failed to act on the President’s
                        recommendation.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General said that upon receipt of the Council’s request pursuant
                        to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1536–b, he had checked
                        with the General Counsels of the Departments of Defense, Treasury, and other
                        responsible agencies. No response had come from the State Department, but
                        none of the other departments had been able to perceive any way by which the
                        Attorney General’s adverse opinion on the possibility of legally trading our
                        agricultural surpluses behind the Iron Curtain, could be changed. On the
                        other hand, Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> in the State Department
                        believed that there was one means of avoiding this restriction on trade in
                        agricultural surpluses without having recourse to new legislation. Mr.
                            <persName>Prochnow</persName> had suggested that it would be legal to
                        sell our agricultural surpluses to the Soviet bloc in return for dollars,
                        buying with these dollars strategic materials from the Soviet bloc
                        countries. The Department of Justice did not agree with Mr.
                            <persName>Prochnow</persName> on the feasibility of this course of
                        action.</p>
                    <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0214"/>
                    <p>Speaking with great warmth, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> deplored the fact that the United States Government
                        was so bound up with red tape that it was now unable to seize and exploit an
                        unique opportunity from the point of view of U.S. foreign policy objectives.
                        The situation in the satellites, he said, was probably more precarious than
                        it had been in a very long time, as a result of the de-Stalinization
                        campaign and other matters just mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Allen Dulles</persName>. If we were now in a position to make up an
                        attractive shopping list and present such a list, for example, to the
                        Czechs, this would raise absolute hell in the Soviet bloc. What would the
                        Soviets have to do in response to such an initiative? They would probably be
                        obliged to try to match the U.S. offer. It was unlikely that they would
                        permit a satellite to accept such a U.S. offer. They had not permitted this
                        in the case of the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Marshall</persName> Plan.
                        Nevertheless, such a refusal would strain to the utmost relations between
                        the USSR and its satellites. Indeed, it might even produce a complete
                        collapse of the satellite relationship. In point of fact, therefore, we have
                        been presented with a magnificent cold war opportunity and we are unable, as
                        a government, to find a way to capitalize on the opportunity. It might be
                        necessary to seek legislation. This problem had never really been understood
                        by the Congress. In any event, some way must be found to make use of these
                        vast U.S. surpluses in the interests of our national security.</p>
                    <p>The President smiled and said that it was extremely encouraging to him to
                        have someone else make his speech for him. Referring to the restrictions in
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 as “damned foolishness”, the
                        President indicated that he believed we should go to the Congress for
                        legislation if this were necessary. In so doing the President speculated
                        whether we could not deal initially with the problem in the Foreign Affairs
                        Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, rather than the Agriculture
                        Committee. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented
                        that this was a fine idea if it proved feasible, although the Agriculture
                        Committee would be jealous of its prerogatives. Both the Attorney General
                        and General <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName> thought the
                        President’s suggestion well worth a trial.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that such new legislation would, of course, normally
                        be referred to the Agriculture Committee, but if enough matter dealing with
                        foreign policy were included in the resolution or the legislation, a
                        diversion might be made to the Foreign Affairs Committees.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> turned to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and asked him what he had
                        in mind that the United States would buy from the satellite countries in
                        return for the agricultural surpluses we sold to them. Secretary <persName

                        matter much thought, and didn’t believe it to be very important. Secretary
                            <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0215"/><persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> replied that he thought the matter of great
                        importance from the point of view of getting Congressional approval of the
                        proposal suggested by the Secretary of State for disposing of our
                        agricultural surpluses behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President pointed out that in the first instance what we would be
                        seeking from the Congress was authority to make an offer of surplus
                        agricultural materials to the Iron Curtain countries. Once this was obtained
                        there would be the problem of determining what we would buy from them with
                        the dollars we received for the agricultural commodities. This would
                        undoubtedly be a problem with those members of Congress and others who
                        dreaded competition from abroad.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> stated that he assumed
                        that all around the table knew that the so-called “Fountain Committee” was
                        currently investigating reports which were getting around to the effect that
                        large amounts of our surplus agricultural commodities were actually reaching
                        Iron Curtain countries through the agency of certain Western European
                        countries. We in Commerce, he said, believe that it would be highly
                        desirable that we have authority to sell such commodities rather than have
                        them reach the Iron Curtain countries through these devious channels. Time,
                        added Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>, was of the
                        essence, because we would soon be hearing screams from the Fountain
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that it was his belief that we have got to work up a
                        resolution and get it before the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations
                        Committees, stressing the fact that what we were doing was strictly in the
                        context of achieving our foreign policy objectives. The Attorney General
                        agreed, and suggested that such a resolution might be so phrased as to
                        suggest an emergency basis with a duration of only a year or two. The
                        President went on to say that in any case the resolution must be made to
                        appear in the right light before the Congress. We must make clear that we
                        were simply dangling some carrots before the satellite governments in order
                        to increase the strength of their pull away from the USSR. As he had often
                        said before, the President reiterated his belief that trade was the greatest
                        weapon in the hands of the diplomat. On the other hand, the President did
                        express agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> that we should give some thought to what we would
                        buy from the satellites in return for the agricultural commodities we sold
                        them. The President speculated that we might conceivably buy arms from
                        Czechoslovakia, which we could then proceed to give to our needy friends and
                        allies.</p>

                    <p>As you know, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John Leddy</persName> has charge
                        in the E Area of handling all <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> matters.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> prepared a comprehensive
                        and thorough program for the advancement of this legislation and has pursued
                        it aggressively. There have been many comments that the presentation by the
                        Administration has been exceptionally good. We <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187"
                            facs="0217"/>are getting strong press support. We expect to continue in

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> Staff has also analyzed the question of
                        what course to pursue if it became a serious question of whether the

                        Staff, as well as the position recommended by the Staff, is found in the
                        attached memorandum from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBH1"
                            >Thibodeaux</persName>.</p>

                        <head><gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> LEGISLATION</head>
                        <p>You have asked whether, if an analysis of Congressional opinion is
                            unfavorable to <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>, it would be wiser to
                            hold it up this session in the hope of obtaining passage of the
                            legislation next year. For the following reasons I believe that delay
                            would mean just as certain defeat as a prospective adverse vote in this
                            session of the Congress.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that we can again mobilize public support for <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> next year. That support is strong now
                            and is reflected in public opinion polls. Much of this favorable
                            sentiment has been developed by public groups who have worked hard on
                            the basis of assurances that the Administration would carry through. We
                            also have a favorable vote from Ways and Means (18 to 7) and a strong
                            committee report. If <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is delayed the
                            whole hearing procedure would have to be repeated, and probably without
                            as favorable a result. I believe, therefore, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> project could not survive a
                            postponement.</p>
                        <p>Since the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> has already been deferred
                            for a year (it was first introduced in 1955) I believe that both foreign
                            governments and domestic supporters would consider another delay, with
                            the acquiescence of the President, as a euphemism for defeat. An
                            important part of the strategy of the opposition has been to cast doubt
                            on the firmness of the President’s intentions despite his strong
                            statements favoring <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. If the
                            President now backs down, he will in effect be conceding the opposition
                            case and open the Administration to an even wider and more intense
                            attack, not only on U.S. participation in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> but on the Administration’s trade program generally.
                            That this is the opposition strategy is evident from several bills
                            already introduced which are designed to sweep away the entire framework
                            of our trade agreements program.</p>
                        <p>On balance, I think we would not be as badly off, internationally, if the
                                <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> were defeated in Congress than
                            if it were postponed with the consent of the Administration. The <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> was negotiated on <pb n="188"
                                xml:id="pg_188" facs="0218"/>the initiative of the United States,
                            and foreign governments agreed to this negotiation on the assumption
                            that the Administration would press for its adoption. They would view
                            deferral as an Administration decision to reject. An adverse
                            Congressional vote would at least allow us to work with other
                            governments in improving the administration of the General Agreement on
                            Tariffs and Trade on the assumption of no <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                                >OTC</gloss>. If <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is deferred,
                            this will paralyze any forward movement for a considerable period.
                            Finally, there are certain substantive amendments to the General
                            Agreement, designed to speed up removal of restrictions of American
                            goods, that other governments have not yet ratified pending action on
                                <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. If <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                                >OTC</gloss> were definitely out of the way (even though rejected)
                            we could press for getting these amendments into force.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>This section, if enacted into law, could seriously injure the economies of
                        Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Pakistan, Peru, Egypt and other countries, and hence
                        would jeopardize our relations with them.</p>
                    <p>Section 203 would require the sale of upland cotton in world markets at
                        prices no higher than those offered by other exporting countries for
                        comparable quality. In no event could prices be higher than they had been
                        under the one-million bale program completed earlier this year.</p>
                    <p>The stated objective is to re-gain a fair share of the world cotton market.
                        The result, however, would almost surely be a progressive and severe decline
                        in world prices for cotton. Other exporting countries are unable to hold
                        stocks. They would be obliged to dispose of their current production at
                        almost any price. The United States would be required by law to follow
                        prices downward.</p>
                    <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0219"/>
                    <p>The U.S.S.R. exports only a small amount of cotton which ordinarily does not
                        affect world market prices. Section 203, however, would create a situation
                        in which the U.S.S.R. could determine the world price. Small lots of Russian
                        cotton sold at price reductions in Liverpool, for example, could force the
                        United States to meet the Russian price. Other countries perforce would have
                        to follow the United States lead. Thus the cotton exporting countries of the
                        free world would be at the mercy of the Communists. Their resentment,
                        however, with considerable logic, could be directed toward the United States
                        policy of meeting every reduction in price, as specified in the proposed
                        bill.</p>
                    <p>Any attempt by other countries to escape the downward spiral by resorting to
                        bilateral agreements, conducted without regard to market prices, would set
                        back our hopes for a multilateral trading system—the only system which
                        offers increasing opportunities for private trade and the exporting of a
                        wide range of United States products.</p>
                    <p>This section would make the prices under the one-million bale program a
                        ceiling, even though substantial quantities of United States cotton are
                        already being sold for export on a bid basis at considerably higher prices
                        under the present program. Some 224,000 bales have been sold on bids
                        received last week at prices several cents per pound higher than the ceiling
                        which this section would arbitrarily impose.</p>
                    <p>The new farm bill is encumbered with other provisions which are objectionable
                        from a foreign relations standpoint. Notable among these is Section 202,
                        which would further restrict our import quota on extra-long staple cotton
                        and subsidize the export of such cotton—a type which the United States does
                        not normally export. Peru particularly would be hurt by this provision, with
                        the probability of wide repercussions in other parts of Latin America.</p>
                    <p>In view of the circumstances I have outlined above, the Department of State
                        has no other recourse than to vigorously protest against Sections 202 and
                            203.<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                    <p>I talked to <persName>Joe Martin</persName> about the foreign aid program and
                        the chances of enacting the bill on <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>
                        (Organization for Trade Cooperation).</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the difficulties the foreign aid bill was having
                        in Congress.]</p>
                    <p>However, I asked Joe to come in to see me primarily because of my concern as
                        to the general attitude toward <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. There is
                        a very great deal of misunderstanding concerning <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                            >OTC</gloss>. Attached is a memorandum that shows what <gloss
                            target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Not printed.
                            Two papers attached were entitled “Important Facts on <gloss
                                target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>” and “The Truth about the Organization
                            for Trade Cooperation (H.R. 5550).”</note></p>
                    <p>Joe understands this, as do the other Congressional leaders. However, since
                        the popular concept is that <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is a device
                        for lowering tariffs, the project is disliked in manufacturing districts
                        such as Joe’s. Consequently, he himself is very lukewarm.</p>
                    <p>I insisted that there be a conference called of Republican Congressmen
                        (immediately after action on the foreign aid bill is completed) to make
                        certain that each of them understands exactly what <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                            >OTC</gloss> is. Moreover, I insisted that each understand how intensely
                        interested I am in having it favorably considered. I pointed out to Joe that
                        many of these people would, this coming fall, be asking for my blessing in
                        races for reelection. I told him that, as always, I would stand for
                        principles and important measures, and of the measures I would insisted was
                        needed by our country was this <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>. [<hi
                            rend="italic">sic</hi>] This would create a very difficult situation if
                        we found a majority of House Republicans opposing me on this point; any
                        request of mine under these circumstances for a Republican House would be
                        greeted with a considerable amount of justifiable ridicule.</p>
                    <p>I think that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJW1">Martin</persName> got the point;
                        he promised faithfully to get the group together and allow any Congressman
                        to present the case to the Congress whom I might consider capable of doing
                        well.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_HBN1">Bryce Harlow</persName> to keep in touch
                        with the matter, and expressed the opinion that Charlie Halleck would
                        probably do the best job of anyone.</p>

                                there was strong opposition and he doubted very much if it would be

                            411.006/6–2756)</note> In that letter the Department <pb n="193"
                            xml:id="pg_193" facs="0223"/>said that the escape clause investigation
                        with regard to cotton textiles proposed in the resolution was in accord with
                        the position which the Department had taken in discussions with
                        representatives of the textile industry, although an investigation of the
                        scope called for in <gloss target="#t_SRes1">S. Res.</gloss> 236 might
                        create a number of practical difficulties.</p>
                    <p>In view of the concern which the textile industry has expressed regarding
                        imports of cotton textiles, it may be of interest to the Committee to be
                        informed of the consideration the Administration has given to this question
                        and of the actions that have been taken.</p>
                    <p>Top policy-level officers of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and
                        State and members of the White House staff have met repeatedly with
                        representatives of the domestic textile industry and with residents of
                        textile-mill areas. These meetings have been most useful in that they have
                        served to inform the Administration of the views of the domestic industry
                        and have provided the latter with an opportunity to learn at first-hand what
                        the Administration has done and is doing with regard to this question.</p>
                    <p>The Administration has discussed the question of textile imports with the
                        Japanese Government, both in Washington and through the American Embassy in
                        Tokyo. The importance of diversifying their exports so as not to concentrate
                        on a limited number of items which might result in injury to an American
                        industry has been discussed fully with representatives of the Japanese
                        Government. Despite a multitude of serious problems associated with
                        restrictions on exports from Japan, the Japanese Government instituted
                        voluntary controls on cotton textile exports to the United States. On May
                        16, 1956 the Japanese Government officially informed this Government of its
                        restrictions on exports of textiles to the United States during 1956 and of
                        its intention to adopt similar measures for 1957. Japan has stated that it
                        will give at least three months’ advance notice if for any reason it might
                        change its export quotas. I am enclosing a copy of the exchange of
                            notes<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">Not printed.</note> with the Japanese
                        Government on this question which the Committee may wish to include in its
                        record.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese quota for 1956 is limited on an over-all basis to less than 1.5
                        percent of the United States production in 1955 of cotton textiles and
                        provides for restrictions on the export of specific types of textiles to
                        assure substantially increased diversification. The over-all quota is 150
                        million square yards of cotton cloth. Within this quota print cloth exports
                        are limited to 20 million square yards and velveteens to 5 million square
                        yards. A further sub-quota on ginghams is under consideration.</p>
                    <p>A separate quota of 2.5 million dozen ladies’ blouses was also established
                        voluntarily by the Japanese Government. This quota was <pb n="194"
                            xml:id="pg_194" facs="0224"/>reduced only recently to 1.5 million dozen
                        blouses for the twelve months ending March 31, 1957. The American blouse
                        manufacturing industry considers that this action removes the threat of
                        serious injury posed by blouse imports, and has withdrawn its request for an
                        escape clause investigation. The request to stop the investigation was
                        approved by the Tariff Commission on June 22.</p>
                    <p>Another important step of significant help to the domestic textile industry
                        is the cotton products export program, now under preparation by the
                        Department of Agriculture. This program, to be announced before August 1, is
                        designed to make our cotton textiles more competitive in world markets by
                        giving our textile exporters a price advantage equivalent to that which
                        foreign mills enjoy in purchasing cotton under the new raw cotton export
                        program.</p>
                    <p>These are steps which the Administration has taken and is taking. By no means
                        has the Administration taken the position that these constitute the limit of
                        remedy when and where remedy is needed. Other opportunities may well present
                        themselves to provide further implementation of a basic Administration
                        policy, stated by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                            read the letter in the House of Representatives the following day. For
                            text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 7,
                            1955, p. 388.</note> and followed by every Executive agency concerned,
                        that no domestic industry will be placed in jeopardy by the trade agreements
                        program.</p>
                    <p>However, actions which are taken in connection with the textile import
                        question must not be self-defeating nor must they give rise to new problems
                        more serious than the ones which they try to solve.</p>
                    <p>In this connection action by the Congress to establish import quotas on
                        textiles would create many problems. Such quotas, instituted without regard
                        to the well-established and internationally-accepted escape clause
                        procedure, would ignore the legitimate interests of all parts of our
                        economy: producers, importers and exporters, and consumers. The escape
                        clause procedure makes it possible for individual segments of an industry to
                        receive protection against serious injury or the threat of such injury as a
                        result of imports. It provides for an investigation of the facts and for
                        public hearings by the Tariff Commission as in the case of the three
                        segments of the cotton textile industry which have already applied under the
                        escape clause: velveteens, pillowcases, and ginghams. Experience has shown
                        that factors other than imports are frequently the cause of an industry’s
                        difficulties. That is why the escape clause procedure, open to all, provides
                        such a useful way in which to ascertain the facts.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0225"/>
                    <p>Quotas by legislation would hurt the textile industry itself. The United
                        States exports by value twice as much cotton textiles as it imports. On a
                        yardage basis our cotton cloth exports in 1955 were four times as large as
                        our cotton cloth imports. If we restrict our imports we also restrict the
                        ability of countries to pay for our exports and we provide an excuse for
                        other governments to take reciprocal restrictive action against our exports.
                        Thus, the price which the textile industry might pay for action by the
                        Congress to limit imports could be a loss of export business of great
                        significance to the industry.</p>
                    <p>A further problem associated with legislative import quotas is that it
                        provides an open invitation to many other industries to request similar
                        restrictive action. If a precedent of legislative import quotas were
                        established, the Congress would be faced with the conflicting demands of
                        various segments of American industry. Government controls have a tendency
                        to expand and import quotas once established by Congressional action may
                        well lead to ever-widening government controls over the operation of our
                        free enterprise economy.</p>
                    <p>In a narrower sense, but of almost equal importance is that complex problem
                        which the administration of import quotas poses. It requires, among other
                        things, regulations, government forms and enforcement. It will mean more
                        government with increased personnel and increased expenditures.</p>
                    <p>It would also be most unfortunate if the Congress were to require the
                        automatic imposition of import quotas prior to a Tariff Commission
                        investigation. Such an action would put into motion all of the disruptive
                        effects on our foreign trade and on the business community described above.
                        It could not fail to weaken the sound procedures already prescribed in our
                        present legislation.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing considerations indicate that the Administration is actively
                        concerned with the question of textile import competition. It has taken
                        significant steps to ameliorate the difficulties which may exist for certain
                        segments of the textile industry, and it supports the escape clause
                        procedures of the Trade Agreements Act as a fair course to seek remedial
                        action against injurious imports. The Administration is vigorously
                        continuing in its efforts to assist the textile industry, but it believes
                        that import quotas by act of Congress cannot solve and may actually add to
                        the difficulties of the textile industry.</p>

                        letter. Officials of these Departments and of the <pb n="196"

                        the pessimism seems justified. In any case its object was to provoke
                        discussion and reaction, and therefore it is more important to address
                        oneself to the issues raised rather than to the form in which they are

                            <item>As regards tariffs, it is clear that we cannot look forward to
                                much further progress in the near future. The United States has
                                negotiated more or less all that it can under the present Reciprocal
                                Trade Agreements Act. If, as we hope, there is a progressive
                                relaxation of quantitative restrictions in other countries, it is
                                unlikely that there will be much enthusiasm in the immediate future
                                for further tariff reduction in these countries. Moreover, the
                                possibilities are severely limited by the dissatisfaction of the low
                                tariff countries with the procedures under which tariff negotiations
                                take place. One consequence of this is that the centre of interest
                                in the tariff question has shifted to Paris. We must, therefore,
                                assume that there is not a great deal of scope, at any rate for
                                sometime, for positive action in the negotiation of tariff
                                reductions.</item>

                            <item>On the other hand, we are running into serious problems with the
                                underdeveloped countries of Latin America on the tariffs which they
                                have bound under the General Agreement. The most striking and
                                immediate case is that of Brazil which has bound 1200/1300 items in
                                its tariff and is now embarking on a general increase in the tariff.
                                This move is partly due to revenue reasons and partly to the desire
                                to restore to the tariff the protectionist role which it has lost
                                and which is filled at present by currency manipulations and import
                                controls. This is merely an illustration of a more or less general
                                problem in Latin America. It seems to me that, consistently with the
                                philosophy of the General Agreement, we should be encouraging
                                countries to rely on the tariff as a normal means of protection and
                                to abandon the use of quantitative restrictions and other
                                administrative devices for protection such as multiple currency
                                practices. On the other hand, Brazil and other countries have bound
                                a considerable number of rates in the General Agreement, usually as
                                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0228"/>a result of carrying
                                over their previous bilateral agreements into the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, and therefore any general
                                increase in tariff rates presents a very serious problem under the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rules which only
                                contemplate the modification or withdrawal of concessions against
                                equivalent compensation, or failing that, compensatory withdrawals.
                                In the nature of the case, the possibility of compensation is
                                extremely limited and if the situation is redressed by compensatory
                                or retaliatory withdrawals, the content of the tariff commitment as
                                between these countries and the others would be reduced to little or
                                nothing. From a commercial point of view there would seem to be a
                                clear advantage in trying to reach an understanding with these
                                countries that in exchange for an alleviation of their tariff
                                commitments, they would abandon other forms of protection through
                                currency manipulation, quantitative restrictions, etc., which in
                                their effects are more burdensome to trade than tariffs. As the
                                Agreement stands, however, and failing a new approach, it seems
                                difficult to see how these problems can be dealt with. The position
                                is particularly complicated as regards the United States whose
                                participation in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is based
                                upon the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.</item>

                            <item>In the field of quantitative restrictions an honest appraisal of
                                the General Agreement can only lead to the conclusion that it has
                                hitherto proved ineffective and that the present indications are
                                that this ineffectiveness will continue. The only effective
                                international action in this field has been the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> liberalization programme which
                                proceeds on a very different basis from that contained in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. The action of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> is not confined to intra-European
                                trade but has also been extended to the liberalization of import
                                restrictions maintained by European countries in imports from the
                                United States and Canada. Consequently the field remaining to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is so limited as to be
                                almost non-existent.</item>

                            <item>It can be argued, perhaps, that this is not a bad thing since the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> action in relation to
                                quantitative restrictions would in any case be almost completely
                                inhibited by the way in which the quantitative restriction
                                provisions are written and the construction which has been placed on
                                the relative functions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                and the Fund.<note n="6" xml:id="d69fn6">International Monetary
                                    Fund.</note> Even though there were some improvements in the
                                procedures adopted in the Australian consultations in 1955, the fact
                                remains that consultations in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> are in general meaningless. In the first place, as
                                far as discrimination is concerned, the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> exercises no control whatsoever since contracting
                                parties which are still availing themselves of the transitional
                                provisions of the Fund Agreement have, in effect, a completely free
                                hand with quantitative restrictions. Secondly, as far as Article XII
                                is concerned, it suffices <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0229"
                                />for a country to obtain a certificate from the Fund that it has
                                balance-of-payments difficulties to secure complete immunity from
                                action by the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> on any
                                particular restrictions. Even if another contracting party is
                                prepared to make a formal complaint, it is doubtful whether the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> could act effectively,
                                since the blanket cover afforded by the Fund’s certificate is
                                all-embracing.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>We have also seen quite clearly that the relationships between the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the Fund are such
                                that, by virtue of Article XV:9 of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss>, it is possible for a country in
                                balance-of-payments difficulties by adopting various devices which
                                do not attract express Fund disapproval, to make nonsense out of any
                                and all of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> commitments.
                                This of course may be logical insofar as it may be argued that the
                                countries concerned are in such an acute state of financial chaos
                                that the utmost flexibility is essential. It remains, nevertheless,
                                that the participation of such countries in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is fictitious and casts little
                                credit on the organization.</item>

                            <item>As regards subsidies, the results of the Review were somewhat
                                meagre but the fruits in practice are likely to prove even more so.
                                Here again the only positive action that is being taken is in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and I am very doubtful
                                whether in present circumstances—or in any circumstances which I can
                                at the present foresee—the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> can
                                do much more than endorse such action as the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> may take. I doubt, however,
                                whether such endorsement would be of any great value. The
                                impossibility of reaching an agreement on banning subsidies in
                                primary products during the Review destroyed any real chance of
                                effective action on industrial subsidies. Developments since the
                                Review make it questionable how far even the modest progress then
                                made can be maintained.</item>

                            <item>There are many problems in the field of customs formalities which
                                could be tackled by the Contracting Parties with benefit to
                                international trade, but meanwhile most of the European governments
                                which adhere to the Agreement, have established another
                                organization—the Customs Co-operation Council—which is dealing with
                                these questions from the point of view of customs administration.
                                The membership of the Council is now being extended to countries
                                outside Europe. In this way, the Contracting Parties are leaving to
                                another body a sphere of activity which would rightly fall within
                                their competence and have accepted that these matters be considered
                                more from the point of view of administrative convenience than from

                            <item>So much for a brief analysis of the impotence of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in terms of subject matter. If we
                                look a little deeper into the fundamental position of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> it appears to be even weaker. In
                                the course of the Review I ventured to suggest that some
                                consideration be given to strengthening the Agreement by making
                                membership <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0230"/>more valuable,
                                or at least non-membership more perilous. This suggestion received
                                no support from the major powers who thought that the treatment of
                                non-members was a matter within the competence of each country. I
                                can see that there are very real difficulties in the way of
                                penalizing non-subscribers. It is all the more important to try to
                                maximise the attraction and advantages of membership. The present
                                position is that for many countries non-membership in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is a positive advantage. Let me
                                cite an example, which could be multiplied a number of times, the
                                position of a country like Mexico. Mexico has access to the
                                resources of the Export-Import Bank, to the resources of the Bank
                                and Fund, and full participation in the benefits of the Technical
                                Assistance programme. She also enjoys most-favoured-nation treatment
                                from the United States and other countries and therefore enjoys
                                without counterpart the benefit of all <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> bindings. On the other side of the picture, Mexico
                                has no commercial policy obligations whatsoever. The requirement
                                that a contracting party shall also accept the disciplines of the
                                Fund either by membership or by special exchange agreement finds no
                                counterpart in the Articles of the Fund.</item>

                                to some extent offset if participation in the Agreement offered
                                other demonstrable benefits. In this connexion however there has
                                been strong opposition to any suggestions for liberally interpreting
                                the functions of the Contracting Parties so as to include within the
                                purview of the Agreement matters which, though not normally germane
                                to a commercial treaty, are of primary concern to the less developed
                                countries. We have made a modest effort to improve the position by
                                instituting the Trainee Scheme. This was greeted with considerable
                                enthusiasm by the under-developed countries but with indifference by
                                some of the leading trading countries. At best it appears to have
                                carried grudging approval provided that it involved no increase in
                                the budget.</item>

                                outsiders received a recent and striking assessment when we issued
                                an invitation to negotiate for accession. Response: nil.</item>

                            <item>This narrow approach to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                has to be seen also in relation to the movement that has begun in
                                the United Nations for more cooperation in the trade field. Whatever
                                one may think of the motives which have inspired this movement, or
                                of the results which may flow from it, the fact remains that there
                                is a general consciousness <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0231"
                                />of the need for and importance of a world-wide organization for
                                dealing with trade problems. It had been my hope that when the
                                Organization for Trade Cooperation was established, it would be
                                possible to put it forward as the appropriate organization for
                                sponsoring world-wide cooperation in the trade field. I am now
                                beginning to have serious doubts about this in the light of recent
                                developments. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has drawn
                                attention to the gap in the existing international machinery for
                                trade cooperation, and it would be difficult to argue in present
                                circumstances that the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>—or even
                                the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> if it were established—could
                                fill that gap. Secondly, I had hoped that we could embody in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> a generous associate member
                                clause which would have facilitated cooperation of countries which,
                                though not desirous of subscribing to the specific <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> obligations, were anxious to take
                                part in cooperative action in the trade field. It would then have
                                been possible to channel suggestions, such as those that are being
                                made for intra-regional trade consultations, along safer and more
                                constructive lines than are likely to be followed in the United
                                Nations. There are, moreover, very real problems lying ahead in
                                relationships between the non-state trading countries and the state
                                trading countries. These again it seems to me can be more
                                constructively and safely handled in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> atmosphere
                                than in the more political atmosphere of the United Nations. In any
                                case they could hardly be ignored by an organization with any
                                serious claim to be considered as responsible for initiating
                                consultations on international trade problems and international
                                negotiations on trade matters.</item>

                            <item>There would be some compensation for these apparent weaknesses in
                                the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> structure if one could
                                discern elements of strength in other directions. These are not
                                altogether lacking. I particularly have in mind the increasing
                                support of the United Kingdom and the very striking change of front
                                in Australia. Moreover, Canada continues to be a strong supporter of
                                the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> although clearly public
                                support of this position is less strong than it was. The negative
                                factors are, however, disturbing. Though the United States
                                Administration continues to give strong public support to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, it is constrained by reasons of
                                internal politics to adopt a cautious line as regards the activities
                                and development of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</item>

                            <item>So far as the continental European countries are concerned,
                                although most of the countries express support at the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meetings, it is permissible to
                                doubt how much hold the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> has on
                                these countries and on public opinion. It is notorious that <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> obligations are considered very
                                light-heartedly in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. For
                                example, governments in the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                                refer without inhibition <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0232"/>to
                                quantitative restrictions which are maintained solely for
                                protectionist purposes or for bilateral bargaining. This never
                                appears to arouse any surprise even in the case of countries which
                                are at the same time parties to the General Agreement. In fact a
                                general air of polite scepticism regarding the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> prevails generally in <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> circles. More recently the
                                discussion of the common market has dominated the thoughts of the
                                principal European countries. It is significant but consistent with
                                what is said above that there is little disposition to associate the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> with the preparatory
                                discussions of this project even though its realization would
                                clearly have profound implications for the Contracting Parties. It
                                is clear that if a waiver is eventually required in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> the discussion of it would be
                                somewhat unreal since whatever European project is agreed upon will
                                have such powerful political support that the Contracting Parties’
                                action is unlikely to be more than a formality.</item>

                            <item>The position of the rest of our countries is somewhat different.
                                In the main I have the impression that the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> is unknown except to a limited group of officials
                                and that it is generally regarded as of only minor relevance to
                                major problems in these countries. It has always been a matter of
                                some surprise to me that these countries continue to find it
                                worthwhile to send delegations to meetings, the agenda of which can
                                be of very little concern or interest to them. An examination of
                                these agenda would demonstrate how difficult it would be to explain
                                in Santiago or Djakarta why money should be spent on sending
                                delegations long distances to attend them. Some countries, such as
                                Nicaragua, Peru and Uruguay appear already to have drawn this
                                conclusion since they are usually not represented. The
                                representation of others of these countries is more nominal than
                                real.</item>

                            <item>In brief, therefore, I see few comforting elements in the present
                                situation and a number of negative elements. In this situation it
                                seems to me essential that the leading countries provide dynamic
                                leadership which will revive and strengthen the interest of other
                                countries. In the past this leadership has sprung in the main from
                                the United States and related almost exclusively to tariff
                                reduction. During the Ninth Session it appeared that new leadership
                                would be provided by the United Kingdom as an essential part of a
                                drive towards the restoration of convertibility. For the moment the
                                steam appears to have gone out of this particular movement, although
                                it might conceivably revive in the future. There is a risk, however,
                                that meanwhile the somewhat shaky foundations of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> will be further weakened, in
                                which case it would be a frail instrument indeed to deal with the
                                difficult problems which would arise after restoration of a measure
                                of general currency convertibility.</item>

                            <item>This appraisal of the present situation of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> led me to suggest in April that
                                the first few days of each session should be devoted to an exchange
                                of views, at ministerial level, on the trends and problems in
                                international trade with a view to laying down broad general
                                directives to guide the Contracting Parties in their work. The
                                indifferent response I have had to this suggestion seems to indicate
                                that my pessimistic appraisal is justified.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John</persName></hi>:
                        Eric has sent me a copy of a memorandum which he has done appraising the
                        present status of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> which he tells
                        me he has also sent to you. I must say that I think the appraisal is pretty
                        realistic. We have a piece of machinery which we created at enormous effort
                        which we are not prepared really to use after we’ve got it.</p>
                    <p>The Brazilian problem lies directly within the competence of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. But unfortunately we have, in writing
                        the rules of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, so boxed ourselves
                        in that it is almost impossible to deal with it. As you know, I have for a
                        long time felt that many of the Latin American countries were in a position
                        which could not be sustained indefinitely since they had bound a wide range
                        of very low tariff rates which they would have to raise for revenue purposes
                        if for no other reason.</p>
                    <p>Eric is quite right in feeling that we would probably be better off if these
                        countries had slightly higher tariffs and could be induced to rely on the
                        tariff and decrease their reliance on quotas and exchange manipulations. I
                        confess I don’t know the answer to this problem, but I would hate to see us
                        continue to be in a position where our own rules keep us from achieving a
                        result which we might consider to be substantively desirable.</p>
                    <p>Eric is also quite right about our lack of use of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> on quotas. It has now become apparent
                        that a lot of countries, in Europe at least, are using quotas for protective
                        reasons which are not justified on balance of payments grounds. But the

                        see if we can’t do something about this because I should think that if we

                        on the vine as Eric feels it will.</p>
                    <p>Eric said that he had some very useful talks with <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Frank Southard</persName> on this subject and came
                        away hopeful that we might be able to work out something with the Fund that
                        would permit attack on these protective quotas without necessarily raising
                        the issue of Article XIV.</p>
                    <p>In all these issues and most of the others mentioned by Eric, our position is
                        decisive.</p>
                    <p>I understand there is a possibility that you might go along with the Boggs

                        enclosed memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Not printed.</note> sets
                        forth some of our views with respect to the international impact of Public
                        Law 480. It has been prepared in response to your request in connection with
                        your report to the Council on Foreign Economic Policy.</p>
                    <p>In general, our experience with Title I has not been sufficient to permit a
                        definitive evaluation of all aspects of its operation. Sales <pb n="205"
                            xml:id="pg_205" facs="0235"/>agreements have reached a large total in
                        value, but shipments of commodities have experienced a time-lag; and even a
                        longer delay has occurred with respect to loan agreements and the use of
                        foreign currencies.</p>
                    <p>The discernible results of Title I are mixed—some favorable, some
                        unfavorable. On the favorable side, a substantial quantity of commodities
                        has already moved and even larger quantities of surpluses will be moved in
                        the future. Importing countries have an opportunity to secure commodities
                        with minimum expenditure of their own resources. They are able to finance
                        economic development through long-term, low-interest loans. On the
                        unfavorable side, in spite of the restraint exercised by the Department of
                        Agriculture, there is the danger of displacing commercial markets,
                        disrupting prices and discouraging economic production. Title I programs
                        have disturbed our relations with a number of friendly foreign countries
                        exporting the same or competitive products on a commercial basis. It is
                        doubtful that the programs entered into have achieved or are likely to
                        achieve additional consumption which would not otherwise occur. The enclosed
                        memorandum is, for the most part, addressed to Title I.</p>
                    <p>The foreign policy interests of the United States have been well served by
                        Title II and those divisions of Title III which authorize donations to
                        non-profit voluntary agencies and international organizations, but even
                        these programs have been criticized on occasion by exporting countries as
                        interfering with normal marketing.</p>
                    <p>The barter operations under Title III are extremely complicated, and their
                        difficulties are not easily identifiable. In total, these transactions
                        present a danger of encouraging uneconomic production and displacing
                        competitive trade. The barter operations would profit by closer interagency
                        consultation and a more complete coordination of interdepartmental views. It
                        is the view of this Department that the size of the barter program needs to
                        be continued under strict limitations if disorganizations and distortions of
                        production and trade are to be held within manageable bounds.</p>

                        made to the conclusion reached in the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>
                        meeting of November 20 that an extension of Public Law 480 should be
                        recommended, with certain revisions.</p>
                    <p>Time was not available in that meeting to consider several recommendations
                        for legislative revision which the Department of State was prepared to
                        submit to the Council. In view of the Department’s interest in this matter,
                        it would be appreciated if the following suggestions could be considered in
                        the detailed development of the legislative program.</p>
                    <p>We suggest adoption of the recommendation by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HEB1"
                            >Hall</persName> in favor of an amendment to restrict sales under Title
                        I to commodities owned by the Government or for which the Government is
                        committed as a result of price support programs, in amounts exceeding a
                        reasonable carry-over. Our experience to date indicates that this would be
                        more effective than handling the problem by administrative action.</p>
                    <p>In order to provide stronger statutory safeguards against displacement of
                        commercial trade, the Department recommends that Section 101(a) be amended
                        by including the underlined inserts, as follows: <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208"
                            facs="0238"/>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“(a) take reasonable precautions to safeguard usual marketings of the
                                United States and <hi rend="italic">those of friendly third
                                    countries and</hi> to assure that sales under this Act <hi
                                    rend="italic">will result in increased consumption</hi> and will
                                not unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Department also wishes to recommend that the Act be amended to provide a
                        new subsection under Section 104, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“104(k) for financing programs of the international exchange of
                                persons activities under the programs authorized by Section 201 of
                                the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948,
                                as amended (22 U.S.C. 1446).”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>In connection with the deletion of Section 304, which was favored in the
                            <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> meeting of November 20, the
                        Department believes that authorization for barter is not needed in <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and would preferably be omitted in any
                        extension of this legislation.</p>
                    <p>We believe that these revisions would increase the constructive possibilities
                        of the legislation and further strengthen the safeguards against dangers
                        which were noted during the discussion by the Council. We will be glad to
                        discuss the proposals with interested agencies and look forward to assisting
                        in every way we can in the further preparation for action by Congress.</p>
                    <p>In view of the decision to recommend an extension of Title I operations, the
                        Department suggests that the possibility of making this Title applicable to
                        Bloc countries be examined as part of the proposed review in the near future
                        of sales policies and related legislation bearing on the question of trade
                        with the Bloc.</p>

                    <p>It was noted that the first public announcement of the Administration’s
                        decision to resubmit the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> to the Congress
                        was made that morning (November 26) by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> in his speech before the National Foreign Trade
                            Council.<note n="4" xml:id="d74fn4">The Secretary of Commerce spoke at
                            the 43d National Foreign Trade Convention held at the Waldorf Astoria in

                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> said that Commerce
                        plans to get all the mileage possible out of <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName>’ speech.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> expressed his confidence
                        that the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> would go straight through the
                        Congress but others, including Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1"
                            >McClellan</persName>, said they expected it would be a tough fight.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> suggested that <persName
                            corresp="#p_LJM1">John Leddy</persName> should again be given the task
                        of coordinating interagency staff work for the <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                            >OTC</gloss>, and that the White House should designate someone for
                        liaison with public groups as well as someone to handle Congressional
                        relations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> agreed with
                        the suggestion about <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John Leddy</persName>. He
                        also noted that the White House Congressional liaison was being organized on
                        a functional basis so that a single individual would carry through on a
                        particular subject both for the House and the Senate. It was announced that
                            <persName>Jack Martin</persName>, who unfortunately was out of town, had
                        been assigned the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> job.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the amended <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> bill
                        should be reintroduced. The possibility was discussed that only
                        supplementary hearings need be held in the House, perhaps by the <persName
                            corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0240"/>Subcommittee. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> felt that so far as the House was
                        concerned the less beating of drums the better. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> pointed out that one of the first
                        things to be done was to check with <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Jere
                            Cooper</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                        said that as soon as <persName>Jack Martin</persName> returned, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGD1">Morgan</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> should get together with him and
                        discuss tactics.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Authority for Customs
                            Reclassification</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KDW1">Kendall</persName> explained the Treasury
                        position that the Administration should not request advance authority to put
                        into effect the recommendations on tariff reclassification which the Tariff
                        Commission is scheduled to make by March 1958.</p>
                    <p>The principal reasons given were: an effort to get such advance authority in
                        the forthcoming session would dilute the effort on <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                            >OTC</gloss>; we do not know what the Tariff Commission will come up
                        with; and it will open up opposition to the effect that Congress is being
                        asked to buy a pig in a poke.</p>
                    <p>It was also decided that the Tariff Commission should be pressed to complete
                        its report by March 1958, and Mr. <persName>McPhee</persName> was requested
                        to follow up on this.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Frelinghuysen Bill</hi></p>
                    <p>This is the bill to increase the present customs exemption for returning
                        travellers from the present $500 to $1000. All agreed that it was a good
                        idea to include it in the President’s program for the coming session.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Preparations for Trade Agreements
                            Legislation in 1958</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> called for comments on the
                        State Department draft of terms of reference for an interdepartmental
                        working group to consider trade agreements renewal legislation. Only
                        Agriculture responded. They indicated they wished to add something to the
                        Department’s proposal but would submit it in writing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> suggested that the
                        interagency working group might be the same one that would work under
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John Leddy</persName> on the <gloss
                            target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> preparations. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> indicated that the latter was an
                        action job whereas the former required a study group. In any event he
                        suggested that the personnel of the group not be chosen until after the
                        first of the year.</p>
                    <p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGD1">Morgan</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> hoped the activities of such a group
                        would be kept confidential. Otherwise, the knowledge that the Administration
                        was preparing to seek new authority would arouse suspicions and adversely
                        affect the prospects for <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SDT1">Dan Throop Smith</persName> gave a number of
                        reasons why the Administration should not again seek legislation to provide

                        <item>It is just about impossible to separate out exporters from bona fide

                            tax provisions. Resubmission of the general tax concession proposals
                            might result in reopening the whole subject of the existing Western

                        <item>The oil companies would oppose the bill since they want both tax
                            depletion and the new tax concession, and not just a choice of either as

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> expressed the view that
                        the subject of tax concessions to stimulate foreign investment requires
                        further study and stated that he would ask Forrest Siefkin of his staff to
                        undertake such a study. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFD1">Siefkin</persName>
                        is from International Harvester and has had considerable experience in the
                        tax field. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> thought that
                        one aspect that should be looked into is the possibility of investment of
                        mutual funds in foreign undertakings.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Kal</hi>: May I make this suggestion by way of
                        reply to your letter of November 23 on the subject of Public Law 480? As
                        soon as it can be done after our return from the Pacific, I shall call
                        another meeting of the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss> to consider
                        questions having to do with the administration of this law, as distinguished
                        from the law itself.</p>
                    <p>At that time, I shall be very glad to afford you an opportunity to present to
                        the Council itself any proposals that you may wish for <pb n="212"
                            xml:id="pg_212" facs="0242"/>amendments to the law, even though some of
                        them may require reconsideration of the formal actions taken on November
                        20.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I feel that it would be inappropriate for the Administration to
                        suggest amendments.</p>
                    <p>This is a bad law. We all know it. We are therefore struggling to meet the
                        practical situation without perpetuating a law which we wish circumstances
                        did not require.</p>
                    <p>I hope the Administration will make it clear that it believes the law to be
                        bad and, therefore, one to be extended for the minimum term.</p>
                    <p>For the Administration itself to suggest amendments does two things which I
                        believe to be undesirable: (a) it takes the edge off our criticism of the
                        law and suggests that we ourselves are trying to shape it towards
                        permanency; (b) it invites Congress to make amendments, and we would get
                        them by the bushel. We would have amendments to the amendments.</p>
                    <p>I hope you will find this procedure satisfactory.<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2"

                            of the Department’s objectives could be partially achieved by
                            administrative arrangements without actual revision of the <gloss

                    </list>
                    <p>This question was recently considered by the Council and further
                        consideration was expected at approximately this time. Recent developments,
                        in the view of the Department of State, make it a matter of urgency that the
                        Council should consider a modification of existing policy.</p>
                    <p>The Department recommends that United States policy should allow surplus
                        agricultural commodities to be exported to Eastern European countries when
                        political developments, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, indicate
                        that it is in our national interest for these commodities to be exported for
                        dollars at world market prices.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes that this recommendation is in accord with the views
                        of the members of the Council. The prompt approval by the Council is sought.
                        Upon such approval and following such consultation with Congressional
                        leaders as may be determined to be appropriate, the Department would
                        instruct the American Embassy in Warsaw to inform the Government of Poland
                        that the United States is prepared to discuss some of the commodities in
                        which Poland has recently expressed an interest. The change of policy would
                        also place the Administration in a position of readiness to take prompt
                        advantage of other opportunities which might arise in Eastern Europe.</p>

                        attention of the Council at this time.</p>

                                >TO</gloss> BLOC COUNTRIES AT WORLD PRICES</head>
                        <p>The Administration has been concerned for some time with the problem of
                            establishing adequate means to exploit opportunities for advantageous
                            placement of surplus commodities in Eastern Europe. This problem has
                            been given particular urgency by the current interest of Poland in
                            acquiring United States cotton and other agricultural and
                            non-agricultural products if they are available at world market
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>The Administration emphasized to the last Congress the need for
                            flexibility in arranging transactions with Eastern European countries if
                            full advantage is to be taken of special circumstances arising from time
                            to time which cannot be foreseen in detail. The importance of being in a
                            position to capitalize on opportunities for the employment of surpluses
                            to foster foreign policy objectives has become even more evident.</p>
                        <p>Title II of Public Law 480 can be used in cases of famine or other
                            emergency. Title III can be used for donations through private
                            organizations or international agencies. These authorities, however, are
                            not well adapted to all of the cases in which the interests of the
                            United States could be promoted by the use of surplus commodities.</p>
                        <p>At a later time it may be possible to arrange barter transactions or
                            sales for foreign currencies, but those programs are prohibited by
                            statute as regards countries in the Soviet Bloc at this time. Some of
                            the opportunities in Eastern Europe, however, call for prompt
                            action.</p>
                        <p>There is legislative authority for sales of surplus commodities for
                            dollars at export subsidy prices. Such exports to satellite countries
                            are not prohibited by any statute, but they are not allowed under the
                            existing policy of the Executive Branch. Modification of this policy to
                            allow sales at the same prices which apply to U.S. exports to other
                            destinations could be accomplished quickly if the Administration were to
                            consider this to be advantageous.</p>
                        <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0245"/>
                        <p>The current interest of Poland in cotton illustrates an opportunity of
                            which advantage could well be taken through a modification of the dollar
                            sales policy. Poland appears to be interested in purchasing
                            15,000-20,000 metric tons of U.S. cotton. This transaction would involve
                            $10 million or somewhat more at world market prices. The indications are
                            that the Government of Poland would need deferred payment terms, but
                            would also insist that the transaction should be designed along
                            commercial lines and not be accompanied by any political strings.</p>
                        <p>The National Security Council has decided that economic assistance in
                            moderate amounts should be made available to Poland. It is felt to be
                            highly desirable that the U.S. place itself in a position to explore
                            with the Government of Poland practical ways by which assistance could
                            be extended in meeting this requirement for cotton.</p>
                        <p>As a prerequisite to the undertaking of detailed discussions with Poland,
                            the United States would need to be prepared to sell cotton at world
                            market prices and to have some means of providing financing if credit is
                            required. Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act could be employed to
                            finance this sale, although the funds made available by that Section
                            would not be sufficient to finance similar transactions with satellite
                            countries on a continuing substantial scale.</p>
                        <p>This Section would not be drawn upon for the Polish transaction if
                            another source of credit were available. Because of the provisions of
                            the Battle Act, however, there does not seem to be another source of
                            credit readily available for the transaction immediately in view.</p>
                        <p>A modification of the existing dollar sales policy seems desirable in the
                            particular case of cotton for Poland, and it also seems desirable to
                            take the occasion to obtain a broader change of policy which would apply
                            to any of the European satellites. This would avoid the necessity for
                            obtaining separate exceptions if opportunities should arise later in the
                            case of Rumania, Hungary, or some other Eastern European satellites.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the change of policy for Eastern Europe need not apply to
                            the Soviet Union. There is no clear prospect of sales to that country.
                            The change of policy could be accomplished by administrative action and
                            therefore need not create a formal public differentiation which would
                            threaten to prevent countries in the current situation of Poland from
                            feeling able to enter into the type of transaction envisaged. The Far
                            Eastern Communist countries are not likely, for the present at least, to
                            present advantageous opportunities. We conclude that the existing policy
                            should remain in effect for them.</p>

                        <item>Canadian Reaction to U.S. Foreign Economic Policy</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>There has recently been a resurgence of Canadian criticism, expressed both by
                        government officials and in the press, of United States foreign economic
                        policies which, the Canadians believe, have damaged markets for Canadian
                        exports. Criticism has centered on the U.S. surplus disposal program, and
                        especially during the past few weeks on the feature of tied sales. The
                        Export-Import Bank and other programs which aid customers for American goods
                        have also been mentioned as disrupting Canadian export trade.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested that U.S. import barriers are unreasonably restrictive
                        when compared with the liberal trade policy followed by Canada, which is
                        both our best customer and our biggest supplier. Some Canadians think that
                        the United States has not paid sufficient attention to Canadian interests in
                        formulating its foreign economic policies, considering the degree of
                        economic interdependence between the two countries. The situation has been
                        aggravated by the traditional Canadian deficit in trade with the United
                        States, which may reach one billion dollars this year, and by the small
                        degree to which Canadians participate in ownership and management of
                        Canadian corporations controlled by United States citizens.</p>
                    <p>In general, the reaction of Canadians to United States foreign economic
                        policies which they believe have hurt them seems to be that Canada cannot
                        possibly compete with the United States by establishing her own
                        export-promotion programs, and that a complete withdrawal from a liberal
                        trade policy would be unwise. However, there have been suggestions that
                        pressures be brought to bear on the United States to change her policies, by
                        cutting purchases of farm machinery and other United States products, by
                        discussing the matters in international forums such as the meetings of the
                        Contracting Parties to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>, and in general by making their
                        views and fears known to this country. A less cooperative attitude on the
                        part of the Canadian Government toward American interests may already have
                        been felt, and could be very <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0248"
                        />unfortunate in connection with American economic, political and military
                        relations with Canada.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of this paper consists of examples of the Canadian attitude
                        toward United States foreign economic policies as shown in diplomatic notes,
                        public speeches and newspaper commentaries.</p>

                    <p>The Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce, <persName corresp="#p_HCD1">C.D.
                            Howe</persName>, told Parliament on August 9 that United States
                        procedures for disposal of surplus farm products had been very harmful.
                        After the public had become aware of the tied-sales clause in some <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreements, he said in a speech on
                        October 9, according to the Montreal <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>, that the
                        United States is attempting to tie up markets for a long period of time.</p>
                    <p>Speaking in Milwaukee, <persName corresp="#p_HCD1">Howe</persName> said on
                        October 16:</p>
                    <p>There is, in the Canadian view, nothing to be gained by one country
                        attempting to dump its surplus problems on to the other. This can only have
                        the effect of making the whole problem worse. I believe that we in Canada
                        have practiced what we preach. Our wheat has all been sold for Canadian
                        currency, which, as you know, is as hard as the United States dollar, at
                        steady prices and there has been no subsidization of production or export
                        sales.</p>
                    <p>A Canadian note delivered to the Department of State on September 4 included
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>The Canadian Ambassador is …<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">All ellipses are in
                            the source text.</note> under instruction to express, as has been done
                        on several previous occasions, the serious concern of the Canadian
                        Government about the effects of the surplus disposal activities of the
                        United States upon commercial markets for wheat, and particularly upon
                        markets which under ordinary competitive conditions would be supplied by
                        Canada. Notwithstanding these representations, the United States has
                        increased the pace of its wheat disposal activities with the effects upon
                        commercial markets that the Canadian Government had forecast.</p>
                    <p>… The evidence suggests to the Canadian Government that the main result of
                        the various surplus disposal programmes has been to reduce ordinary
                        commercial markets and to cause serious damage to the interests of friendly
                        countries, such as Canada, which, unlike the United States, depend so
                        largely upon the export of wheat.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the tied-sales feature of the agreement with Brazil, the note
                        referred to “discriminatory practices, so clearly at variance with the
                        professed objective of the United States Government in matters of trade.”
                        The note concluded with the statement that the Canadian Government is “much
                        perturbed by the use of economic <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0249"
                        />aid as a device to prevent Brazil from exercising a free choice in
                        spending dollars to buy wheat.”</p>
                    <p>At the Eleventh Session of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement
                        on Tariffs and Trade, Mr. <persName>Isbister</persName><note n="3"
                            xml:id="d79fn3">C.M. Isbister, Director of the International Trade

                        the Canadian delegation discussed the surplus disposal problem at a plenary
                        meeting with special reference to the United States.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>… His Government had made clear to the United States Government its
                            concern about the increasing number of countries whose markets were
                            being affected by surplus disposals. With respect to wheat, of direct
                            concern to Canada, he recognized the willingness of the United States to
                            consult at all times, but his Government had noted with regret that its
                            representations were having less effect upon the actual transactions in
                            this field. In the view of his delegation, damage to normal trade was
                            particularly likely to arise when the United States required a country
                            purchasing a surplus on concessional terms to commit itself to purchase
                            an additional quantity from the United States for dollars. This was a
                            discriminatory practice preventing other exporters from competing and

                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garran</persName>, at his request, called upon Mr.
                            <persName>Dillon</persName>. He said his primary interest at the moment
                        was the wool textile problem which arose as a result of the exercise by the
                        United States of its reservation on wool under <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">On September 28, 1956,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> issued
                            Proclamation 3160 establishing a quota for certain woolen and worsted
                            fabrics. It provided that the ad valorem rate of duty applying to most
                            imported woolen textiles would be increased when such goods exceeded 5
                            percent of the average U.S. annual production calculated over 3 years.
                            The President’s action was authorized under paragraphs 1108 and 1109a,
                            Section 350 (a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, and under the Geneva Protocol
                            to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, signed October 30, 1947.
                            For texts of the White House announcement of the wool quota and the
                            President’s proclamation, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bulletin</hi>, October 8, 1956, pp. 555–557.</note> Mr.
                            <persName>Garran</persName> reiterated the British view that tariff
                        quotas should be sparingly resorted to and pointed out the effects such a
                        quota would have on the sizeable British trade in the item. He said he hoped
                        the United States would set the level of imports to enter at the lower duty
                        under the tariff quota at as high a percentage of domestic production of
                        wool textiles as possible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> told Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> that
                        discussions were scheduled for the afternoon and that he would know more of
                        the progress of the report to the President at that time. He assured Mr.
                            <persName>Garran</persName> that the Department was giving most careful
                        consideration to the British views. In answer to Mr.
                            <persName>Dillon</persName>’s inquiry into the arrangement the British
                        might find most acceptable Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> said that he
                        rather hoped that six and one-half per cent of domestic production could
                        enter as imports at the lower duty and that the minimum figure of five per
                        cent would not be settled on. Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> described the
                        nature of the British textile trade and the advantage of the higher figure.
                        Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> thanked Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> for
                        his explanation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> inquired into the status of the legislation
                        on <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">H.R.
                            6630, which authorized U.S. membership in the proposed Organization for
                            Trade Cooperation, was introduced in the House of Representatives in
                            April after the President sent a special message to Congress urging its
                            passage. For text of the message, April 3, 1957, see <hi rend="italic"
                                >ibid.,</hi> April 22, 1957, p. 657. The House Ways and Means
                            Committee subsequently discussed the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>
                            bill in executive session but neither scheduled hearings nor voted
                            formally on the bill. The Senate Finance Committee took no action on the
                            bill.</note> Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> said it was difficult to
                        speculate on the chances of action <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0251"
                        />on the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> bill, but that he felt that
                        when legislative committee hearings were held strong proponents of <gloss
                            target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> would come forward to testify. Mr.
                            <persName>Dillon</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                            >OTC</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_ITO1">ITO</gloss>) had got off to a
                        rather bad start in the beginning (1947) but that over the years its
                        supporters had increased, some of whom came from industries originally in
                        opposition. However, Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> added that a long
                        contest was still to be fought and that liberal trade policy would likely be
                        a major issue in the coming year. Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> told Mr.
                            <persName>Garran</persName> he remained an optimist until, and, in the
                        event of defeat, even after, a battle were lost. Mr.
                            <persName>Garran</persName> said he was pleased to find such optimism
                        when most observers were generally pessimistic on <gloss target="#t_OTC1"
                            >OTC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garran</persName> briefly mentioned the <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                            >ODM</gloss> hearing on woolen textiles scheduled for June 3. Mr.
                            <persName>Dillon</persName> said he had spoken with <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> Chairman <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                            >Gray</persName> and learned that the hearing was to consider a
                        long-standing petition that imports of woolen textiles constituted a threat
                        to national security as defined under Section 7(b) of the Trade Agreements
                        Extension Act of 1955. Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> added that the
                        hearing was mandatory and should not be considered as indicating any <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> position on the merits of the case.</p>

                            <item>The attitude of the Australian Government towards the farm surplus
                                problem has been made known to the United States Administration on a
                                number of occasions over the past two or three years. It may be
                                summarised as follows: <list>

                                    <item>Australia recognises that the problem of surplus
                                        production is, in many respects, a result of the great
                                        efforts made by United States agriculture to meet the
                                        special problems of war and post-war world food
                                        shortages.</item>

                                    <item>It is also recognised that, the world having emerged from
                                        the position of food shortages, the necessary re-adjustments
                                        of the level and pattern of United States farm production
                                        pose very great economic, social, and political difficulties
                                        for the Administration, as well as for farmers
                                        themselves.</item>

                                    <item>The Australian Government appreciates that the United
                                        States Administration has made substantial progress towards
                                        restoring a reasonable balance between production and market
                                        opportunities for a number of commodities. Recent
                                        legislation, including particularly the “Soil Bank”
                                            programme,<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">Reference is to

                                            1956. The soil bank program, by providing financial

                                            cultivation, was designed primarily to reduce farm
                                            surplus production. For text, see 70 Stat. 188.</note>
                                        appears to offer promise that further progress will be made
                                        towards solving the fundamental problem of excess
                                        production, which gives rise to farm surpluses.</item>

                                    <item>In spite of these developments, however, the fact remains
                                        that existing stocks of surplus farm commodities constitute
                                        a continuing threat to the stability of world trade in these
                                        products.</item>

                                    <item>The Australian Government has never sought to deny these
                                        surplus products entry into world trade channels. Nor has it
                                        ever sought to obstruct their disposal, on generous
                                        concessional terms, for consumption by needy peoples who
                                        would not otherwise be able to purchase like commodities
                                        under commercial trading conditions. But the Australian
                                        Government has striven consistently to ensure that the
                                        arrangements made by the United States and other countries
                                        for the disposal of surplus stocks on concessional terms
                                        should cause the least possible disturbance to traditional
                                        commercial trading patterns. It has felt entitled to claim
                                        that the legitimate trade interests of Australia, and of
                                        other countries, should be respected. Whilst we cannot hope,
                                        in respect of each and every transaction, to eliminate the
                                        possibility of some damage to our interests, the Australian
                                        Government regards as completely reasonable its request that
                                        the United States should so arrange its disposal programme
                                        that the disruptive effects of individual transactions are
                                        reduced to a minimum.</item>

                                    <item>The Australian Government has taken the view that undue
                                        disturbance of commercial trade can be avoided only if the
                                        parties to <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0253"/>a
                                        concessional disposal transaction afford other countries,
                                        whose interests are likely to be affected, the opportunity
                                        for effective consultations. To be effective, such
                                        consultations must represent far more than advice that a
                                        disposal transaction is being negotiated. They must provide
                                        for the transmission of information concerning the proposal
                                        in sufficient detail and in sufficient time for the
                                        interested country to examine the proposal usefully, and to
                                        make known its views to the parties to the proposal. And
                                        above all, the whole procedure of consultations can serve no
                                        purpose unless the representations made in the course of
                                        consultations are given full and genuine consideration by
                                        the country disposing of the surpluses.</item>

                            <item><p>In accordance with the attitude summarised above, the
                                    Australian Government has endeavoured to operate procedures for
                                    friendly and constructive consultations with the United States
                                    on all disposal transactions of interest to us. Considerable
                                    material, relating to particular transactions and to the markets
                                    and commodities of interest to Australia, has been provided for
                                    the use of the United States Authorities. One of the
                                    difficulties which we have experienced is that there appears to
                                    have been frequent changes of personnel in the branches of the
                                    United States Departments concerned with disposal activities.
                                    The Australian Government would hope that officers taking over
                                    new appointments are acquainted with the material provided by
                                    Australia so that full consideration may be given to the
                                    representations made from time to time.</p>
                                <p>It is a matter for regret by the Australian Government that the
                                    consultative procedures have not always proved effective. The
                                    recent Indian transaction<note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">On August
                                        29, 1956, India signed an agreement with the United States
                                        at New Delhi to purchase over $360 million of surplus U.S.
                                        commodities over a 3-year period. For further details, see

                                    position in which the Australian Government is placed unless the
                                    United States, by providing adequate time and information and by
                                    giving full consideration to our representations, is prepared to
                                    make the consultation technique worthwhile. The Australian
                                    Government would hope that the United States will, in the
                                    future, pay particular attention to this point.</p>

                            <item>Apart from the question of consultations referred to above, there
                                are two aspects of the United States surplus disposal activities
                                which are of growing concern to the Australian Government. The first
                                is the apparent tendency by the United States to regard a
                                concessional disposal transaction as a means of determining the <pb
                                    n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0254"/>pattern of commercial
                                imports of a particular country. The Australian Government has no
                                quarrel with the principle that a country obtaining farm commodities
                                on concessional terms from the United States should undertake to
                                purchase on a commercial basis, without distinction as to source,
                                stated minimum quantities of the same products. Provided the level
                                of the “minimum guaranteed commercial purchases” is realistically
                                related to the normal commercial imports of the country concerned,
                                this device could be a very useful safeguard to commercial
                                suppliers. However, it is an entirely different proposition when the
                                recipient country is obliged, as a condition of a concessional
                                arrangement, to obtain a disproportionate share of its commercial
                                imports from the United States. The use of concessional sales
                                techniques to induce importers to thus “tie-up” their commercial
                                purchases for the benefit of the United States is, in the opinion of
                                the Australian Government, contrary to every concept of fair trade
                                practices.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The second important point of concern to the Australian Government
                                is the suggestion that it is completely open to the United States to
                                take advantage of so-called “fortuitous” marketing opportunities to
                                move surplus stocks on concessional terms. This point may be
                                illustrated in two ways. It has been suggested that if, for example,
                                Japan requires unusually high imports of wheat in a particular year,
                                other wheat exporting countries should have no ground for complaint
                                if the United States meets the exceptional import demand by
                                supplying surplus stocks on concessional terms, even if in the same
                                year another country (e.g. India) should require substantially
                                less-than-normal imports. Again, it was suggested in discussions on
                                the recent Ceylon transaction that Australia would not be affected
                                by the importation by Ceylon of concessional United States flour,
                                since the United States flour would replace flour which would have
                                been imported from France had not that country suffered crop damage.
                                The Australian Government cannot accept the principle implied in
                                these suggestions that the supply of goods to meet “abnormal” market
                                opportunities such as these should be regarded as the prerogative of
                                the United States disposal authorities. Such “abnormalities” are, of
                                course, characteristic of normal commercial marketing. The “ups and
                                downs” of the market, in different places or at different times, to
                                some extent offset each other. The removal, as a result of United
                                States disposal policies, of the opportunity for other exporters to
                                “make good” reduced trade in one market by additional trade to
                                another, or to compensate low shipments at one time by higher
                                shipments at another time, is a pronounced destabilising factor in
                                world trade in primary products.</item>

                        to avoid being a Moscow tool. He indicated that the Polish request was
                        larger than what the United States could do in terms of money but that
                        adequate action might be accomplished through the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 program if the new legislation is approved. Any

                        recent meeting with three exiled Polish leaders who very much favored the
                        aid program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> noted the Canadian interest
                        in any agreement involving surplus wheat. He said that it seemed possible to
                        work out something that would not affect Canadian shipments of wheat. The
                        Poles could not fill their requirements completely from Canada, since
                        Canadian credits are not available. The President noted the importance of
                        avoiding any new cause for difference between Canada and the United States.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> stated that he had told
                        Canadian officials that the United States would not send any wheat to Poland

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: Before leaving for Bonn, the
                        Secretary asked me to reply to your letter of March 13, 1957, in which you
                        enclosed a memorandum on surplus disposal. He had hoped to be able to give
                        you a detailed reply to the points which you raised. However, since these
                        matters are complicated and involve several agencies of the Government it
                        has not yet been possible to give them the full consideration which they
                        warrant.</p>
                    <p>I assure you that the United States endeavors to conduct its disposal
                        activities in a way that will minimize the disruption of normal marketing
                        patterns, and our search for safeguards against injury to the trade of
                        friendly competing countries is a continuing process. The possibilities for
                        modifying our consultation and programming procedures along lines suggested
                        by your memorandum <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0257"/>are being
                        explored, and I have requested other interested agencies of this Government
                        to give the matter their urgent attention.</p>

                    <p>The Minister of External Affairs of Australia has recently sent the Secretary
                        a memorandum on U.S. agricultural surplus disposal.<note n="2"

                        sums up so well the attitude of Australia and other friendly exporting
                        nations towards our surplus disposal programs, I am taking the liberty of
                        sending you herewith a copy together with a copy of my reply.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d84fn3"><ref target="#d83"><hi rend="italic"

                        summarizes the Department of State’s position regarding the specific
                        objections raised by Australia.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4"><ref

                    <p>These objections have been raised before, both by the Australians and others,
                        but they have now become a source of considerable friction in our
                        international relations and we feel that the time has come for the
                        interested U.S. agencies to explore the possibilities of undertaking more
                        effective remedial action.</p>
                    <p>I should, therefore, very much appreciate receiving your views on these

                        <p>The Australians have long been dissatisfied with U.S. surplus disposal
                            practices and have registered numerous protests in cases where they
                            believe their interests have been affected. Similar representations have
                            been made by the Canadians, not only in the recent wheat talks but also
                            by the Prime Minister in a letter to President <persName

                            reduce to a minimum the points at which our respective interests

                        <p>While the Australians tend to object to our disposal programs as a matter
                            of principle, even when injury to the Australian economy is slight,
                            there does appear to be considerable justification for some of the
                            points made, particularly the statements that consultation procedures
                            are inadequate and that the United States uses special disposal programs
                            to take advantage of fortuitous market opportunities to the exclusion of
                            other suppliers.</p>
                        <p>As the agency primarily concerned with foreign policy, the Department of
                            State must, of course, accept the primary responsibility for any
                            shortcomings in consultation procedures. In light of recent
                            developments, this Department feels that past practices leave something
                            to be desired. Consultation in the past has consisted largely of
                            informing friendly competitor nations of Title I agreements almost on
                            the eve of their signature when there was little possibility of altering
                            the programs, even if convincing arguments for so doing were advanced.
                            There has been no consultation on Section 402 programs. While the United
                            States must reserve to itself the final decision as to whether any
                            proposed program should be carried out, consultation with interested
                            friendly countries could round out our own thinking and provide a
                            desirable balance in our approach to disposal problems. Meaningful prior
                            consultation, moreover, could <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"
                            />do much to improve our relations with other countries, regardless of
                            substantive changes in our disposal programs. We should like, therefore,
                            to work out with the other agencies concerned, particularly with the
                            Department of Agriculture and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>,
                            consultation procedures that will substantially meet the desires of
                            other exporting countries on this point.</p>
                        <p>With regard to fortuitous market opportunities, it frequently develops
                            that a country that does not normally import a given agricultural
                            product is forced to do so because of crop failure or other reasons.
                            Similarly, a country that normally does import a given agricultural
                            product may find its import requirements increased substantially in any
                            one year. With rapidly growing populations, the incidence of such
                            fortuitous market opportunities will likely increase in the future.</p>
                        <p>There can, of course, be no valid objection to our entering such markets
                            as long as this is done on a competitive basis. A problem is created,
                            however, if we satisfy these exceptional demands on concessional terms
                            through one or another of our surplus disposal programs and render it
                            almost impossible for friendly countries to participate in such markets
                            on a commercial basis. Since increased requirements in some areas are
                            commonly offset by reduced requirements in others, such practices
                            obviously narrow the possibilities for export by other countries. While
                            it is not suggested that we refrain from engaging in disposal operations
                            where fortuitous market opportunities develop, we should use moderation
                            and make every effort to leave to commercial competition, including our
                            own, a substantial portion of such markets. Here again, we recognize
                            that the Department of State may, to some extent, have been responsible
                            for promoting programs that have virtually excluded other countries from
                            commercial competition in certain markets.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing, the Australian memorandum also raised
                            objections to the usual marketing provisions included in Public Law 480
                            agreements. The usual requirement under this heading is that countries
                            obtaining commodities under Title I programs also take specified
                            quantities of the same commodities from the U.S. on a commercial basis.
                            The terms of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 unquestionably
                            require us to protect U.S. normal marketings. We should be pleased,
                            however, if an alternative procedure more acceptable to other exporting
                            countries could be worked out and thought is being given in the

                        <item>Proposed new tariffs on lead and zinc</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>As part of a proposal for a long range minerals program the Department of
                        Interior is recommending additional tariffs on the importation of lead and
                        zinc. This proposal is supported by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName>, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HG1"
                            >Hauge</persName> feels that some action to restrict imports is
                        necessary, although he does not specifically approve the Interior
                        Department’s proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Interior desires to send their proposals to the Congress in
                        the immediate future and their report will be under consideration at the
                        White House this week.</p>
                    <p>Such additional restrictions will have very damaging effect on our relations
                        with Canada, Mexico, Australia, and to a lesser extent, Peru and Belgium. To
                        take action now, as recommended by Interior, without a new study by the
                        Tariff Commission would seem to violate our obligations under <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, and therefore would seriously weaken our
                        ability to protect the interests of U.S. exporters.</p>
                    <p>Even if it is decided, as a result of domestic pressure, that some action
                        must be taken to increase tariffs, there is an important question of timing
                        involved. To avoid embarrassment for the Canadian Government no public
                        announcement regarding the possibility of such increases should be made
                        prior to the election on June 10. Any announcement should also be delayed,
                        if at all possible, until after the Buenos Aires Economic Conference in
                            August.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">The Economic Conference of the

                                        an adverse Congressional sentiment that all our efforts to
                                        liberalize trade would be swept aside. I agreed the
                                        situation might call for some protective action, but felt
                                        strongly we should at first at least get the report from the
                                        Tariff Commission. Since this would take more time than the
                                        balance of Congress, he could perhaps indicate his
                                        willingness to act affirmatively if such a report showed
                                        that the present market condition was due to imports.”

                    </list>
                    <p>This is in reply to your memorandum of May 4 on U.S. agricultural surplus
                        disposal to which was attached a memorandum from the Australian Minister of
                        External Affairs, same subject.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that our foreign policies and our domestic policies may seem to
                        be, and no doubt are, at times contradictory, and that there is little hope
                        of fully reconciling them, in part because much of the difficulty results
                        from Congressional action. Perhaps the Administration should make a more
                        determined effort to assure that the Congress is aware of the foreign policy
                        implications of domestic <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"
                        />legislation, particularly agricultural legislation, than it has done at
                        times in the past. Would it be desirable for the Department of State to
                        follow domestic legislative proposals more closely and to request an
                        opportunity to be heard in every instance in which it appears that proposals
                        may have a serious adverse effect on foreign relations?</p>
                    <p>We suggest also that it would be highly desirable to be clear among ourselves
                        and to make clear to other countries the essential difference between Title
                        I of Public Law 480 and Section 402 of the Mutual Security Act.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d86fn2">The Mutual Security Act of 1954 (<gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >P.L.</gloss> 665), enacted August 26, 1954; for text, see 68 Stat.
                            832.</note> The essential purpose of the former is to dispose of
                        agricultural surpluses on terms which may be concessional but at the same
                        time designed to afford the greatest possible returns to the United States.
                        Except for those few Title I agreements which have been initiated to provide
                        economic aid in lieu of the use of the Mutual Security Act for such purposes
                        and excluding political considerations, the objective has been to make sales
                        which maximize financial returns to the United States and correspondingly
                        minimize loans for economic development.</p>
                    <p>Since the enactment of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, sales under
                        Title I have constituted a significant proportion of international trade in
                        agricultural products. Such sales may have interfered to some extent with
                        other supplying countries’ sales of such products. Because of the volume of
                        Title I sales and because such sales may be concessional and intended to
                        maximize returns to the United States, and minimize economic assistance to
                        the buying country, it is understandable that other supplying countries
                        would be concerned about interference with their own sales.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Section 402 of Public Law 665, the criterion is entirely
                        different. The countries to which sales are made are selected upon the basis
                        of judgment on the part of the United States that it is in the U.S. interest
                        to provide them with economic assistance. The provision of this economic
                        assistance, incidentally, is in the interest, in the long-run, of the whole
                        free world and not only of the United States. Since we can provide economic
                        assistance in an amount equal to the minimum earmarking of Section 402 only
                        by the provision of agricultural products, it inevitably follows that this
                        magnitude of economic assistance must be provided in this way or not at all.
                        We should recognize that the provision of economic assistance in this form
                        may interfere with sales which might otherwise be made by a supplying
                        country and which the supplying country may consider normal marketings. We
                        should not attempt to argue, therefore, that economic assistance provided as
                        required by law in the form of <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0263"
                        />agricultural commodities does not upon occasion interfere with normal
                        marketings. We should recognize this fact frankly and at the same time point
                        out the alternative would be the failure to provide such assistance.</p>
                    <p>In this connection it might be noted that Australia as well as other
                        countries, such as Canada, are furnishing modest amounts of economic
                        assistance under the Colombo Plan or otherwise. So far as we are aware,
                        these countries, including Australia, provide such assistance exclusively
                        from their own production. As it happens, the assistance they provide is
                        usually in the form of products other than agricultural commodities, but the
                        principle is the same. The provision by Australia of tractors to Vietnam or
                        by Canada of a pumping station to India, may interfere with a sale which a
                        United States producer otherwise might make. So far as I am aware we have
                        not objected to this policy. We suggest that it is somewhat less than
                        appropriate for other countries to object to the United States adopting the
                        same policy in respect to only a small portion of the much larger magnitude
                        of economic aid which this country is furnishing under <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 665. I feel, therefore, we should make no
                        apologies in those instances in which provision of economic aid under
                        Section 402 interferes with the potential sale of agricultural products by
                        another supplying country.</p>
                    <p>The volume of economic aid under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 665
                        provided in the form of agricultural products has been steadily declining.
                        Back in the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Marshall</persName> Plan days it
                        amounted to nearly a billion dollars a year. Two years ago the Congress
                        placed a minimum of $300 million on this form of assistance; last year the
                        minimum was reduced to $250 million and, as you know, we are requesting the
                        Congress again to reduce the minimum for next year to $175 million. We have
                        felt that the provision of economic aid was sufficiently in the U.S. and
                        free world interests to assure that we achieve the minimum required by the
                        Congress to be furnished in the form of agricultural commodities, but we
                        have not advocated programs—as perhaps we could have done and certainly many
                        people feel we should—to substantially exceed these minimums.</p>

                        aware of the sensitiveness of other supplying countries on the matter of
                        surplus agricultural products as we plan our Section 402 programs. We
                        consult continuously with the Department of State and have advised that we
                        have no objections to discussing the general scope and content of these
                        programs in the Interagency Staff Committee on Surplus Disposals. Secondly,
                        insofar as we are aware, only one complaint has been raised about our
                        Section 402 program this fiscal year. This particular complaint involved
                        less than one percent of the <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0264"/>entire
                        program. It is suggested, therefore, that we are handling a sensitive
                        problem with a fair amount of judgment and success.</p>
                    <p>Returning again to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, primary
                        responsibility for the sales agreements rests, as you know, with the
                        Department of Agriculture. I assume, therefore, that you have posed the
                        issues raised by the Australian Aide-mémoire to that Agency. Perhaps
                        improvement in the Title I consultation procedure with other supplying
                        countries can be worked out with that Department. In view of the very large
                        current demands from other countries for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                        480 agreements in relation to the new authority likely to be available—I
                        understand requests on file amount to $2.5 billion whereas the prospective
                        new authority is only $1 billion—perhaps the selection of countries should
                        be based largely, if not exclusively, on the need for economic assistance
                        rather than on financial returns to the United States, and the sales
                        agreements should provide the maximum amount of economic assistance
                        authorized by the law. If this policy were adopted, it would be much more
                        difficult for other supplying countries to claim that <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 agreements were interfering with sales which they
                        otherwise could make.</p>
                    <p>I hope these observations are of some value to you. I shall be most happy to
                        discuss the problem with you personally or to follow up with further
                        discussions between our respective staffs.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>At the conclusion of an hour’s session with Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_AS1">Adams</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                            >Humphrey</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFA1"
                            >Seaton</persName>, it was decided to proceed with the recommendation
                        for new sliding scale tariffs on lead and zinc. It is planned to present
                        this program to the President during the course of the week and to bring it
                        up for Cabinet discussion on Friday if he approves.</p>
                    <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0265"/>
                    <p>During the discussion it was pointed out that Congress was determined to
                        legislate on this subject at this session regardless of the Administration’s
                        desires. The introduction of this legislation has been held in abeyance with
                        difficulty by the promise that the Administration program would be sent to
                        the Congress promptly. It was further pointed out that the President would
                        not be in a position to veto such legislation unless there was an
                        alternative Administration program providing immediate relief. A new Tariff
                        Commission study would not be sufficient as an alternative.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that such action seemed clearly in violation of the spirit of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, if not of its letter. It was
                        pointed out in return that if we should inform the Congress that they could
                        not legislate on this subject because of our obligations under the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, this would certainly be a mortal blow to
                        the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> and probably a mortal blow to next
                        year’s renewal of the Trade Agreement Act. Therefore, it was not deemed
                        practicable to make this argument to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>There was general consensus that Congress would desire to go considerably
                        beyond the proposition to be submitted by the Interior Department and would
                        only be held within bounds by the prospect of a veto for anything which
                        surpassed the Administration’s recommendations.</p>
                    <p>I was informed that as a result of my objections at the previous meeting the
                        proposed new tariff on fluorspar had been dropped from the program.</p>
                    <p>I then objected to the details of the Interior proposal, pointing out that it
                        was proposed to apply the new increases in a manner that seemed too abrupt.
                        I suggested that the additional tariffs be applied in two steps, rather than
                        all at once, using a graduated scale which, in the case of lead, would mean
                        applying half of the additional tariff when the price went below 16 cents,
                        and the remainder when the price went below 15 cents. This in contrast to
                        the Interior proposal to apply the whole additional tariff when the price
                        went below 16 cents. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName>
                        agreed to consider this and telephoned me later that the Interior Department
                        would accept this change.</p>
                    <p>On timing I found that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFA1"
                            >Seaton</persName> thinks he has a commitment to Senator Murray<note

                        Congress prior to June 1, and he proposes to brief the Republican leadership
                        on it next week. I pointed out the effect that any such information might
                        have on the Canadian election, and asked that every effort be made to
                        postpone action until at least June 10, the date of the Canadian election,
                        lest it be thought that the U.S. was acting in an <pb n="236"
                            xml:id="pg_236" facs="0266"/>unfriendly manner toward the present
                        Canadian Government. Governor <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Adams</persName>
                        was not in the room during this part of the discussion and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> said that he would see
                        what he could do, but he was not hopeful of being able to postpone the
                        matter until June 10th.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> (1) In view of the overpowering
                        political arguments in favor of an additional tariff on lead and zinc it is

                    <p>The Pres signed the wool recommendation but we have not put it out yet.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">On May 24, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> established a new tariff quota on woolen
                            fabrics which stipulated that the rates of duty on imports in excess of
                            14 million pounds, estimated to be roughly 5 percent of average domestic
                            production, would be 45 percent ad valorem instead of the lower rates
                            which would normally apply. The texts of the White House announcement
                            and the President’s letter of May 24, 1957, advising the Secretary of
                            the Treasury of his action are printed in Department of State <hi
                                rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 8, 1957, pp. 84–85.</note> A told
                        the Pres he would call the Sec because of the contrary view from State. The
                        overriding issue was statistics of the domestic wool industry which look
                        pretty bad. A mentioned the combat with the cotton people and how they want
                        to beat <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> and HR1 and take authority away.
                        We have to negotiate them out of business—according to them. The Sec said
                        they indict State for making recommendations and think we don’t see their
                        side. We are trying to make them see <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> is
                        an organization which will give them a broader base of considerations when
                        negotiations come up. A said on the basis of the jam we are in we are pushed
                        in reluctantly—he wants <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> so signed. The
                        Sec does not know if it makes a great <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237"
                            facs="0267"/>deal of difference whether Congress pulls down our trade
                        structure or we do it ourselves. A said it is one item. The Sec said it adds
                        on to lead and zinc and the cumulative effect will satisfy the world they
                        cannot depend on US markets. The whole purpose of our trade agreements is
                        being frustrated. The Sec went into a discourse on this and mentioned lead
                        and zinc. Under agreements we are not supposed to put duties on these unless
                        2 conditions prevail—there is a finding it is due to imports and unless some
                        compensating benefits to trade are off(?). A said if he were to give an
                        opinion re this he would think where things are so precarious it is better
                        to make a couple of mistakes than to risk completely this whole structure.
                        The Sec said we are throwing it away. Then A said that is strong. The Sec
                        said they indict State for not recommending as they want but we point out
                        what we consider foreign policy aspects and you decide knowing both sides.
                        It will be bad for Mexico, Peru, Australia and to some extent Canada. The
                        Sec said he told the Pres we support the Swiss watch thing—we tried for
                        voluntary importation restrictions on lead and zinc and so on—and this when
                        the country is enjoying prosperity.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador referred to recent press notices indicating that the United
                        States Government proposes to take some measures which will restrict imports
                        of lead and zinc. Recognizing that the matter is internal, he nevertheless
                        emphasized the adverse international results of such a move, citing
                        references made by President <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0268"
                            /><persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to the international
                        aspects in 1954, when attempts were made to raise import duties on these two
                            metals.<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">Regarding this issue, see memoranda

                        of the President’s interest on that occasion a stockpiling program was
                        initiated which saved the situation. Mexico has since cooperated with the
                        Administration’s recommendation to limit exports voluntarily. Should duties
                        now be increased or quotas established Mexico would find itself at a
                        distinct disadvantage with respect to other countries that had failed to
                        refrain from taking advantage of the measures adopted in 1954. Taken
                        together, monthly average exports of Mexican lead and zinc amounted in 1953
                        to 28.9 thousand tons, as against 24.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">On August

                            House Ways and Means Committees explaining why he had decided not to

                        thousand in 1956.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Tello mentioned the importance of lead and zinc to Mexico as two
                        of the five most valuable factors in its foreign commerce. Contrasting the
                        $831 million imports from the United States with United States purchases in
                        Mexico of only $404 million in 1956, he cited cotton policies already
                        adopted by the United States which resulted in losses for Mexico of some $96
                        million.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the continued applicability of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statement in 19543 that
                        restrictions on importations of lead and zinc would be of doubtful benefit
                        to the United States mining industry, he recalled that there were United
                        States smelting concerns which depended exclusively on Mexican imports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRRJ1">Rubottom</persName> explained that the steps
                        now being considered derive from public statements made by the President
                        promising to devise a long-term minerals program, and also from strong
                        domestic political pressures, especially the western minerals producing
                        States, calling for relief. The stockpiling program has resulted in glutting
                        the market to the point where domestic producers are in need of relief and
                        this program has also been very costly. While Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRRJ1">Rubottom</persName> himself has vigorously for some
                        time past given full expression to the various international factors
                        involved, it is nevertheless a fact that some defensive measures are going
                        to be taken. Just what shape these measures will assume is not yet known.
                        Referring to the marginal producers who would benefit from corrective steps,
                        he pointed out that other countries also had marginal producers who were
                        benefiting from the stockpiling program. Referring to decreases in imports
                        cited by the Ambassador, he noted information in his possession showing
                        increases in the value of lead and zinc imports by value since 1953; and
                        with respect to cotton, he cited United <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239"
                            facs="0269"/>States estimates of Mexico’s losses as not exceeding some
                        $12 million. He assured the Ambassador that despite the Department’s
                        sympathetic view of the problems to be created for other producing
                        countries, he was unable to make any hopeful statement regarding the outcome
                        of the consideration now being given to a difficult domestic situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Tello</persName> repeated his assurance that Mexican producers
                        had not taken undue advantage of the stockpiling program, as established by
                        his figures, and asked that this be taken into account along with Mexico’s
                        continuing deficit in foreign trade, and the fact that two very important
                        exports will be affected, to say nothing of curtailment of subsidiary
                        production of gold and silver. His immediate interest, however, is to
                        ascertain just what measures will be taken, either increase in duties or
                        establishment of quotas, or a combination of the two, in order that his
                        Government may be informed as soon as possible. It will be necessary for him
                        to have appropriate information along these lines in order to prepare
                        adequate statements in support of his Government’s interests. Note No.

                    <p>The Ambassador said he was sorry to have to take the occasion of his initial
                        courtesy call on Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> to express his Government’s
                            <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>serious concern about the
                        Administration’s decision to recommend to the Congress increases in the lead
                        and zinc tariffs. He left a note (copy attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2"
                            >Not printed.</note> which also expresses concern about a reported
                        decision to reinstate the barter program for imports of these and other
                        metals in exchange for surplus grain. In the Canadian view both sets of
                        measures would “cause serious damage to important trade and economic
                        interests and would be bound to have a profound effect on Canadian-United
                        States trade relations.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> said we would check on the status of the
                        barter program but that, in any case, he was certain that any decisions with
                        respect to it were unrelated to the Cabinet decision to recommend additional
                        duties on lead and zinc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> went into some detail on the background of
                        the pending Administration action on lead and zinc. He noted that the
                        President, in vetoing a bill relating to minerals in 1955 and again in a
                        message this year, promised that the Administration would come up with a
                        program of assistance for the domestic minerals industry, and directed the
                        Department of the Interior to develop such a program. Mention was also made
                        of the Tariff Commission’s recommendations in 1954 for increased duties
                        under the escape clause and the fact that these were not adopted by the
                        President. Instead, an effort was made at voluntary controls and a program
                        of stockpiling was adopted. Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> pointed to the
                        recent situation in the market for lead and zinc and the strong political
                        pressures that have been building up to assist the domestic industry. The
                        tariff action to be recommended will be the smallest increase believed
                        necessary to stabilize the domestic market and provide the required
                        protection. In fact, the recommendation to the Congress will be in the form
                        of a sliding scale duty under which even the existing duty would be removed
                        if the price rises above a certain point.</p>
                    <p>After sketching the background of the Administration’s decision, Mr.
                            <persName>Dillon</persName> took up the point in the Canadian memorandum
                        that the proposed measures “would constitute a serious impairment of
                        contractual obligations by the United States.” He noted that there were
                        provisions in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> which would permit
                        this action to be taken: Article XXVIII which would allow the unilateral
                        withdrawal of concessions on January 1, 1958; and Article XIX, the escape
                        clause provision, under which concessions may be withdrawn under
                        circumstances of serious injury to domestic producers. He also noted the
                        legal possibility of such withdrawals taking place prior to January 1, 1958
                        under the “special circumstance” procedures of the declaration of March 10,
                        1955.</p>
                    <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> explained that we fully understood our
                        obligation under those provisions to negotiate and to seek to provide
                        compensatory concessions. If this were not possible, we recognized the right
                        of affected countries to make retaliatory withdrawals of concessions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> conceded the point made in the Canadian
                        memorandum that the United States would not have enough authority left to
                        offer adequate compensation. In the circumstances he saw one of three
                        possible ways of restoring the balance of concessions between the United
                        States and Canada. One possibility would be to wait until the Trade
                        Agreements Act is renewed next year in the hope that an adequate basis for
                        compensation would be provided in the new authority. The second possibility
                        would be for the Canadians to withdraw equivalent concessions. The third
                        possibility would be some combination of the first two. One consideration
                        Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> felt the Canadians should keep in mind is
                        that the proposed action on lead and zinc has an important bearing on the
                        prospects for renewal next year of the Trade Agreements Act. If the
                        Administration could not or did not act on lead and zinc, many votes would
                        be lost on the reciprocal trade issue next year.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian Ambassador stated that, however arguable the economic impact of
                        the proposed measures may be, they were politically a major step backward in
                        the relations between the two countries. Moreover, the prospect of
                        reciprocal withdrawals was not something the Canadians would look forward
                        to. He also questioned the proposed action in terms of hemispheric defense
                        considerations, but Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> noted that we were not
                        trying to relate this action in any way to considerations of strategic
                        necessity. Mr. <persName>Ritchie</persName> noted, nevertheless, that the
                        action could have strategic consequences in terms of its effect on the
                        sources of supply that the United States would have to rely on in an
                        emergency. The Ambassador stated that the proposed action is particularly
                        troublesome when added to the other problems in Canadian-United States trade
                        relations, notably those arising from our surplus disposal program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> assured the Ambassador that throughout the
                        interagency discussions on this subject the Department has been much
                        concerned about the effect of the proposed action on our relations with
                        Canada and had brought this aspect of the matter to the attention of the
                        Cabinet. He indicated that the views contained in the Canadian memorandum
                        would be given further consideration but he was not hopeful regarding any
                        change in the decision.</p>

                        <item>New Increased Duties and/or Excise Taxes on Imports of Lead and
                            Zinc</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Tariff Commission in 1954 found that lead and zinc were being imported
                        into the United States in such increased quantities as to cause serious
                        injury to the domestic mining industry. To remedy this injury the Commission
                        recommended increased rates of duty. The rates recommended were 50 percent
                        above those existing on January 1, 1945, the maximum permissible under trade
                        agreements legislation.</p>
                    <p>The President at that time took no action on the Tariff Commission’s
                        recommendations, but instead instituted stockpile programs to help domestic
                        producers. The President’s 1954 announcement also contemplated voluntary
                        action by the exporting countries to limit shipments so as not to take
                        advantage of the U.S. stockpiling programs. Consultations were held with the
                        major exporting countries at that time. The voluntary plan proved
                        unsuccessful and imports of lead are up approximately 16 percent over 1954
                        levels and zinc up approximately 40 percent. Increases in imports have come
                        from almost all exporting countries.</p>
                    <p>U.S. stockpiling programs are now approaching completion and, as part of a
                        new long-range minerals program to be submitted to the Congress, the
                        Administration is recommending that new excise taxes or a combination of
                        duties and excise taxes be applied to imports of lead and zinc. The new
                        rates will be approximately 3¢ per pound on lead and 2¢ per pound on zinc.
                        These are slightly higher than the rates recommended by the Tariff
                        Commission in 1954. It is proposed that the new rates be applicable on a
                        sliding scale depending on the price of each metal. Proportional increases
                        will also be recommended for lead and zinc ores and concentrates and lead
                        and zinc semi-manufactures.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, not known what action the Congress will take on the
                        Administration’s proposals. The recent declines in lead and zinc prices
                        have, however, precipitated considerable demands from producers, from labor
                        and from the Congress for some kind of action to curb imports.</p>

                    <p>Representatives of the major producing countries in Washington have been
                        informed of the Government’s intentions. The Canadian, Australian, Belgian
                        and Peruvian representatives, the principal producing countries which are
                        also Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, were
                        informed that the United States recognized that it had commitments under the
                        Agreement with respect to tariff treatment to be afforded these products.
                        Pending enactment of legislation, however, it has not been determined under
                        which article of the Agreement the United States would act.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> opened the conference
                        by stating that he had made a review of the situation on the <persName
                            corresp="#p_HRC1">Hill</persName> with respect to the ratification of
                        the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> and had found things in bad shape.
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Jere Cooper</persName>, Chairman of
                        the Ways and Means Committee, had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> that he was unwilling to ask the Committee to report
                        the ratification instrument out unless a majority of Republican members of
                        the Committee were willing to vote for it. A count taken by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> indicated that not more than four
                        Republicans would be willing to vote in favor and that there was some doubt
                        in the minds of one or two of these four.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> went on to explain that
                        antagonism to the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> in itself was not the
                        major consideration. The real question involved was whether or not next year
                        the Congress would renew HR–1, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> said that he had talked to
                        Congressman Simpson of Pennsylvania who seemed to be the key Republican on
                        the Committee with regard to the Reciprocal Trade <pb n="244"
                            xml:id="pg_244" facs="0274"/>Agreements and Simpson had explained to him
                        that the unpopularity was due to two causes: (1) the feeling that in the
                        administration of the Act the Department of State had too large a voice and
                        that consequently the plight of some industries in the U.S. when weighed
                        against international considerations were not given sufficient importance;
                        and (2) in the fifteen times when the Tariff Commission had recommended
                        protective action for American industry, the President had approved only
                        four times and rejected the recommendations on eleven occasions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> then explained that he felt
                        that only some advance agreement with Mr. <persName>Simpson</persName> and
                        his colleagues in regard to the set up of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
                        Act for next year could save the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> as well
                        as the Act itself. Such a trade might include changes in the administration
                        of the Act which would give the Department of Commerce a larger voice in the
                        recommendations, a stricter adherence by the President of the Tariff
                        Commission’s recommendations, and a more precise definition with respect to
                        the determining of “injury” to U.S. business interests.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> then asked if Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> cared to comment on this
                        situation. The Secretary stated that he was deeply disappointed that the
                        exporters from the U.S. whose total volume of exports reached four times the
                        proportion of dutiable imports were not more vocal in supporting the
                        Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. The figures on the trend of our whole
                        foreign trade position favored the continuing increase in foreign trade with
                        very important export markets, but that generally speaking little support
                        had been received from this source. He also stated that generally speaking
                        foreign nations preferred a fixed quota rather than tariff increases because
                        the former allowed them at least to count on a definite proportion of our
                        market whereas the latter, in order to be really effective, was likely to
                        shut them out entirely. Before the end of the discussion, the Secretary had
                        to leave the conference and Deputy Under Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had joined the group. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> and Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> were asked to reduce
                        their suggestions for a possible trade into very specific terms so that we
                        might have an opportunity of examining them.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Addendum</hi></p>
                    <p>Since this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName>
                        called Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and
                        stated that he had heard of the discussion. He likewise said that he had
                        discussed this same matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"
                            >Weeks</persName> and had made the same recommendation, namely, that the
                        suggested agreement with Congressman Simpson should be outlined in detail
                        before further discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1"
                            >Randall</persName> did, however, indicate that he <pb n="245"
                            xml:id="pg_245" facs="0275"/>thought perhaps some trade would be
                        necessary if both the <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss> this year and the
                        Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act next year were to be saved.</p>

                                fight very hard for our exports, because we cannot live without
                                them, and when one of our trades really makes a good show it is
                                pretty disheartening to be cut down in this rough way. I do not know
                                whether this decision is perpetual or whether it could be reversed
                                in due course. It makes me feel very pessimistic about the growth of
                                liberal concepts in the world. If countries with enormous surpluses

                            <item>The proposal has already been made public without a prior finding

                                rather than as an emergency step to prevent serious injury in
                                immediate circumstances.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>It would be difficult to tie the present action to the escape
                                clause findings of the Tariff Commission of three years ago, which
                                were rejected by the President.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Presumably some sort of finding of injury (if the facts warrant
                                it, which we don’t yet know) could be presented to the Congress by
                                the Executive branch. But the failure in this single instance to use
                                the Tariff Commission, which is assigned the responsibility for
                                serious injury recommendations, would raise questions in Congress
                                and elsewhere.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>For these reasons, the use of the escape clause route (1) would make our
                        presentation in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> much more difficult
                        than if we were to use Article XXVIII, and (2) might open the door to
                        pressures on the Administration to handle other products in the same way.
                        There would also be criticism that the Executive is circumventing the Tariff
                        Commission, so far as the finding of serious injury is concerned, contrary
                        to the intent of Congress as expressed in the Trade Agreement Act.</p>
                    <p>As you will see, the problem here is created not by the language of our
                        international obligations under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>—which
                        is in fairly general terms—but by the consistent administrative practice
                        which we have built up in attempting to fulfill those obligations in good
                        faith. If the administrative practice is suddenly breached in an important
                        case, the question of good faith will inevitably arise.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Since the enactment of Public Law 480 on July 10, 1954, surplus agricultural
                        commodities have been disposed of in the following amounts: under Title I
                        (sale for foreign currencies), some $2 billion ($3 billion at <gloss
                            target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> cost); under Title II (primarily for relief
                        purposes), <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0277"/>$320 million; and under
                        Title III (for numerous relief purposes and barter), $279 million.</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of foreign relations <gloss target="#t_POL1">P.L</gloss>.
                        480 has its good and bad sides. On the favorable side it is to be noted that
                        shipments for relief have gained good will in recipient countries without
                        arousing resentment on the part of other exporting countries. Not only are
                        agricultural commodities supplied recipient countries, but the local
                        currencies generated are put to many uses serving U.S. foreign policy
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>Title I transactions have contributed to the basic food supply of numerous
                        countries permitting them to use their own currencies for the purchases.
                        This has enabled them to combat inflation and temporarily to balance their
                        international accounts. Local currencies have been used with a few
                        exceptions on a loan basis to promote economic development, and on a grant
                        basis to bolster the defense capabilities of our allies. These currencies
                        have also been used to pay U.S. obligations and to finance various U.S.
                        programs. Good will has been gained in many recipient countries and the
                        commercial market for U.S. agricultural products may possibly have been
                        broadened.</p>
                    <p>On the unfavorable side the following points should be noted.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Some countries such as Pakistan, Spain, and Turkey have used Title I
                            programs to escape from the consequences of poor economic policies. Thus
                            they have avoided taking measures they otherwise would have had to
                            undertake in order to set their economies in order.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>There is a danger that programs can be developed beyond the capacity
                            of recipient countries to carry forward with their own resources,
                            especially over any protracted period of time. After the commodities are
                            consumed the debt remains. The burden should not be beyond the capacity
                            of a country to repay, or to make it dependent on U.S. charity due to a
                            temporary program.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The program involves state trading, dumping and export subsidies on a
                            large scale and violates the principles of trade we urge on other
                            countries.</item>

                        <item>Sales under Title I and barter under Title III have displaced
                            commercial sales of the U.S. and of friendly competing countries and
                            have placed a serious strain on our relations with some of our best
                            friends and staunchest supporters such as Canada. Most other nations
                            which export agricultural products are dependent upon such exports for
                            the bulk of their foreign exchange earnings and cannot compete with
                            concessional sales from the U.S. They have, however, been patient
                            because they regard <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 as a
                            temporary expedient.</item>

                        That is why we have opposed all efforts at making it a permanent

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Harold</persName></hi>:
                        [Here follows brief discussion of the disarmament negotiations currently in
                        progress.]</p>
                    <p>Of course I can understand your disappointment about the restrictions that we
                        finally had to put on the import of wool textiles. I must explain, however,
                        one phase of the problem that our friends should clearly understand.</p>
                    <p>This Administration stands firmly and squarely for liberalized and greater
                        flow of trade among the nations of the free world. We have fought long and
                        earnestly for acceptance of this doctrine in this country and, in executing
                        the law, have time and again declined to listen to the special pleas of
                        specialized industries in this country in order to promote the general
                        concept of reciprocity and freer trade.</p>
                    <p>But while doing this we can never forget that the Congress has granted
                        authority to the Executive for making reciprocal trade treaties only on a
                        temporary basis. Once in a while there arises a case that has such great
                        popular appeal that to decline flatly to give any of the relief contemplated
                        by the law could easily result in a return of this country to its former
                        high protection policy.</p>
                    <p>It is the task of deciding between these immediate and long-term damages to
                        our friends—and to ourselves—that is difficult. I and some of my trusted
                        associates spend many hours of hard study on such questions. If I should
                        approve every recommendation made to me by the Federal Tariff Commission—a
                        body whose responsibility it is to see that justice is done to American
                        industry—the total effect over the past four and a half years would have
                        been almost <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0279"/>catastrophic, and we
                        would be totally defeated in the effort to promote trade.</p>
                    <p>So I beg of you that you try to understand the situation. I shall continue to
                        fight as hard as I know how for the concept of freer and greater trade. But
                        sometimes I am impelled, on such a wide front as that on which I operate, to
                        beat a local and—I hope—temporary retreat.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the German decision to purchase an American
                        instead of a British tank for the German army.]</p>
                    <p>I thoroughly enjoy and appreciate your letters.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Current Agricultural Problems</hi>—Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName>, prior to a detailed presentation on
                        agricultural surpluses, noted that farm prices and income are slightly
                        better than a year ago, that markets continue to expand, that much of the
                        improvement resulted from costly new Federal programs, and that Agriculture
                        is anxious to secure further legislation making price support formulas more
                        flexible. He thought that Agriculture might next January urge a special
                        message by the President on this matter.</p>
                    <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0281"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> presented a series of charts
                        concerning surpluses in particular crops, <gloss target="#t_CCC1"
                            >CCC</gloss> disposal programs, exports generally and specifically under
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480, and use of foreign currencies.
                        He noted the favorable situation regarding upland cotton where the world
                        price still exceeds the US price after a large volume of US sales—all of
                        this contrary to the fears expressed, when the United States first went into
                        the world market, that the world price would fall drastically.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> reported the definite
                        impression he secured during a recent world trip that foreign officials have
                        a growing tendency to regard <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 as a
                        permanent source of food supplies. He urged that efforts be made to clarify
                        the temporary nature of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> also made a detailed
                        presentation on the rigidity of the law governing price supports for cotton
                        and the requirement for taking action that will not be in the best interests
                        of cotton producers.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported the difficulty
                        experienced by the State Department in judging whether the advantages of
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 outweighed the disadvantages. He
                        reported also the concern of the Canadians who hope that <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 does not become permanent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> took note of the Senate
                        subcommittee hearings on <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and the
                        probability that <gloss target="#t_Sen1">Sen.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> will attempt to charge
                        negligence in fulfilling Title III concerning stockpiling. He stated the
                        question as being one of whether the United States had to acquire stockpile
                        items regardless of foreseeable needs or lack of needs. He saw hearings as
                        an effort to drive wedges between <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and
                        Agriculture. The President commented that the supplementary stockpile was
                        established primarily as a convenience for Agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_SFA1">Seaton</persName> commented on letters
                        received by him and Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> urging study of
                        possible expansion of the barter program. The President commented on his
                        long standing belief that it was desirable to trade surpluses subject to
                        spoilage for materials, especially minerals, not subject to spoilage. He
                        recognized the difficulty of carrying on such a program at a time when
                        Treasury is having difficulty raising funds. Sec. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> noted also that barter arrangements
                        frequently served only to replace cash sales.</p>

                    <p>20. For State and Agriculture.</p>
                    <p>today informed Embassy that attitude of present government toward US wheat
                        disposal policies more bitter than that of previous government and that some
                        form high-level representation to US is contemplated.</p>
                    <p>Under circumstances increased volume of official statements and press items
                        critical of US disposal policies can be expected. Such statements and items
                        undoubtedly will continue to give unfair and biased picture of US
                        position.</p>
                    <p>I believe there is need for authoritative US statement designed put our wheat
                        disposal policies in perspective and correct unfair and biased press

                            411.0041/7–1057)</note> There is risk of course that such statement
                        might harm our future relations with new Canadian Government. Certainly we
                        cannot afford establish pattern of conducting Canadian-US relations by press
                        release, particularly in absence passage sufficient time for establishment
                        informal personal relationships between new cabinet members and their
                        opposite US numbers.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding foregoing risk, occasion of signature bill extending <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 provides unique opportunity for President
                        to make objective statement regarding surplus wheat disposal policies
                        stressing humanitarian and long-term developmental aspects of <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480. Such statement might invite other
                        nations, including Canada, who are in position to do so to join US in this
                        work. Such statement I believe should admit that some damage has been done
                        to export markets of free countries, although possibly not to extent that
                        some countries feel. It would need to be drafted with utmost care to avoid
                        starting new barrage of Canadian criticism.</p>
                    <p>Wheat situation has, in my opinion, considerable potential for damage to
                        overall US-Canadian relations. I would appreciate your reaction to this
                        suggested countermeasure. Embassy recognizes it may not be practicable for
                        reasons of timing final congressional <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253"
                            facs="0283"/>action on bill. If approved, statement would I presume be
                        drafted in Washington but Embassy would appreciate opportunity see and
                        comment on draft prior its final form.</p>

                        EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Background</hi></p>
                    <p>On January 16, 1957, the Japanese Government announced a five year program
                        for the control of cotton textile exports to the United States. This program
                        was developed after months of discussions between United States and Japanese
                        officials. The Japanese set an over-all annual ceiling of 235 million square
                        yards for cotton fabrics and cotton manufactured goods. Ceilings were
                        established for 5 major groups of cotton manufactures and for a number of
                        specific items, such as ginghams, velveteens, blouses, shirts, brassieres,
                        pillowcases, dish towels, etc. Provision was also made for consultation
                        between the two Governments, should new areas of concentration of imports
                        develop in the cotton textile field.</p>
                    <p>The voluntary action by the Japanese Government was the culmination of a
                        series of efforts by the Administration to meet the growing problem of the
                        adverse impact of low-cost imports on our domestic textile industry, in a
                        manner consistent with the basic foreign trade policy of the United States
                        and with the maintenance of friendly relations with Japan. As a result of
                        the program and the discussions leading to it, escape clause actions on
                        blouses and ginghams were withdrawn, and the recommendation by the Tariff
                        Commission for a sharp increase in velveteen duties was not accepted.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Industry Attitude</hi></p>
                    <p>The domestic textile industry, as a whole, has welcomed the program as a
                        stabilizing influence on the textile market, but always with the caveat that
                        its success would depend on effective implementation. The one important
                        exception to the favorable industry response has been the attitude of the
                        Southern Garment Manufacturers Association. This group sponsored the

                        similar laws in other states. They have continued to withhold any
                        indications of support although they have generally refrained from overt
                        public attack on the program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1"

                            >McClellan</persName> made special efforts this spring, including a
                        meeting with the Board of Directors in Atlanta, to convey to the Southern
                        Garment Manufacturers Association a better understanding of the situation.
                        In these efforts they were assisted by leaders of the American Cotton
                        Manufacturers Institute and the National Cotton Council.</p>
                    <p>Though the textile industry has responded favorably to the Government’s
                        efforts with respect to Japanese cotton textile imports, it has continued to
                        oppose <gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> and the Trade Agreements Program as it is presently
                        administered and operated. Industry leaders, however, are giving careful
                        thought to specific recommendations for what they would consider to be
                        improvements in the legislation.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Implementation—United States</hi></p>
                    <p>Both the Japanese and the United States Governments have adopted new measures
                        to help the control program work. The United States (Commerce and Treasury)
                        has revised completely its statistical classification of cotton textile
                        imports. With this new classification and the import procedures agreed upon
                        between Commerce and Treasury, a more precise identification of cotton
                        textile imports will be possible. More detailed and useful data on imports
                        of cotton textiles from all countries will be published monthly. These will
                        show, among other things, United States imports of the items for which the
                        Japanese have assigned specific quotas. A procedure has been arranged under
                        which Customs Appraisers will verify the accuracy of importers’
                        classification of cotton textiles. This should reduce the differences
                        between Japanese export statistics and United States import statistics. The
                        examination process by the Appraisers will cover all cotton textile imports
                        for the first three months of the program (July–September 1957). After that
                        the examination will be on a 10 percent sample basis.</p>
                    <p>Customs will also endeavor to identify all cases in which unauthorized
                        transshipment is suspected. Information about certain <pb n="255"
                            xml:id="pg_255" facs="0285"/>of these cases will be passed on to the
                        Japanese Government for appropriate remedial action. The Census Bureau will
                        also undertake a comparison and reconciliation of Japanese export and United
                        States import statistics. This should provide further indication of the
                        degree of success of the program and may also reveal possible flaws in
                        enforcement.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Implementation—Japan</hi></p>
                    <p>For their part the Japanese have instituted a comprehensive export licensing
                        system which operates and is enforced both on the governmental level and
                        also on the trade association level. A principal purpose of the licensing
                        system is to prevent unauthorized transshipment to the United States. For
                        the type of goods which are likely to be consumed in the United States, the
                        sailing route of the vessel, the financial arrangements, and import policy
                        of reported country of destination are checked. Also, in some cases a
                        delivery verification certificate is required to be filed with the
                        Government. Violators of the regulations may be refused further export
                        allocations.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese Government is preparing special reports on shipments to the
                        United States under the control program. However, the regular statistical
                        export classifications have not been revised. This may lead to some
                        confusion.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese statement of control procedures has been submitted only recently
                        and is still being studied by the United States Government agencies.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. Trends of Shipments under the
                            Program</hi></p>
                    <p>1957 statistics from United States and Japanese sources are available to date
                        only for the first four months of the year. The United States import
                        classification revision became effective as of July 1, so that data for the
                        earlier months of the year are not entirely adequate. However, it is clear
                        from the available data that imports of cotton products from Japan from
                        January through April 1957 were well below the comparable period of 1956. In
                        part this may be due to the complications in Japan involved in setting up
                        control procedures.</p>
                    <p>On an over-all basis, United States imports of cotton textiles from Japan are
                        reported at $23 million in the first four months of 1957 compared with $33
                        million in the same period of 1956, a drop of 30 percent. The biggest drop
                        has occurred in the cloth group for which imports during January-April were
                        more than 50 percent below the first four months of 1956. In the apparel
                        field, shipments <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0286"/>from Japan of
                        sport shirts, dress shirts and knit T shirts in the first four months are
                        well below the annual rate which the quotas permit.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of present trends and of reports from Japan, it is probable that
                        the cloth quota may not be taken up in full, but the quotas for made-up
                        goods probably will be.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">6. Changes in Quotas</hi></p>
                    <p>On July 9, 1957, the Japanese Embassy advised that the Japanese Government
                        had decided to take advantage of the provision in the program which states,
                        “within the over-all annual total, the limit for any Group may be exceeded
                        by not more than 10 percent.” The Japanese propose to reduce Group I, cloth,
                        by 6.2 percent, to increase Group II, certain made-up goods, and Group III,
                        woven apparel, by 6 percent each and increase Group V, miscellaneous, by 10
                        percent. These shifts are consistent with the program.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">7. Special Problems</hi></p>
                    <p>In the process of preparing and putting into effect the revised United States
                        import procedures a number of problems have come to light.</p>
                    <p>First, it has been found that the definition of “gingham” used by the
                        Japanese for the control program excludes “gingham stripes”. This is at
                        variance with generally accepted commercial practice in Japan, the United
                        States and other countries as well. The Japanese contend that their
                        definition was submitted in their original proposal during the 1956
                        discussions. Such a definition was included in their submission but no
                        special note was made of it, nor was it accepted by the United States side.
                        There is no definition of gingham in the final program. All during the
                        discussions the Japanese stressed the importance of adhering to accepted
                        commercial standards.</p>
                    <p>Preliminary discussions have been started with the Japanese on this matter.
                        They have been informed that the United States takes a serious view of the
                        matter because “gingham” is one of the sensitive items on which the success
                        of the entire program will depend.</p>
                    <p>A second problem, which has come to light in the course of a series of
                        discussions with Customs personnel at New York early in July, relates to
                        transshipments. A number of cases have been found in which significant
                        quantities of blouses and ginghams have reached the United States even
                        though licensed by the Japanese for other destinations (Panama, Switzerland,
                        United Kingdom). These cases are indicative of some of the devices which may
                        be resorted to by certain traders. They also cast some doubt on the
                        effectiveness of the Japanese transshipment controls. The Japanese Embassy
                        has already been advised of these cases. It is of interest to note that one
                            <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0287"/>series of these cases was
                        called to our attention by the Japanese who asked us to determine whether
                        the shipments in question had actually been landed in the United States.</p>
                    <p>A few other relatively minor developments, such as an upsurge of corduroy
                        apparel imports early in the year, were also informally brought to the
                        attention of the Japanese. The Japanese expressed appreciation at receiving
                        this information.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">8. Discriminatory State Textile
                        Laws</hi></p>
                    <p>At the time of the establishment of the program the Japanese Government in a
                        note indicated that it expected that the United States would take all
                        feasible steps to eliminate discriminatory state textile legislation, such
                        as that in Alabama and South Carolina. The Justice Department still has
                        under consideration a proposal to take legal action against the States in
                        question. Various efforts by textile industry leaders to obtain repeal have
                        not thus far been successful. On the other hand, however, efforts to enact
                        such laws in Georgia and Connecticut were defeated.</p>
                    <p>The seriousness with which the Japanese view these State laws is indicated by
                        the fact that Prime Minister Kishi<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">Japanese Prime
                            Minister Nobosuke Kishi visited the United States June 17–21.</note>
                        raised the issue during his recent Washington visit.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">9. Side Effects of the Program</hi></p>
                    <p>The Japanese voluntary control program for cotton textiles has led to demands
                        from other domestic industries and from Congressmen that similar procedures
                        be followed for other commodities affected by import competition. In the
                        case of wool fabrics and other wool products, the New England Congressional
                        delegation in both Houses has been particularly active to this end.
                        Considerable pressure has also been exerted for quotas or voluntary
                        agreements with respect to plywood and stainless steel flatware. Thus far
                        the Administration response has been that the cotton textile situation was
                        “exceptional”, in that the usual remedies, such as escape clause procedure,
                        were not feasible and that other problems must be examined and resolved on
                        the basis of the particular circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Except for Hong Kong, there is no indication thus far that other nations have
                        sought to take advantage of the existence of Japanese controls by increasing
                        their shipments to the United States. With respect to Hong Kong, there has
                        been a very sharp increase in shipments of low cost shirts, largely flannel,
                        to the United States. These appear to be shirts manufactured in Hong Kong
                        from locally produced or Japanese fabrics. The Japanese have been very much
                            <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0288"/>concerned about the increase of
                        Hong Kong shirt shipments to the United States because they feel that Hong
                        Kong is capitalizing on their controls. They are also concerned lest it be
                        interpreted in the United States as an evasion of the Japanese control
                        system. As a consequence, the Japanese are reported to be screening
                        carefully and limiting shipments to Hong Kong of fabrics which might be used
                        in production of shirts for the American market.</p>
                    <p>The increase in Hong Kong shipments has been sharp enough in recent months so
                        that a demand from United States industry for limitations of Hong Kong
                        shipments would not be surprising. This situation is being watched
                        carefully.</p>

                        regard to the disposal, the State Department is given that task.<note n="4"

                        other responsibilities under the Act, such as the holding and disposal of
                        local currencies, are allocated to other Departments and administration

                    <p>The new law should become effective any day. There have now accumulated
                        requests for these surplus agricultural commodities totaling $3,600,000,000.
                        We have made commitments to Poland and Pakistan totaling approximately
                        $150,000,000. I have suggested that no further commitments be made until we
                        know just where we are with regard to future policy.</p>
                    <p>The disposal of surplus agricultural commodities is now a tool of foreign
                        policy of almost equal importance with the Mutual Security Act. For the
                        underdeveloped countries, it is much the most effective medium whereby local
                        capital formation for economic development can be obtained.</p>

                    <p>Assistant Secretary Kearns reviewed briefly the efforts which have been made
                        by the Department of Commerce to obtain voluntary repeal of the laws in
                        those two States which require the posting of signs by establishments which
                        sell Japanese textiles. These efforts have been made by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>, former Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName>Kilborne</persName>, working through representatives of the
                        textile and other industries in Alabama and South Carolina. Mr.
                            <persName>Kearns</persName> said that these efforts had not been
                        successful. He said that although the interested people in those States were
                        willing to permit the laws to remain unenforced, it would be impossible to
                        get the proponents of the laws to reverse themselves so soon after their
                        enactment (1956). It was his and Mr. <persName>Kilborne</persName>’s opinion
                        that repeal would probably be unobtainable for two or three years. Mr.
                            <persName>Kilborne</persName> believed that if we were patient the laws
                        would be repealed in time. He added that it was the opinion of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> of the American Cotton
                        Manufacturers Institute that it would be a matter of several years before
                        repeal could be obtained. Mr. <persName>Kearns</persName> said he believed
                        legal action by the Federal Government at this time would have unfortunate
                        effects domestically and might adversely affect current negotiations on
                        Federal–State relations. He wondered if the Japanese Ambassador understood
                        that these laws were, in fact, not enforced.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kearns</persName> was informed that the Ambassador, as well as
                        the Prime Minister and other Japanese officials and members of the Japanese
                        textile industry had been informed of this fact.</p>
                    <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0291"/>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that he believed the existence of these laws was
                        disturbing to the Japanese regardless of their enforcement. He pointed out
                        that foreign governments consider the mere existence of such laws to be a
                        threat since they can be enforced at any time. He anticipated that we would
                        hear more from the Japanese early next year if no progress had been made
                        toward securing elimination of the laws. The Acting Secretary noted that the
                        legislatures of some of the States meet only biennially and asked whether
                        the legislatures of Alabama and South Carolina would meet in 1958. It was
                        agreed that this information should be promptly ascertained.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary requested that the Department of Commerce further
                        explore the possibility of obtaining repeal of these laws and that the
                        matter be reviewed again by the two Departments in the Fall. If efforts to
                        obtain voluntary repeal of these laws are unsuccessful the Acting Secretary
                        believed that it would be necessary to request the Attorney General to take
                        legal action seeking their invalidation, but he agreed with Mr.
                            <persName>Kearns</persName> that it would be desirable if this could be
                        avoided. He emphasized the serious problem presented by the continued
                        existence of these laws, regardless of their enforcement, pointing out that
                        permitting these laws to remain on the books in violation of our Treaty of
                        Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with Japan<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2"
                            >See <ref target="#d60fn3">footnote 3, Document 60</ref>.</note>
                        constituted an invitation to other States to pass laws of any sort without
                        regard to our treaty obligations generally. He believed that the U.S.
                        textile industry had a great responsibility in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Kilborne</persName> said that, with the exception of the
                        Southern Garment Manufacturers Association, the textile industry was anxious
                        to have these laws removed. Their, efforts had been successful in preventing
                        the passage of a similar law in Georgia, but Mr.
                            <persName>Kilborne</persName> doubted that they had been instrumental in
                        the defeat of the proposed legislation in Connecticut. He pointed out,
                        however, that in the case of Alabama and South Carolina the problem was now
                        in an area over which the textile industry had no control.</p>
                    <p>In reply to the Acting Secretary’s question Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSD1"
                            >Metzger</persName> said that although in other respects the two laws
                        were identical, the penalty in one case included imprisonment as well as a
                        fine, while in the other the only penalty was a fine. He added that in his
                        opinion the two laws were unconstitutional on two scores: they represented
                        State regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, a field reserved to
                        Congress under the Constitution, and which Congress occupied by the
                        enactment of marking legislation under the Tariff Act of 1930;<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d101fn3">Public Law 361, enacted June 17, 1930; for text, see 46
                            Stat. (pt. 1) 590.</note> and they are in violation of the Treaty of
                        Friendship, Commerce and <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0292"/>Navigation
                        with Japan, and consequently invalid under the supremacy clause.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Tyson</persName> pointed out that the continued existence of
                        these laws raised serious problems for the U.S. since it casts doubt on the
                        ability and willingness of the U.S. to enforce its treaty obligations
                        generally, it weakens the U.S. position in seeking corrective action when
                        treaty commitments are violated by the Japanese and it gives the Japanese an
                        excuse for imposing discriminatory restrictions against American products.
                        It was pointed out that in this context Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had expressed concern over the
                        existence of these laws.</p>
                    <p>With respect to South Carolina, the Acting Secretary wondered if an approach
                        had been made to former Governor Byrnes.<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4"
                                ><persName>James F. Byrnes</persName>, Secretary of State July
                            1945–January 1947, and Governor of South Carolina 1951–1955.</note> He
                        believed that in view of his previous experience as Secretary of State, this
                        was a problem which Governor Byrnes would fully understand, and that his
                        influence might be more effective than that of the textile industry.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary Kearns agreed to explore further the possibility of
                        obtaining repeal and to be prepared to review the matter in the Fall. He
                        expressed the hope that the Department of State would consider approaching
                        Governor Byrnes.</p>

                    <p>Adverse reaction continues to grow daily, with increasing anti-US emphasis.
                        What is hardest for well-disposed Peruvians to understand is fact that
                        Department and President support increases. Fact that final Congressional

                        Peruvians are increasingly convinced that both our good neighbor and
                        commercial policies are fair weather ones which we are prepared to abandon
                        when they come into conflict with material interest of any powerful US
                        element. This is doing us serious damage on political plane and may well
                        have long-term adverse political effects as well as bringing about
                        retaliatory commercial action against US products.</p>
                    <p>I realize both extent of pressure in US and complexities of political picture
                        but do wish to point out again real damage to US national interest here
                        which any tariff increases on these metals will have Congressional passage
                        of tariff increases and failure to act on bills authorizing sale of
                        commercial vessels and loan of naval vessels will be badly received. Tariff
                        increases by administrative action if Congress does not act will be worse
                        unless some formula can be found such as that suggested by

                    <p>To determine the position of the Department with respect to a revised
                        proposal for increasing import taxes on lead and zinc, as approved by the
                        Senate Finance Committee on August 16.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background:</hi></p>
                    <p>On August 16 the Senate Finance Committee, by a vote of 11 to 2, amended a
                        bill dealing with the tariff on mica by adding to it an important
                        legislative proposal for increased duties on lead and zinc, at considerable
                        variance with the Administration lead and zinc proposal. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHF1">Byrd</persName> was quoted as having said that the new
                        legislation would not be reported out for Senate action until he obtained
                        the views of the Departments of State and Interior. The mica bill, H.R.
                        6894, had already passed the House of Representatives, and action by the
                        Senate to amend it by adding legislation on lead and zinc would throw the
                        two proposals into conference. (The mica bill is not controversial.)</p>
                    <p>On the same day, August 16, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means
                        Committee, Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Jere Cooper</persName>,
                        addressed a letter to the President in which he pointed out that the
                        President has ample authority under existing trade agreements legislation to
                        provide whatever relief he may deem necessary to the lead and zinc
                        industries, and also that the President can act more expeditiously in this
                        way than would be the case if the Administration’s proposal were adopted.
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> urged the President
                        personally to review the situation and the proposal submitted to Congress.
                        He said he was sure that the President would be convinced that he does have
                        ample authority, and that by-passing the existing provisions of the trade
                        agreements law would undermine the program. In his penultimate paragraph,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> suggests that, if the
                        President does not exercise his authority under the Trade Agreements Act,
                        the Congress “will be forced to study again the delegation of authority <pb
                            n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0295"/>made to you under the trade
                        agreements legislation”. Mr <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName>’s
                        last paragraph says that the other 14 Democrats on the committee concur with
                        him in the letter. (Copy of letter attached as Tab A.)<note n="2"

                    <p>On Saturday morning there was a White House conference of legislative experts
                        from various departments, and one of the items considered was the lead and
                        zinc legislation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJSII1">Hoghland</persName> was
                        present, and has informed me that the understanding of the meeting was that
                        the original Administration position on lead and zinc legislation would
                        continue to be supported in any response made to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHF1">Byrd</persName> or to Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName>. After the meeting I had a phone call
                        from Under Secretary of Interior <persName corresp="#p_CH1"
                            >Chilson</persName>, who asked for help from our people in drafting
                        appropriate responses. Officers of <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> worked
                        with Interior officers during the day, and gained the impression that there
                        was strong sentiment in the Interior Department towards acceptance of some
                        of the more important features of the legislation approved by the Senate
                        Finance Committee. The Department of Interior had an extensive conference on
                        Sunday, August 18, with the lead and zinc industry, and reported to us that
                        it had succeeded in obtaining agreement from the industry to a number of
                        improvements in the legislation as it was approved by the Senate Finance
                        Committee. Significant and important differences between the original
                        proposal and the Senate Finance Committee proposal, as it will be amended by
                        industry consent, nevertheless remain.</p>
                    <p>The most important difference is in the rates of duty. The maximum rate in
                        the original three-step proposal of the Administration was 1.8 cents for
                        zinc ore and 2 cents for zinc metal. The new proposal would establish rates
                        of 2.1 cents for zinc ore and 3 cents for zinc metal. The new proposed rate
                        on lead ore is 1/10 cents higher than the maximum rate in the Administration
                        proposal, and the 3 cents per pound on lead metal is the same. Furthermore,
                        the Administration proposal had the virtue of applying the maximum rates
                        only when the price of lead was below 15 cents and the price of zinc below
                        121/2 cents, with lower rates applied at higher prices. The new proposal
                        would immediately apply the full rate at the time the materials fell below
                        the target prices of 17 cents for lead and 141/2 cents for zinc. Thus the
                        sliding scale feature of the Administration bill has been completely lost in
                        the new legislation.</p>
                    <p>There is a fairly large number of lead and zinc products, with separate rates
                        for each, but nearly all of the business is done in lead and zinc ore and
                        metal. The increase of the zinc rate above that proposed by the
                        Administration, and the elimination of the three-step sliding scale
                        principle would mean that several friendly <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
                            facs="0296"/>countries which are now profoundly dismayed at the
                        Administration proposal would be still more seriously concerned. They would
                        consider the proposal far more onerous in its impact on their economies. (A
                        table showing the existing tariff, the Administration proposal, and the
                        Senate Finance Committee proposal is attached as Tab B.)<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d103fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>It is likely that the Department of Interior will, on the morning of Monday,
                        August 19, seek our agreement to the Senate Finance Committee proposal in a
                        modified form. The modifications, however, do not affect the main points set
                        forth above, and we believe that we should not concur with the Department of
                        Interior, and should insist that the Administration stick to its original
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>The letter from Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> to
                        the President occupies a secondary position in the eyes of the Department of
                        Interior which proposes that a reply go forward later in the week.<note

                            xml:id="pg_267" facs="0297"/>by the President that he felt badly that he
                        should ever have approved of the so-called Administration Bill on lead and
                        zinc. He told the Leadership that he would, of course, stand by his previous
                        decision but that he would not approve the so-called Industry Amendment to
                        the Mica Bill which jacked up the excise rates on these two metals above the
                        figure agreed to by the Administration. He also indicated that if no bill
                        came to him he would see that action was taken promptly under the Escape
                        Clause by the Tariff Commission and had been assured that the Tariff
                        Commission could act quite promptly so that from an industry point of view
                        there would be little to chose between the two actions since the
                        Administration Bill if enacted into legislation could not be implemented
                        until January. He did, however, indicate that under the Escape Clause relief
                        given to the industry would not be quite as great as under the
                        Administration Bill.</p>

                        7–8) in Washington exchanging views on current economic relations between

                        and dispelling certain misunderstandings which have arisen on economic
                        matters of concern to both countries, and laying the groundwork for
                        discussing individual problems through normal channels. A week earlier,
                        Canada played host at Mont Tremblant to a Commonwealth Finance Ministers
                        meeting. The most significant development at Mont Tremblant was the
                        Commonwealth decision to hold a Commonwealth trade and economic conference
                        next year. Also of interest was <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chancellor

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Background</hi> The US-Canadian meeting in Washington,
                        October 7-8, was the third in a series of meetings of the Joint US-Canadian
                        Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs, which had met previously in March
                        1954 and September 1955.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">Reference is to the
                            meeting of September 26, 1955, described in <ref target="#d47">Document
                                47</ref>.</note> The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of
                        cordiality and frankness, and the US found it valuable to exchange views on
                        economic problems of mutual interest. Canadian officials have also expressed
                        the opinion that the session proved exceedingly useful.</p>
                    <p>Four cabinet members from each country composed the Joint Committee.
                        Representing the US were: Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> (Chairman), Treasury Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, Agriculture Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName>, and Commerce Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName>. Representing Canada were: Finance
                        Minister Fleming, External Affairs Secretary <persName>Smith</persName>,
                        Agriculture Minister Harkness, and Trade and Commerce Secretary
                        Churchill.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Committee was established to provide an opportunity for the cabinet
                        members primarily concerned with economic relations to meet informally from
                        time to time to exchange views and to examine developments of mutual
                        interest. This third meeting was especially valuable as it was the first
                        occasion since the Canadian election in June for a group of cabinet members
                        from the two countries to meet together. Some statements and actions during
                        the past few months on the part of the new Canadian officials have
                        occasioned us some concern—such as their criticism of US private investment
                        policies in Canada, an apparent advocacy of a shift of 15% in trade away
                        from the US, and new import restrictions. On their side the new Canadian
                        officials were not familiar with the background underlying some US policies,
                        particularly those relating to surplus agricultural disposals. These things
                        combined to create misunderstanding and concern. It is hoped that the
                        presentation of the US position has helped the Canadian visitors to view our
                        mutual problems with an improved perspective.</p>
                    <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0299"/>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Washington Discussions</hi> At the meeting a wide range of
                        subjects were examined, including domestic economic developments in both
                        countries, certain trade restrictions, US surplus disposal policies, US
                        investment in Canada, the possibility of US restrictions on lead and zinc
                        imports, and a number of other specific questions of special interest to
                        both sides. In the course of the review of current economic conditions, it
                        was recognized that the two countries have a deep and continuing interest in
                        each other’s economic stability and strength. In particular, representatives
                        of the two governments expressed their full accord on the importance of a
                        high level of business activity being maintained in their economies, and on
                        the need for growth that does not endanger either internal or external
                        economic stability.</p>
                    <p>Canadian Finance Minister Fleming, in his opening speech, dwelt on the
                        unsatisfactory situation of Canada’s trade balance, particularly with the
                        US. He expressed concern at the very high proportion of Canada’s external
                        trade which is taking place with the US and at the fact that Canada has been
                        importing much more from the US than it exported to the US. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that all
                        international transactions, invisible as well as visible, have to be taken
                        into account in considering a balance of payments. He drew attention to the
                        over-all strong balance-of-payments position of Canada and pointed out that
                        Canada’s trading deficit with the US had been accompanied by an inflow of
                        capital from the US, and that the rest of the deficit had been covered by
                        Canada’s trade surplus and investment inflows from other parts of the world.
                        In addition, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                        out that US leadership since World War II has been directly related to our
                        trade imbalance which was financed by our aid programs and other special
                        expenditures overseas. Canada as a close friend and ally certainly
                        recognized the importance of the US maintaining its position of leadership.
                        The US also stressed the dependability of the US economy both as a market
                        and as a supply source for Canada.</p>
                    <p>While the Canadian ministers maintained that US surplus disposal operations
                        have adversely affected Canadian wheat sales, the Canadians on the whole
                        were unexpectedly mild in their statements and made no specific proposals.
                        They emphasized particularly the harmful effects barter transactions have
                        had on commercial marketings of all exporting countries, including Canada
                        and the US. The US members affirmed to the Canadian ministers their
                        intention in all surplus disposal activities to avoid, insofar as possible,
                        interfering with normal commercial marketings. They gave assurance that
                        under the present revised barter program, each barter contract must result
                        in a net increase in exports of the agricultural commodity involved, and
                        that interest must be paid until the strategic materials are <pb n="270"
                            xml:id="pg_270" facs="0300"/>delivered or payment is otherwise effected
                        for the agricultural commodities.</p>
                    <p>The Canadians made clear that they want to sell 300 million bushels of wheat
                        abroad and indicated that they were considering a <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss>–480 type program of their own for India, Pakistan and Ceylon
                        which would be in addition to their aid through the Colombo Plan. They did
                        not, however, reveal any details or figures. The US stated that it would
                        welcome such a program and would be glad to consult with the Canadians
                        regarding it. The Canadians expressed some dissatisfaction with our previous
                        consultations with them on US wheat disposals, which they felt had not
                        affected major US disposal policies. However, they indicated their desire
                        that such consultations be continued and it was agreed to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian ministers expressed concern over the effect on Canadian
                        producers which would result from any future action by the US to raise
                        duties on imported lead and zinc. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> explained the background of the problem to the
                        Canadians in considerable detail, making clear the possibility of
                        Congressional action of a more restrictive character if the Administration
                        does not take action. He put it in terms of an attempt to redress the
                        imbalance which had developed between imports and domestic production. The
                        US emphasized that any US action would be in accordance with the General
                        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and stressed the continuing need for imports
                        of certain metals and minerals.</p>
                    <p>Regarding US investment in Canada, Minister Fleming said that he thought
                        Americans had misunderstood statements of concern in this regard by Canadian
                        leaders. He made it clear that Canada welcomed the inflow of capital and
                        recognized its important contribution to Canadian economic development. The
                        Canadian Government, he said, had no intention of promulgating any
                        restrictive or discriminatory legislation, but expressed hope that American
                        companies operating in Canada would develop and maintain closer
                        relationships with the people of Canada. Note was taken of the recent
                        supplementary tax convention between the US and Canada which was designed to
                        facilitate greater Canadian participation in American-owned corporations
                        operating in Canada.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of trade restrictions imposed by either country, and the lack
                        of consultation thereon, it was fully agreed that these matters should be
                        pursued in official channels. Among other things, the US mentioned the
                        Canadian magazine tax problem, and Minister Fleming indicated that the
                        Canadian Government would examine the problem carefully, but he made no
                        commitment that action would be taken. The Canadians stressed particularly
                        the marketing problems faced by their fruit and vegetable producers, and
                        suggested the <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0301"/>possibility of
                        restrictive action on imports of these commodities. Both governments were in
                        accord on the need for continued support of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>There was very little discussion of the British proposal made the preceding
                        week at Mont Tremblant for a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Canadian free
                        trade area. The Canadians referred to this in passing, and Fleming said that
                        the Canadians do not plan to establish any new preference scheme. He
                        explained that Prime Minister Diefenbaker’s published statement about a 15%
                        shift of imports from the US to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was
                        not a proposal. Rather, Diefenbaker had said that if such a shift could take
                        place it would solve Canada’s trade “imbalance” problem.</p>

                                    titles of the law indicated satisfaction with its basic
                                    provisions, with the following two exceptions:</p>
                                <p>Commerce would limit Title I sales to countries now unable and
                                    unlikely in the future to be able to pay dollars for additional
                                    agricultural commodities. They would in addition provide for
                                    sales for dollars on liberal credit terms to countries now
                                    lacking dollars but with prospects of having the ability to pay
                                    in the future. Commerce reserved the right to discuss this
                                    proposal before the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1">CFEP</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>Budget would prefer a reduction in Title I authorization and an
                                    increase in Title II. The Bureau’s argument is: (1) that the
                                    reduction in Title I (under last year) would maintain the
                                    Administration position that the Title is temporary and should
                                    be phased out; (2) that the increase would enable the disposal
                                    for aid purposes presently carried out under Title I. Title I
                                    would be reserved under this recommendation for currency sales
                                    motivated solely by domestic consideration of surplus
                                    disposal.</p>

                                    billion (Title I). Commerce, Treasury and Budget advocated $1
                                    billion primarily because they felt any larger amount
                                    represented a change in direction of the downward trend adopted
                                    as a policy matter last year by the <gloss target="#t_CFEP1"
                                        >CFEP</gloss>. To counter this, Agriculture adduced the
                                    argument that regardless of the Title I authorization the
                                    Congress approves—whether 1, 1.5 or 2 billion—the <hi

                                    evident in 1960.</p>
                                <p>Budget recommended $1 billion with $500,000,000 for Title I and a
                                    similar amount for Title II. State strongly and specifically
                                    opposes Budget on the following grounds: such a proposal puts
                                    foreign aid in Title II of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss>
                                    480, would lead Congress to reduce aid funds for mutual
                                    security, would thus greatly diminish the flexibility of the
                                    Mutual Security program by prescribing aid only in agricultural
                                    surpluses. Agriculture also opposes on ground that the argument
                                    would not be well received by Congress.</p>

                        exponent of “Do It Here and Now” and Commerce predicated its approval of any
                        extension on the exclusion of this provision although it would not argue the

                        a judgment about it.</p>

                            by Congressman Laurie C. Battle of Alabama and enacted on October 26,
                            1951. It provided for the suspension of U.S. economic aid to nations
                            supplying strategic materials to Communist nations. For text, see 65
                            Stat. 644.</note> be included in this Bill.</p>
                    <p>Speaking personally I am continually disturbed by our supply and demand
                        position. It is not improving noticeably despite many palliatives.
                        Throughout the world our current customers are endeavoring to become self
                        sufficient on food and fibre needs. As they succeed in increasing supply at
                        home, demand for our products will lessen and while that is proceeding we
                        provide an incentive support at home at such a level as to guarantee a
                        profit even to the inefficient producer.</p>
                    <p>Public Law 480 fails to strike at the root of our trouble and may even create
                        greater problems.</p>
                    <p>However, until something more basic is in sight, I conclude that a
                        continuance of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 is advisable. I am
                        led to believe that the Secretary of Agriculture proposes to recommend some
                        fundamental changes in the price-support and other domestic programs, but we
                        are understandably not privy to these plans and must therefore make
                        judgments on the basis of the present.</p>
                    <p>I concur in the majority opinions above expressed.</p>
                    <p>As regards the financial authorization on where there is divided opinion, I
                        prefer the higher figure. With that amount shipments might well be
                        maintained at current levels. The choice seems to lie between increased
                        authorization and increased surpluses. I prefer the former and experience
                        indicates we can maintain that rate without ill effects—State and <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> seemingly would join me in that statement.
                        I am not impressed with the sentiment expressed that an authorization larger
                        next year than this would create misunderstanding. By authorizing a smaller
                        amount, I think we would be fooling ourselves more than our neighbors.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I recommend an extension of <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 for one year (through June, 1959) with an additional
                        authorization of $1.5 <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0304"/>billion for
                        Title I, no change in Titles II and III. I further recommend that the
                        Administration assure itself that <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                        disposals are excluded from the escalator provision of price-support
                        calculations. I am not prepared to argue tactics, but the present situation
                        is wrong in principle, and unless we are assured of accomplishing the change
                        by other means, then I recommend it be included in the <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 legislation.<note n="4"

                        1954, you were kind enough to forward for our information and comment a
                        revised version of the proposal for tax legislation dealing with foreign
                        corporate income.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">Not printed. (<hi

                    <p>It is clear, I believe, that the revision is a great improvement over the
                        corresponding sections of last year’s House Bill (H.R. 8300), although I was
                        not sufficiently close to the controversy which developed on these sections
                        last year to judge whether the revised proposal will meet the problem
                        presented by the foreign wholesaling activities of United States
                        enterprises. However, the revision would appear to exclude some kinds of
                        enterprises having substantial interests abroad whose activities are
                        significant in terms of our foreign economic policy objectives.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I think there has been some misunderstanding of the
                        position of this Department. We are not opposed to extending the benefit of
                        a reduced income tax rate to an American firm operating abroad solely
                        because part of its income is derived from the sale of commodities or
                        products of United States origin. Where such an enterprise has a permanent
                        establishment abroad involving a substantial investment, its eligibility for
                        a reduced rate designed to facilitate foreign investment would seem to be
                        justifiable. Clearly, as the <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>
                        Commission stated, “the reduced rate should not apply to income from exports
                        which do not involve the risks of investment abroad”. I quite understand the
                        difficulties of <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0306"/>definition and
                        legislative drafting, but on the question of principle I felt our position
                        should be clarified.</p>
                    <p>It has been a matter of some regret that the foreign tax proposals advanced
                        by the Treasury have been limited principally to corporate income and have
                        not extended similar treatment to individual investment income. It is my
                        understanding that you now have under consideration a proposal for
                        permitting regulated investment companies to pass along to shareholders
                        their proportionate share of the credit for foreign taxes paid on the
                        dividends received by the company on its foreign securities—now permitted
                        only if the company has over 50% of its assets in foreign securities. It
                        seems to me that such a proposal warrants your sympathetic consideration, as
                        these investment companies have great potential importance as a source of
                        capital for overseas investment. It does not seem equitable for individual
                        investors to be denied the foreign tax credit on investments made through
                        such companies, and I am hopeful that practical proposals can be developed
                        for meeting this situation.</p>
                    <p>We continue to be greatly interested in the development of tax policy with
                        respect to foreign income since it is one of the positive and constructive
                        aspects of the Administration’s foreign economic policy recommendations. I
                        hope you will keep me informed of developments from time to time, and will
                        call upon me or my staff whenever we can be of any assistance.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>The terms approved by the Council for loans under the Mutual Security Act
                            (<gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665) and the Agriculture Trade and
                        Development Assistance Act (<gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480) provide
                        for a minimum interest rate of 3 percent if interest and amortization
                        payments are in dollars and 4 percent if in local currency. Loan agreements
                        providing for local currency repayment permit the borrowing government to
                        transfer irrevocably at any time to a dollar basis of repayment at the lower
                        rate of interest thereafter. Largely as a result of developments during the
                        negotiations on a <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loan to Japan,
                        certain questions have been raised in the Staff Committee regarding these
                        loan terms which should be submitted to the Council.</p>
                    <p>The questions are as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Should the borrower’s option as to currency of repayment be
                                modified to give the borrower the right to choose the currency in

                                appropriate interest rate on each such payment? The present
                                arrangement permits the borrower to select the currency of repayment
                                at the beginning of the loan contract, but permits him to change
                                only from local currency to dollars, and as a condition of receiving
                                the lower interest rate, requires him to agree to make all future
                                payments in dollars.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>If the loan terms are modified with respect to the repayment
                                option, should such modified terms apply only to loans under <gloss
                                    target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 or to loans under <gloss
                                    target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 as well? There are several
                                differences between the two programs. Perhaps the principal one is
                                that <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans are made in local
                                currency derived from the sale of surplus commodities, while <gloss
                                    target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 loans are made in dollars as
                                part of aid programs. This might argue for more lenient terms for
                                the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans. On the other
                                hand, borrowing governments often expect equality of terms as
                                between the two types of loans and might resist more stringent terms
                                in the case of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 loans.
                                Moreover, there <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0308"/>are
                                considerable administrative advantages in standardizing the terms on
                                both types of loans.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>A related issue, which is not directly raised by the Japanese
                                negotiation but which deserves mention, is the possibility of
                                reducing the minimum interest rates on these loans. Reduction of the
                                minimum levels below 3 and 4 percent, while retaining the spread as
                                between repayment in dollars or in local currency, has been
                                suggested. It has also been suggested that it would be preferable to
                                abandon the differential between the rates and to charge 3 percent
                                on all loans regardless of the currency in which repayment is
                                made.</item>

                    <p>The Chairman introduced <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No.
                        1784, concerning the terms of loans under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 and <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GCD1">Glendinning</persName> described the current
                        negotiations with the Japanese for a loan under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480, pointing out that the issues presented in the paper
                        were involved in the negotiations but had application to other situations as
                        well. The immediate issue was whether the option of the borrower as to
                        currency of repayment under a <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loan
                        should be modified. Present loan agreements permit the borrower to select
                        the currency of repayment at the beginning of the contract, but permit him
                        to change only from local currency to dollars, and require him to make all
                        future payments in dollars as a condition of receiving the lower interest
                        rate applicable to dollar repayments. It was now proposed to modify the
                        option arrangement to permit the borrower to exercise a choice as to
                        currency of repayment and as to interest rate, with respect to each separate
                        payment. The Japanese had insisted that the loan agreement provide for
                        repayment in dollars for reasons peculiar to their case, and desired this
                        modification of the option to make their repayment obligation flexible. A
                        related issue was whether such modified option terms should be applied to
                        loans under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 as well as under <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480. A separate and general issue was
                        possible easing of the interest terms in these loans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">Gwynn Garnett,
                            Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service, Department of
                            Agriculture.</note> expressed the concern of the Department of
                        Agriculture about the problem of disposing of agricultural surpluses under
                        the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program. Agriculture favored the
                        modification of the repayment option because it was felt that this was
                        necessary to enable the Japanese negotiation to be concluded successfully
                        and would materially assist the negotiation of other sales of surplus
                        commodities. Agriculture also favored a reduction of the rate of interest on
                        loans from the proceeds of such sales to 3 percent, regardless of the
                        currency of repayment. Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> said that
                        Agriculture had no position on whether the terms of <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 665 loans should be altered to contain the same repayment
                        option as those under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName> indicated that if
                        changes are made in the terms of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                        loans, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> would want the same terms for
                        loans under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 because of the advantage
                        of uniformity in avoiding confusion and difficulty in administration of the
                        loan programs. <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> thought it undesirable to
                        make further concessions as to the interest rate, and preferred to retain
                        the 1 percent differential. <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> felt also
                        that present option arrangements had not presented difficulties in <pb
                            n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0310"/>the loan agreements negotiated thus
                        far, and feared that if the change were made for Japan the new terms would
                        have to be extended to borrowers under existing agreements in cases in which
                        the borrowers had originally been offered an option as to the currency of
                        repayment. <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> would therefore prefer to see
                        the option provision unchanged.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJC1">Corbett</persName> informed the Council that
                        the Department of State favored the proposed change in the option
                        arrangements, and felt that it would be advisable to extend such changed
                        terms to <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 loans, including existing
                        loans to countries which originally had had an option. State would prefer
                        lower interest rates than the present 3 and 4 percent, but also favored a
                        spread of about 1 percent in order to retain the incentive to repay in
                        dollars rather than in local currency. The Chairman commented that in terms
                        of the cost of money to the Government 3 percent for dollar repayment
                        represented an irreducible minimum, especially in view of the initial grace
                        period on interest accruals.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EMGGE1">Edgerton</persName> indicated that
                        while the Export-Import Bank did not have a strong direct interest in the
                        matter, he would prefer to see the option arrangements unchanged and would
                        like to see the spread in the interest rate maintained. Governor Szymczak
                        expressed agreement with the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> position.
                        Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> expressed agreement with the <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> position on the option and on the interest
                        rate, but did not agree that uniformity of terms between the two types of
                        loan was necessarily desirable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1"
                            >Brundage</persName> indicated that the Bureau of the Budget felt
                        satisfied with the present arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> pointed out to the Council that the proposed
                        sale to Japan was estimated at $85 million, and stated that he feared a
                        Council decision against the proposed two-way option would further delay the
                        negotiations. The Department of Agriculture considered this a very important
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> commented that the purpose
                        of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program is to dispose of
                        agricultural surpluses and that difficulty in doing so would constitute a
                        reason for a change in the existing Council position. He inquired why it
                        would be necessary to extend changed option terms to <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 665 loans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1"
                            >FitzGerald</persName> replied that administrative simplicity was one
                        argument, and pointed out that many <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665
                        loans are made from local currency derived from the sale of agricultural
                        surpluses. <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> feared that if the loan terms
                        under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 were materially softer than
                        those under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665, <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> might experience difficulty in administering its
                        agricultural surplus disposal program.</p>
                    <p>The relationship of the two programs was discussed further and the probable
                        effect of the two-way option on the amount of dollar repayments under loan
                        agreements was discussed. It was pointed out <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281"
                            facs="0311"/>in this connection that under the existing option countries
                        electing to repay in dollars are required to commit themselves to dollar
                        repayment for the duration of the loan agreement in order to obtain the
                        benefit of the lower interest rate, and that this might deter countries from
                        electing to pay in dollars because of an understandable reluctance to commit
                        themselves for long periods in the future. It was argued that the two-way
                        option would enable a borrowing country to repay dollars at the lower rate
                        of interest during any period in which its balance-of-payments position was
                        favorable, while leaving open an avenue of retreat to local currency
                        repayment should the balance-of-payments position become less favorable.
                        Therefore, it was argued that it was likely that the U.S. would collect more
                        dollars under the two-way option than under the existing arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hooker</persName> reported that the management of the
                        International Bank had expressed concern about the terms of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loan to Japan. The <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would like to see the loan made because
                        the Bank hopes to make an agricultural loan to Japan, but is unwilling to
                        proceed until the current loan negotiations are settled. The Bank felt that
                        unless the two-way option proposal is extended to Japan, the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> might have difficulty in extending its
                        contemplated credit, since the Bank would view less favorably a Japanese
                        commitment to repay a <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loan in
                        dollars than a commitment to repay under the two-way option proposal.</p>
                    <p>In the course of subsequent discussion there was general agreement on the
                        desirability of maintaining a differential in the interest rate terms and
                        for retaining the present rate structure of 3 and 4 percent. While there was
                        no complete agreement with respect to the two-way option proposal and
                        uniformity of terms as between <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 665 loans, there was general
                        agreement that it would be desirable to find some compromise solution which
                        would be acceptable to the International Bank and would not interfere with
                        its possible extension of credits, while at the same time permitting
                        successful conclusion of the Japanese negotiations. The Chairman summarized
                        the discussion and suggested that the Staff Committee meet in the near
                        future to work on a possible solution, and in the interim suggested further
                        consultation with the International Bank. The Council agreed with this
                        suggestion. (The Staff Committee met on the following day, May 10, 1955, and
                        reached agreement on a recommendation to the Council which was approved by a

                                are hereby amended so that loan agreements under Public Law 665 and
                                Public Law 480 may give the borrowing government the right, with
                                respect to each payment of interest and amortization, to elect

                        commented that the management of the International Bank had indicated
                        dissatisfaction with the compromise suggestions, because each of them in
                        effect left the expectation of a loan repayable in dollars. In the light of
                        the understanding reached at the Council meeting on the maintenance of the
                        level of interest rates and the interest rate differential, the Treasury was
                        now willing to propose favorable action on the option proposal, by a
                        telephone poll of the Council. Mr. <persName>Bennett</persName> stated that
                            <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> was still opposed to the option
                        proposal for the reasons previously given, and wished to have its opposition
                        recorded in the minutes of the Staff Committee. After discussion the
                        Committee <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0314"/>agreed to recommend
                        favorably to the Council a draft action of general applicability which would
                        authorize the use of the 2-way option clause in loan agreements under both

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: Last year, your Committee and
                        the House of Representatives included as part of the tax revision bill new
                        provisions giving a lower rate of tax on corporate business income earned
                        abroad, somewhat similar to that available since 1942 to income earned in
                        the Western Hemisphere. Provision also was made for postponement of taxes on
                        the income of foreign branches until it was removed from the country where
                        it was earned, a treatment somewhat comparable to that now given to the
                        income of foreign subsidiaries. These sections were omitted from the bill as
                        reported by the Senate Finance Committee, but the report of that Committee
                        stated the hope that provisions along these lines might be developed in the
                        Conference between the House and the Senate before final passage of the tax
                        bill. This was not done. The Treasury Department has continued to examine
                        the problem since that time.</p>
                    <p>I now submit to you a suggested draft of legislation<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d112fn2"><persName corresp="#p_CJ1">Cooper</persName> introduced
                            the legislation, which became H.R. 7725, in the House of Representatives
                            on July 29, 1955. A copy of the bill is in Department of State, Central
                            File 811.112/8–3055.</note> designed to secure the results which were
                        sought and apparently desired last year. This is in accord with the
                        President’s recommendation in 1954, which was reaffirmed in his message on
                        Foreign Economic Policy on January 10 of this year.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d112fn3">For text of the message, see Public Papers of the

                    <p>The purpose of this recommended legislation is to facilitate the investment
                        abroad of capital from this country. At present, our business firms are at a
                        disadvantage in countries with lower taxes than our own when they have to
                        compete with local capital, or capital from countries which impose lower
                        taxes on foreign income than we do. Foreign countries are also under an
                        incentive to increase taxes on United States enterprises up to the level of
                        United States tax rates.</p>
                    <p>Capital investment will aid in the economic development of foreign countries.
                        Participation by United States enterprises will encourage development along
                        the lines we have followed in this country which are especially helpful in
                        raising living standards, through high wages and mass markets, and which
                        will promote the flow of international trade with the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Treasury staffs and I will be glad to be of such assistance as we can to
                        you, your Committee, and your staffs in any consideration which you may wish
                        to give to the taxation of foreign business income. A memorandum explaining
                        our analysis of three of the problems we have considered in this area is

                        for the Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> recalled
                        that it had been agreed in the Council a year previously that it would be
                        desirable to obtain exchange guaranties on sales and on loans repayable in
                        local currency under the Agricultural Trade Act (<gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480, as amended). Since that time considerable difficulty
                        had been experienced in negotiating sales and loan agreements under this Act
                        with exchange guaranties. The current problem was the negotiation with
                        Brazil, which objects to giving an exchange guaranty for a loan repayable in
                        cruzeiros. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> indicated that
                        the negotiations might break down on this issue. In view of the difficulties
                        which had been experienced over the past year, Agriculture was proposing as
                        a general policy matter the elimination of exchange guaranties on sales of
                        agricultural commodities under Title <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0317"
                        />I of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and on loans of sales
                        proceeds repayable in local currency. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1"
                            >Butz</persName> felt that the practical issue for the United States was
                        of limited significance, since the existing exchange guaranties would be
                        difficult to put into effect, and would have to be renegotiated if
                        exercised.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> expressed agreement with
                        the proposal advanced by Agriculture. The State Department felt that since
                        the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans are already quite soft,
                        this additional relaxation would not be of material significance to the
                        United States, while it would probably facilitate the carrying out of the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman inquired as to the effect of this proposal on Mutual Security
                        Program loans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HEB1">Hall</persName> recalled that
                        the existing terms for Mutual Security loans and for <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 loans were uniform. <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> opposed the Agriculture proposal to abandon exchange

                            >ICA</gloss> would favor the same terms for Mutual Security loans. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HEB1">Hall</persName> pointed out that the same
                        commodities are often involved in both Mutual Security loans and <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans, and that under these conditions
                        softer terms of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans might create
                        difficulties for <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> in placing sufficient
                        aid on loan terms to satisfy the desires of the Congress in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>There was a brief discussion of the effect of the proposed softening on the
                        existing interest rate differential as between repayment in dollars and
                        repayments in local currency.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> inquired how the
                        proposed change might affect other financial operations, and how it would
                        affect existing loan obligations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1"
                            >Butz</persName> indicated that there was no legal obligation upon
                        Agriculture to reopen existing loan agreements, but he felt sure that the
                        question would be raised. He commented that very few loan agreements had
                        been signed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJC1">Corbett</persName> suggested
                        that the fiscal year 1956 be the period in which the new policy would become
                        applicable, noting that no agreements had yet been signed in fiscal 1956 and
                        that only one, the Japanese agreement, had been initialled. The retroactive
                        application of the two-way option decision (<gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss> Action No. 783)<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">See <ref

                        recalled, and it was agreed that pressure from existing borrowers for
                        retroactive application of the change now proposed would probably arise, but
                        that the Council need not decide this question at the present time.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman stated that the proposed policy change, if adopted, should be
                        discretionary and not mandatory. Mr. <persName>Ioanes</persName><note n="4"
                            xml:id="d113fn4"><persName corresp="#p_SR1">Raymond</persName> Ioanes,
                            Executive Assistant to the Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural
                            Service, Department of Agriculture.</note> indicated that Agriculture
                        would not change its policy of lending in dollars <pb n="288"
                            xml:id="pg_288" facs="0318"/>when circumstances so indicate, as in the
                        Argentine case, but he felt that cases in which dollar repayment could be
                        required would be fairly rare. The Argentine loan was a special case in that
                        Argentina is normally a competitor of the United States, unlike most
                        borrowing countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCHC1">McClellan</persName> stated that the
                        Department of Commerce would be guided by the opinions of interested
                        agencies, particularly the opinions of the Treasury on the fiscal aspects of
                        the proposal. Commerce would agree reluctantly with the proposal, with the
                        thought that the practical problem was one of obtaining as favorable terms
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman expressed doubt that the fiscal burden on the United States
                        would be measurably increased by the adoption of the proposed policy. He saw
                        little prospect for dollar repayments, or for local currency repayments that
                        would in fact be substitutes for dollar appropriations.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman expressed concern over the implication that abandonment of the
                        exchange guaranty would practically eliminate the prospect of dollar loans.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJC1">Corbett</persName> commented that under the
                        existing situation the exchange risk fell on the borrower or on his
                        government, and that private individuals were reluctant to borrow to meet
                        local expenditures when they had to give an exchange guaranty. For this
                        reason the State Department would expect the abandonment of exchange
                        guaranties to result in increased loans of <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 proceeds to private investors in foreign countries. He
                        noted that in Brazil private power companies would like to borrow these
                        funds but would not do so if exchange guaranties were required.</p>
                    <p>Governor Szymczak felt that the Council had no choice but to approve the
                        proposal, since the problem was to obtain the best terms possible. The
                        Chairman indicated that the Treasury Department reluctantly agreed with the
                        proposal with respect to 1956 business on a permissive rather than a
                        mandatory basis, and that the 1955 cases could be considered as they
                        arose.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman expressed the decision of the Council as giving discretion to
                        the administering agencies to require repayment in dollars, or to allow
                        repayment in local currencies either with an exchange guaranty or when
                        necessary without an exchange guaranty. It was agreed that this decision
                        would apply to fiscal year 1956 business, including the Japanese loan, and
                        that its application to 1955 business would depend on further consideration
                        of individual cases. The Chairman suggested that the action apply only to
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans and that the Council
                        consider the question of applying the same policy to Mutual Security loans
                        at a later date, after a review of the legislative history and taking into
                        account the distinct nature of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        program. This was agreed.</p>
                    <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0319"/>
                    <p>It was pointed out that most 1955 loan agreements had not yet been signed. It
                        was noted that the loan agreements are separate from the sales agreements
                        and had been subject to considerable delays in negotiation. The 1955 program
                        covered about $150 million of loans, most of which was represented by
                        agreements not yet signed. The Japanese loan amounted to about one-half of
                        this amount.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> stated that the
                        Council’s decision did not affect exchange rate policy in the Fund, but that
                        the exchange rate applicable to initial sales agreements would affect
                        general exchange rate policy. He commented that this decision might enable
                        Agriculture to obtain a more realistic exchange rate for the initial sales
                        transactions.</p>
                    <p>The following action was taken (Action No. 826): <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The National Advisory Council offers no objection to sales of
                                agricultural surpluses under Public Law 480 and loans of local
                                currency proceeds of such sales without exchange guaranties, when in
                                the judgment of the administering agencies the objectives of the
                                program would be jeopardized by an attempt to obtain an exchange
                                guaranty. It is understood that this discretionary policy would
                                apply to sales and loan agreements beginning with the fiscal year
                                1956.”</p>

                            currency paid to the U.S. under the loan agreements. In the case of
                            Mutual Security Program loans, the Congress must approve the use to be
                            made of the funds received. The effective dollar return to the U.S. on

                            480)</hi></p>
                    <p>The Council met to reconsider the exchange guaranty aspects of the terms of
                        loans under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act (Public
                        Law 480). At the request of the Chairman, the Acting Secretary read the text
                        of the Council’s previous Action on this subject (<gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss> Action No. 826<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note>). The Chairman then
                        reviewed briefly the factual background of the decision taken in Action No.
                        826, to allow the administering agencies discretionary authority to
                        negotiate loan agreements without exchange guaranties when, in their
                        opinion, the objectives of the program would be jeopardized by insistence on
                        an exchange guaranty. The Chairman then asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> if he cared to comment.</p>
                    <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0323"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> recalled that he had
                        been out of the country at the time of the earlier Council consideration of
                        this matter (see Council Minutes No. 235<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3"><hi
                                rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></note>), and that upon reflection on the
                        implications of Action No. 826, beyond the Brazilian case, he had requested
                        further Council discussion of the matter. He felt that to the greatest
                        possible extent the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program should
                        be conducted so as to minimize the dollar cost to the United States, an
                        objective not likely to be served by negotiating loans without exchange
                        guaranties. He feared that the waiver of the exchange guaranty in the
                        Brazilian case pursuant to Action No. 826 was likely to touch off a chain
                        reaction affecting both future <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans
                        and the foreign aid program. He noted that it was now proposed to waive the
                        guaranty in the case of the Japanese loan, and felt that the pressure would
                        grow to make all <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans without
                        exchange guaranties. Such a development would make it very difficult for
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> to lend foreign currencies derived
                        from sales of commodities under Section 402 of the Mutual Security Act, as
                        long as exchange guaranties were required on such loans. Even without the
                        waiver of the guaranty, the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program
                        had already become somewhat competitive with the Section 402 program. He
                        felt that in view of the difficulty of treating different foreign countries
                        in different ways, it would be in fact very difficult to apply the waiver of
                        the guaranty only to exceptional cases.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> said that he felt that
                        the Council had taken <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action No. 826 on
                        a general policy basis rather than with respect to the Brazilian case alone.
                        Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> agreed, and said it was difficult to handle
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans on an individual basis,
                        and that Agriculture would prefer as a general matter not to ask for
                        exchange guaranties unless special reasons existed for requiring harder
                        terms. The Chairman pointed out that such an approach would not be
                        consistent with <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action No. 826, which
                        provided for waiver of the guaranty only when it was considered that a
                        guaranty would jeopardize the objectives of the program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> felt that in the Japanese case no exchange
                        guaranty should be required because insistence on it would, in his opinion,
                        jeopardize the sale of the surplus commodities. He felt that the requirement
                        that the United States consider the economic position of the borrowing
                        countries with respect to the use of the foreign currency proceeds of the
                        loans was a more significant source of “softness” than the lack of an
                        exchange guaranty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName>
                        recalled that at Council Meeting No. 235, Agriculture and State had
                        expressed the view that the lack of an exchange guaranty would have little
                        effect on the “softness” of the loans.</p>
                    <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0324"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> indicated that Commerce was dubious about
                        waiving the exchange guaranty and felt that there could reasonably be a
                        difference between the aid program and the program for disposing of surplus
                        commodities. He felt that there should be an element of incentive to
                        encourage the disposal of surpluses under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480, over and above the grants and loans in the aid
                        program. Gov. Szymczak, on the other hand, felt that both programs should be
                        put on the same basis despite the differences between them because they both
                        appeared the same from the point of view of the borrowing country.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName>, Mr. <persName>Zaglits</persName><note n="4"
                            xml:id="d115fn4">Oscar Zaglits, Foreign Agricultural Service, Department
                            of Agriculture.</note> explained that <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 essentially provides for sales of surplus commodities
                        against foreign currencies and does not require exchange guaranties. In
                        negotiations regarding the use of the local currency proceeds, Agriculture
                        had tried to obtain exchange guaranties, and had encountered difficult
                        negotiating problems. In the Brazilian case negotiations had gone on for
                        about a year and it had become clear that no agreement was possible if an
                        exchange guaranty was required. Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName>, commenting
                        on the Japanese case, indicated that Japan was sensitive to interest rate
                        considerations and might not accept the waiver of the exchange guaranty even
                        if offered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLU1">Stambaugh</persName> felt that the exchange
                        guaranty might not be of too much importance because only a portion of the
                        foreign currency proceeds could be used for U.S. Government purposes, and
                        the balance would presumably be loaned out for the economic development of
                        the borrowing countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> voiced objection to allowing the borrower to set
                        the exchange rate at which repayments would be made. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d115fn5"><persName
                                corresp="#p_RRWE1">Ralph W. E. Reid</persName>, Assistant to the
                            Director of the Bureau of the Budget.</note> said that he felt that in
                        its previous discussion the Council had considered the Brazilian case the
                        exception rather than the rule, and recalled that the Council had at that
                        time decided that the waiver of the guaranty would not apply to loans under
                        the Mutual Security Program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1"
                            >Southard</persName> felt that it might be feasible to have different
                        standards for loans under the two programs, in view of their differing
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the question of the probable value to the U.S.
                        Government of foreign currency repayments, in terms of whether the U.S.
                        Government had need for the foreign currencies and in terms of the
                        requirement that the U.S. take into consideration the economic condition of
                        the borrowing countries. The Chairman expressed the opinion that in many
                        cases the U.S. might obtain effective dollar utilization only to the extent
                        of 10 or 15 percent of the foreign currency proceeds. He recalled that
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action No. 826 <pb n="295"
                            xml:id="pg_295" facs="0325"/>was taken to enable Agriculture to conclude
                        the Brazilian loan, and felt that the record was clear as to the exceptional
                        character of the Brazilian case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> commented that the differing interpretations of
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action No. 826 were the reason he
                        wished to see the question reopened. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1"
                            >Kalijarvi</persName> stated that the key to the problem is the
                        concessions necessary to enable the surpluses to be sold. He noted that
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 contains authority for grants as
                        well as loans and does not provide guidance as to the distinction between
                        grants and loans. He felt that a case could be made for a distinction
                        between <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 and Mutual Security
                        operations, in view of their differing purposes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> noted that after the
                        Brazilian case every prospective borrower would know that a waiver of an
                        exchange guaranty was a possible condition of a loan, and would be likely to
                        attempt to obtain the softest possible repayment option. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName>, recalling that the Japanese loan
                        had been mentioned at the earlier Council discussion, said that since the
                        terms of the Brazilian loan had become publicly known, denial of a Japanese
                        request for a waiver of the exchange guaranty would create a very difficult
                        situation. Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> indicated that the Japanese
                        negotiations were being held up on the question of the exchange guaranty. He
                        stated that the Japanese had requested information on the terms of the
                        Brazilian loan as a possible alternative to the already initialled
                        agreement, which had been negotiated before <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss> Action No. 826 was taken. The Council discussed briefly the
                        question of the relative United States interests in Japan and Brazil.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> suggested that each
                        waiver of exchange guaranty be treated as an exception to the general
                        policy, and that each such case be referred to the Council. He stated that
                        if the guaranty waiver were widely applied, he would be forced to report to
                        the Congress that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was unable to meet its
                        obligation to dispose of surpluses under Section 402. In this regard Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> stated that in
                        presenting its program to the Congress his agency had informally assured the
                        Committees that exchange guaranties would be obtained.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> argued that <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> loans are already soft, and that a waiver of exchange
                        guaranty on <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans would not
                        materially affect <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s loan program. He
                        felt that Agriculture needed all possible assistance in disposing of
                        surpluses under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480, and that the waiver
                        of exchange guaranties was not of primary importance, although it helped. He
                        hoped that further complication of loan clearance procedures in the
                        Government could be avoided. He felt that in practice every prospective
                        borrowing country would elect the non-guaranteed local currency loan at 5
                        percent interest.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed at length the Japanese case and the relationship of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 programs to each other. Mr.
                            <persName>Garnett</persName>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0326"/>noted that the Japanese sale
                        involved $65 million worth of surplus commodities, and argued that <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> has an advantage over Agriculture in moving
                        surpluses under Section 402 because it is not bound by the requirement that
                        sales be “in excess of the usual marketings” of the commodities. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> pointed out the
                        considerable pressures toward disposing of agricultural surpluses, and felt
                        that if the Japanese sale should fail, serious questions would be raised.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> commented that the problem
                        is to dispose of surplus commodities and expressed the view that if the
                        Council were again confronted with the problem it faced in the Brazilian
                        case it would again come reluctantly to the conclusion expressed in <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action No. 826. He assumed that because of
                        the pressures to move surpluses the administering agencies would see
                        “jeopardy” in many individual cases. He felt that this situation constituted
                        a good argument for providing assistance in the form of either hard loans or
                        grants rather than soft loans. The Chairman commented that foreign currency
                        loans with or without exchange guaranties have many elements of grant
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>It was proposed by Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> that the Council revise
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action No. 826, so that as a matter
                        of general policy there would be no waiver of exchange guaranties in <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loans, including the Japanese loan and
                        any future Brazilian loans, with the proviso that individual cases in which
                        the administering agencies believed that the exchange guaranty should be
                        waived would be referred to the Council. This proposal was supported by
                        Governor Szymczak and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Burgess</persName>,
                        and opposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SLU1">Stambaugh</persName> felt that in view of
                        the publicity given to the Brazilian loan terms it would be preferable to
                        permit a waiver in the case of Japan and then apply the revised policy in
                        future cases.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> noted that very few prospective negotiations
                        involved such large amounts of surplus commodities as were at issue in the
                        Japanese case, and reviewed briefly the pattern of exports of U.S.
                        agricultural products to Japan. He felt that in view of the importance of
                        the Japanese case, the Department of Agriculture would request that it be
                        reopened. The Chairman replied that the Council would be glad to reconsider
                        the matter if further discussion were desired.</p>
                    <p>The following action was taken (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Action
                        No. 840): <quote rend="blockquote">

                        were advanced for the use of foreign currencies for the promotion of private

                        comment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> stated that the
                        International Cooperation Administration had been concerned by the
                        accumulation of local currencies arising from <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >P.L.</gloss> 480 operations and with the problem of proper utilization
                        of these currencies. <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had received
                        numerous inquiries from private firms having need of local currencies as to
                        the possible availability of foreign currencies from the Government. These
                        firms <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0328"/>were reluctant to use dollars
                        for purchase of foreign currencies if they could be obtained from U.S.
                        holdings.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> suggested several possible
                        ways of dealing with the problem, including the formation of financial
                        institutions in foreign countries similar to the Investment Credit and
                        Investment Corporation of India (<gloss target="#t_ICICI1">ICICI</gloss>),
                        and the allocation of a portion of the foreign currency proceeds of surplus
                        sales for loans to private persons, American and foreign, on a
                        non-discriminatory basis. He felt that such arrangements would not conflict
                        with Export-Import Bank or International Bank operations, since neither bank
                        provided local currencies, and he recalled that development banks in Turkey,
                        India and Ethiopia had been established with the aid of counterpart funds.
                        He felt that if the establishment of investment institutions in less
                        developed countries proved to be impractical, the problem might be dealt
                        with through the allocation of currencies for loans to private
                        borrowers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> remarked that use of these
                        local currencies for the financing of the local cost of investment projects
                        had been proposed by many persons, including a number of United States
                        businessmen. He felt that the availability of these currencies for use in
                        connection with Export-Import Bank credits would be helpful. He felt that
                        the establishment of investment institutions in less developed countries
                        might well not be feasible in a good many cases.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the problem at length. The existing procedures for the
                        use of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 currencies were described. It
                        was pointed out that under most existing agreements loans of the foreign
                        currencies were made by local financial institutions, and that the United
                        States had the power of approving specific projects for which the loans
                        could be used. It was suggested that the foreign currencies could be made
                        available under existing arrangements for use in connection with
                        Export-Import Bank operations, through appropriate liaison between the Bank
                        and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The various possibilities for the administration of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> proposal were considered. There was general
                        agreement that the objective of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        proposal was desirable. The Chairman stated that caution was necessary in
                        any use of U.S. Government funds to establish or strengthen foreign
                        government institutions, as distinguished from private enterprises.
                        Difficult problems were foreseen if the program should have the effect of
                        entry by U.S. Government agencies into banking systems of foreign countries.
                        It was pointed out that in many cases, foreign countries desired U.S.
                        private investors to purchase required local currency for dollars, and that
                        problems might arise if the local currency were obtained, instead, from the
                        U.S. Government.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> outlined a suggested order
                        of priority for the use of the local currency: (1) the establishment of
                        local investment institutions along the lines suggested in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> investment study (see <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No. 1868 (Revised)); (2) use of
                        the foreign currency in conjunction with long-term investment projects,
                        particularly in connection with Export-Import Bank loans to private
                        enterprises; (3) use of the foreign currencies for certain types of public
                        projects, such as road construction. He also raised the question of whether
                        the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agreements should provide for
                        non-discriminatory loans, as suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1"
                            >Schaefer</persName>, or whether the desired result could be achieved
                        through representations to the foreign governments by the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the Chairman suggested that in view of
                        the importance and complexity of the problem, it would be desirable to have
                        further staff work done on it, to outline what was being done in this field
                        and to suggest the principles that should govern U.S. policies. The Council
                        agreed to this procedure.</p>

                        acquired under that Act. The field urgently needs guidance to proceed with

                    <p><gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> proposes to program and control those
                        local currency uses for which it has responsibility under Public Law 480
                        through a modified version of the regular <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> procedure. This would include, after sales and loan
                        agreements have been negotiated, submission by the country concerned of
                        special projects for <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> analysis and
                        approval, release of funds to the country in accordance with actual
                        expenditure requirements, and provision for audit and financial and progress
                        reports. We feel these control steps are essential to assure conformity with
                        U.S. policy, adequate coordination with regular <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> programs, and proper accountability.</p>
                    <p>There has been some feeling at the staff level in the Department that the
                        proposed procedures are apt to create frictions with other governments in
                        that they involve more extensive controls than are appropriate considering
                        the nature of surplus sales under Public Law 480. As a counter proposal it
                        has been suggested that control be confined to a general understanding at
                        the time of the sales agreements on the types and kinds of projects to be
                        financed, and provision for subsequent reports and audit. This would omit
                        the stage of specific project advance review and approval which is the heart
                        of our regular procedure.</p>
                    <p>I believe that to so weaken our controls and accountability would not only be
                        unwise, but is unnecessary to meet the point on creation of friction. The
                        difficulties cited come not from the nature of our procedures, which are
                        generally well understood and accepted under our regular program, but from
                        failure to have these procedures clearly understood at the outset of the
                        Public Law 480 sales transaction. The draft message to the field will assure
                        this.</p>

                        disagreement was whether there was some area where maintenance of the value
                        of the local currency might not be required.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that no one was
                        more anxious than he to see local currency used to get private enterprise to
                        do a job that otherwise the American taxpayers’ money would have to do.
                        Although there possibly were circumstances where it might be necessary <pb
                            n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0332"/>to make concessions, he did not
                        wish to start breaking down the maintenance of value provision in the
                        original negotiations. At the present time the sales agreement is negotiated
                        before the loan agreement. It was his view that the loan agreement should be
                        signed at the same time as the sales agreement. If later it should turn out
                        that in a particular country an exception with respect to maintenance of
                        value was necessary in order to get some money into the private industry
                        sector, some modification in the loan agreement might be made. However, he

                            Foreign Operations Administration.</note> had assured Congress that the
                        dollar value of the local currency loans would be maintained. He made the
                        additional points that any change in the maintenance of value concept would
                        probably have repercussions on the Section 402 loans and the Mutual Security
                        loans; that the United States was making a concession in not charging
                        interest for the first 3 years of the loans; that the foreign countries were
                        being offered a very low rate of interest and would have the opportunity of
                        making a substantial profit on re-lending; that the maintenance of value
                        provision might act as a deterrent to devaluation; that it was <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s responsibility to see that funds were
                        properly accounted for once they were loaned; and that there was great
                        difficulty in many countries in differentiating between the private sector
                        and the public sector. He thought that abandonment of the maintenance of
                        value provision would make the program more difficult to carry out.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman inquired whether in any of the contracts to date there had been
                        an exception to provision for repayment in dollars. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> replied that Brazil was the only
                        exception.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> said that the position of the Department of
                        Agriculture was that there were certain advantages in not having a
                        maintenance of value clause in these loans. The Chairman inquired whether in
                        negotiating the loans it would be possible to segregate the funds to be
                        loaned to private industry and to waive the maintenance of value clause only
                        with respect to such funds. Mr. <persName>Garnett thought</persName> this
                        might be done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> said that he understood two steps were
                        involved, the first being a government-to-government transaction between the
                        United States and the foreign country, and the second the contract that the
                        local government makes with private enterprise. As he understood the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> position there would be insistence on
                        maintenance of value in the first step, and the State Department was in
                        agreement with that position. He inquired whether in the second step <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> would require the local government to
                        include a maintenance <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0333"/>of value
                        clause in its contract with the private enterprise. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that that would be up to the
                        local government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> inquired whether, if the foreign government
                        did not require a maintenance of value clause in its contracts with local
                        enterprise, it might argue when it came time to repay, say 10 years hence,
                        that part of the exchange loss that had been incurred was due to a loan made
                        to an American company. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>
                        said <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was not making a distinction
                        between American and foreign companies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> also asked whether, if a country required a
                        maintenance of value clause from private companies, and an American company
                        wanted a loan but did not wish to assume the maintenance of value obligation
                        and appealed to the U.S. Government, we would do anything about it. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> did not see why we
                        should.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> further inquired whether there should be
                        any requirement that the foreign government set aside any portion of the
                        funds for American enterprises. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                            >Hollister</persName> said this was worth considering but he was not
                        willing to insist upon such a requirement now. The State Department might
                        wish to look at it carefully on a country-by-country basis.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked how many loans had actually been made. Mr.
                            <persName>Shenefield</persName> said that there had been 11 loans to 9
                        countries. Both the Spanish and the Japanese Governments had loaned funds to
                        private borrowers without passing on the maintenance of value clause to the
                        borrowers. In Brazil, with no maintenance of value clause, one loan had been
                        made to subsidiaries of the American and Foreign Power Co.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> pointed out that principal
                        payments on loans under Section 402 were now coming due and that the
                        Export-Import Bank was going to be confronted with an acute problem in the
                        next 18 months. Interest had been paid regularly on these loans but there
                        were some delinquencies on principal payments starting July 1. Under the
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program loans would be made to
                        governments for 30 to 40 years at a 3 percent rate. He did not see how there
                        could be one set of conditions for one set of loans and another set for a
                        second series of loans. He pointed out that there were no Section 402 loans
                        to Brazil. Furthermore, he did not see how anything could be done about the
                        maintenance of value provision without going to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> said that the interest of the Commerce
                        Department stemmed from a policy of promoting private capital investment. He
                        thought the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> proposal would provide an
                        incentive to private investment, provided maintenance of value was not
                        imposed on the private borrower. The Chairman asked whether Mr.
                            <persName>Smith</persName> would require the borrowing government to
                        maintain value and would <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0334"/>hope the
                        government would not pass that responsibility on to the private borrower.
                        Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> agreed and said he thought this should be
                        stipulated in the negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1"
                            >Schaefer</persName>, however, believed it would be inappropriate to
                        stipulate what the foreign government should do in its relations with
                        private borrowers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Marget</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d118fn5"><persName>Arthur
                                W. Marget</persName>, Director of the Division of International
                            Finance, Federal Reserve System.</note> said that he understood the
                        proposition was that there would be maintenance of value in
                        government-to-government transactions and that what happened thereafter was
                        not our business. He thought that was extremely important. Removal of the
                        maintenance of value provision might create more damage than otherwise. The
                        Chairman said he understood the consensus to be that the paragraph in
                        brackets on the second page of the draft action should be omitted. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> said the staff would
                        interpret this decision to mean that if in the course of negotiations it
                        proved impossible to get both a set-aside of funds for private enterprise
                        and maintenance of value, the set-aside would be abandoned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Smith</persName> believed this raised the question of how
                        seriously our negotiators were going to try to get agreement on a set-aside.
                        The amount might vary but a real effort should be made to obtain it. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Burgess</persName> did not think the action
                        ruled out this possibility. He pointed out that the foreign governments were
                        getting a very favorable deal and they might be willing to agree to a
                        set-aside.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Garnett</persName> said that the two basic reasons of the
                        Department of Agriculture for proposing that accounts not be denominated in
                        dollars were to provide an overall incentive to the program and to encourage
                        investment of the local currencies in the private sector. On the latter
                        point they believed that their proposal would encourage a greater total
                        investment, that it would provide something of a deterrent for investment in
                        agriculture (since investment in the government sector was likely to be
                        predominantly in agriculture), and that it would be compatible with our
                        overall objective of encouraging private investment.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that he understood there was a strong majority in favor of
                        maintenance of value on the part of government-to-government transactions,
                        at least for the present. This would be reaffirming our previous position.
                        He thought we should explore as we went along the possibility of trying to
                        persuade the foreign countries to lend some of the funds to private
                        enterprise. If it were found subsequently that the way was absolutely
                        blocked the matter could then be reconsidered.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0335"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> expressed concern over whether the program
                        would have the effect of building up government institutions abroad.</p>
                    <p>Attention was called to the bracketed language in the first paragraph of the
                        draft action which referred to United States objectives “under that Act”. It
                        was agreed to delete the bracketed language.</p>

                    <p>This is in reply to your memorandum of June 23, 1956<note n="2"

                    <p>I agree with you that it should be made clear to our people, both in
                        Washington and in the field, that under <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        policy <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 loan agreements must provide
                        for maintenance of dollar value by requiring an exchange rate guarantee. I
                        also agree that this should be made clear to the foreign government at the
                        time that the sales agreement is negotiated in order to avoid future
                        misunderstandings such as have occurred in the cases of Spain and Thailand.
                        Accordingly I would suggest that there be a clause in the sales agreement
                        itself providing that the loan will require an exchange rate guarantee. Thus
                        there would be a written agreement on this matter and subsequent confusion
                        would be avoided.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, your proposal to send out a joint instruction to the field
                        along the lines of your attachment B is agreeable to me. We have some
                        suggestions for modification of wording, particularly to reflect the wording
                        of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> action on exchange guarantees,
                        but I am sure these can be resolved at the staff level. Also the instruction
                        should reflect the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> action of July 9<note

                        of agreements which provide that some portion of the local currency shall be

                        risk on the portion loaned. In the interests of harmonious interdepartmental
                        relations, the instruction should be cleared by the Departments of
                        Agriculture and Treasury.</p>
                    <p>I am unaware that our desk officers have delayed replies to field inquiries
                        or that the question of maintenance of value is regarded by them as a
                        negotiable item. In any case, the clearance of the instruction to the field
                        and the awareness of the exchange of communications between us serves to
                        bring the matter to the attention of our people and to make it sufficiently
                        clear to them that a matter of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> policy is
                        involved.</p>

                    <p>I am prepared, with some misgiving, to approve your proposal of May 18, 1956
                        with reference to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> responsibility for
                        Public Law 480.</p>
                    <p>I greatly fear that what I understand to be increased control will be
                        exercised in such a way as to create friction and nullify instead of promote
                        our policy objectives. It is human nature for one human being to enjoy
                        exercising power over another and to seek to extend and enlarge that power.
                        However, I am willing to give this a try.</p>
                    <p>I believe that reference should be made in your instruction to the

                        while very substantial, have been relatively stable. Some concern has been
                        expressed over the adequacy of our gold stocks. The table below illustrates
                        the statistical basis for this concern. (Also see Tab A.)<note n="2"

                    <p>It is apparent that if all foreign liquid dollar claims were converted into
                        gold, our stocks would be inadequate if the statutory reserve requirement is
                        also to be maintained.</p>
                    <p>What has given rise to the increase in claims of foreigners against us? The
                        attached table<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">Not printed.</note> shows that
                        imports of goods and <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0339"/>services and
                        capital outflow have together increased at an annual rate by $4.7 billion
                        while U.S. military expenditures abroad have increased by only $0.6 billion
                        since the year 1953 through June 30, 1956. Exports of goods and services
                        have not shown a corresponding increase and payment for these have been
                        offset in some degree through government aid and loans. Consequently, one
                        cannot point to a single item which would be, in large part, responsible for
                        the growth of foreign claims against us. (Tab B)</p>
                    <p>Are these claims dangerously large? Under today’s conditions, international
                        reserves (gold and dollars) of foreign countries are not considered
                        excessive in terms of the volume of world trade and financial obligations.
                        World trade has increased from $150 billion at the end of 1953 to an annual
                        rate in 1956 of about $200 billion. Invisible transactions (debt service,
                        shipping, tourism) have no doubt shown a similar increase.</p>
                    <p>A move on a substantial scale to convert dollar and readily negotiable
                        security holdings into dollars would only occur under two conditions: (1) a
                        firm and widespread belief that the price of gold is to be increased, or (2)
                        a lack of confidence in the future of the dollar. Our policy has left no
                        doubt about our intention not to increase the price of gold. There seems to
                        be little reason to expect a loss of confidence in the dollar. Sterling, the
                        only other widely used trading currency, has lost ground relative to the
                        dollar. Our exports have held up well and opportunities exist for increase
                        if restrictions against dollar goods are removed.</p>
                    <p>A further barrier against a flight from the dollar is our strong creditor
                        position both in the short and long run. Short term claims of Americans
                        against foreigners amount to about $1.6 billion.</p>
                    <p>There is always, of course, the danger of a short term movement from the
                        dollar to gold. For example, we lost $2.5 billions of gold from the end of
                        1949 to the end of 1953. No significant changes have since taken place in
                        our gold stocks.</p>
                    <p>World gold production (excluding USSR) is at the rate of $900 million
                        annually. This production for the last seven or eight years has been
                        absorbed abroad. Except for a brief period, foreign countries have shown a
                        distinct preference to hold their increased reserves in dollars rather than
                        in gold. This preference has been encouraged by the increased need for
                        dollars to finance trade as well as by the stability of the currency.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
                    <p>An increased effort on our part to expand exports should provide the best
                        insurance against any desire of foreign countries at <pb n="310"
                            xml:id="pg_310" facs="0340"/>once or over a period of time to convert
                        their dollar holdings into gold.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bob</hi>: Upon looking further into your proposal
                        for a reduction in the taxes on Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations I find
                        that Treasury’s thinking tends in the opposite direction. We have been told,
                        for example, that Treasury no longer supports an extension of the existing
                        14 point differential to foreign operations outside the Western Hemisphere
                        as proposed in the late H.R. 7725.</p>
                    <p>A major reason for this change seems to be a reluctance to grant tax relief
                        in special situations in view of the fact that the Administration has come
                        out categorically against any general tax relief at this time. It is being
                        argued that any discussion of tax benefits for the foreign operations of
                        American companies might lead to a reopening of the discussion of the
                        Western Hemisphere provisions themselves. As you know, the Congress approved
                        the Western Hemisphere legislation under rather exceptional wartime
                        conditions. Although this legislation is likely to remain undisturbed as
                        part of our established tax system, even the 14 point differential might be
                        in danger if the whole matter were laid open to attack.</p>
                    <p>I realize that what I have said so far is not addressed to the economic
                        merits of your proposal, and in the long run they should be decisive. There
                        are a number of possible steps in the field of taxation which would assist
                        in the expansion of business activity in underdeveloped countries and of
                        which we have not been making full use. Within the past few months we have
                        had several approaches from Latin American countries that wish to negotiate
                        tax treaties under which we would waive the collection of our income <pb
                            n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0341"/>taxes in certain well-defined cases
                        where the other country grants such a waiver temporarily in order to
                        encourage industrial development. In many cases the result would be a
                        greater reduction in the tax burden than you propose, but the reduction
                        would be temporary. I believe that at the moment this “tax sparing” device
                        stands a better chance of acceptance than a further widening of the Western
                        Hemisphere Corporation differential.</p>
                    <p>We are going to review the whole field thoroughly with Treasury in the near
                        future and at that time we shall go specifically into the matters raised in
                        your despatch 119.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Not printed. (<hi

                        determined opposition to your proposal, but I hope that we shall accomplish
                        at least part of your purpose, perhaps along tax sparing lines.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BEL1"
                            >Butz</persName></hi>: The following represents the views of the
                        Department of State with respect to the so called Cooley amendment to Public
                        Law 480 recently incorporated by the House in the Bill increasing the <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 authorization from $3 billion to $4
                        billion. As you know, the amendment provides that up to 25 percent of local
                        currency proceeds shall be made available to United States business
                        enterprises through the Export-Import Bank for business development and
                        trade expansion and for activities increasing the consumption of U.S.
                        agricultural products.</p>
                    <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0342"/>
                    <p>The Department believes that the objective of the Cooley amendment is a
                        desirable one as reflected by the fact the U.S. Government has for a year
                        now been engaged in negotiating set-asides of specific portions of <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales proceeds for loaning to private
                        enterprise, including U.S. enterprise, on a non-discriminatory basis through
                        established banking facilities in the host country. In the period during
                        which this policy has been in operation approximately $100 million in funds
                        have been set aside for this purpose. We believe this is a highly
                        encouraging result, especially when one recognizes that some of the
                        countries with which we have <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                        agreements are not now likely candidates for private enterprise, e.g.:
                        Poland, Yugoslavia. We recognize that there has been considerable criticism
                        from U.S. business of the present system perhaps largely because very few of
                        the funds have actually moved into the hands of private entrepreneurs. This
                        situation may be relieved as the funds actually start to move into private
                        channels. In any case, we have received no specific complaints of
                        discrimination from any U.S. firms. Under such circumstances we believe that
                        the present policy should be given an adequate opportunity to prove
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of reasons why the Cooley amendment might have adverse
                        effects on our foreign relations. It is quite possible that in a number of
                        countries it would be viewed as an attempt to discriminate in favor of U.S.
                        business as opposed to private enterprise in the country itself, especially
                        where the terms of our loans would be more favorable than those generally
                        available in the other country. Certain elements might seize the issue and
                        make charges of U.S. imperialism, however unjust. The consequence might be
                        that the host government would be most reluctant to enter into an agreement
                        with such a provision and thus possibly expose itself to charges of undue
                        obeisance to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>There are many cases, especially in Latin America, where available funds will
                        not meet the total desires of U.S. business firms. In such cases it would be
                        necessary for a U.S. agency to ration the available funds among U.S. firms.
                        In this connection it should be borne in mind that the local currency is a
                        claim on the resources of the host country in contrast to dollars which are
                        a claim on U.S. resources. There might be serious question as to the
                        desirability from a foreign policy point of view of having a U.S. agency
                        determine when, how and which U.S. firms should exercise such claims. It
                        might become necessary for the Export-Import Bank to engage in a
                        considerable amount of analysis of various proposals with a resulting need
                        for substantial increase in staff. The number of U.S. personnel abroad is
                        already a problem.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the local currencies under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 loans now made to foreign countries now contain an
                        exchange rate guarantee <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0343"/>which
                        assures the U.S. of an equivalent value in local currency when the loan is
                        repaid. It is assumed that such a requirement would not prevail in the case
                        of loans to U.S. business firms and in such circumstances, of course, if the
                        foreign currency were devalued the repayment received by the U.S. would be
                        substantially less in value than the amount loaned.</p>
                    <p>For the above reasons the Department believes it unwise to accept the
                        specific proposal contained in the Cooley amendment, even though its
                        objective is laudable. We would prefer to be given the opportunity to
                        proceed in our attempt to improve the present flexible system. In the long
                        run we may be of more help to U.S. enterprise in this manner than by an
                        attempt at a direct attack on the problem.</p>

                        were unanimously opposed to the amendment and our position was expressed in

                    <p>When it became apparent that despite our expressed position the conferees

                        the interested agencies must reach a meeting of minds concerning general
                        terms and conditions, specific procedures, etc., in order to incorporate
                        mutually agreed provisions in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales
                        agreements. Guidance is needed concerning these matters which will probably
                        be considered in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>To this end it is recommended that the Department favor interest rates and
                        repayment periods on such local currency loans to United States private
                        firms which are similar to the terms available to private firms in the money
                        market within each particular country. More favorable terms on loans under
                        this authority to United States firms as compared with terms available to
                        local firms would doubtless give rise to sharp criticism and ill-will and
                        would mitigate against the willingness of other countries to enter into such
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that <persName corresp="#p_CVE1">Cooley</persName> amendment
                        loans would not be administered through or by the other government. It is
                        recommended therefore that for these loans the Department oppose the
                        maintenance of value provision which is standard policy for loans made to
                        the other governments. The other government would be understandably
                        reluctant to agree to such a provision on funds it did not manage and a
                        private borrower would not find a loan attractive which required this
                        condition.</p>

                    <p>I understand from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWV1">Turnage</persName> of
                            <gloss target="#t_OFD1">OFD</gloss> that an informal interagency group
                        has been working with the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">EX–IM Bank</gloss> to
                        establish procedures for implementing the amendment. When these procedures
                        are further along, <gloss target="#t_OFD1">OFD</gloss> is planning to
                        consult with the geographic bureaus, possibly through a meeting to discuss
                        the proposals under consideration. The preliminary thinking thus far
                        indicates that most of the screening of the proposed loans will be done by
                        the other countries rather than by the U.S., since the Cooley Amendment is
                        drawn in such broad terms that <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">EX–IM
                            Bank</gloss> considers that all that is required here is a general
                        evaluation of the creditworthiness of the private borrower. Other countries,
                        however, will probably set up much more comprehensive screening standards.
                        In addition, <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">EX–IM Bank</gloss> is suggesting
                        that interest rates charged to private borrowers should be similar to the
                        interest rates for similar projects in the country in which the investment
                        will be made. It is not expected to require a provision for maintenance of
                        value. Repayment terms will probably be tailored to the project, rather than
                        set at the normal 40 year repayment period for other <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 loans. It is <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0346"
                            /><gloss target="#t_OFD1">OFD</gloss>’s recommendation that in
                        negotiating these loans, the U.S. start at the 25% figure so that there can
                        be no allegations later that the executive agencies were responsible for
                        damping down the program.</p>
                    <p>It is generally believed there will be very little business under the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CVE1">Cooley</persName> Amendment. The Latin
                        American countries, where there would be the most interest, will have
                        relatively small <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 programs in the next
                        year. In the European area, Poland, Yugoslavia and Spain will probably
                        receive the largest <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 allocations. It is
                        unlikely that the <persName corresp="#p_CVE1">Cooley</persName> Amendment
                        will be drawn on in Poland and Yugoslavia, while in Spain there are likely
                        to be so many uses for the local currencies, there will probably not be many
                        calls for <persName corresp="#p_CVE1">Cooley</persName>-type loans. All in
                        all, it is considered that the amendment will involve severe negotiating
                        difficulties in a program already replete with these. It is not expected
                        that the U.S. will derive much leverage in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                        480 negotiations from the amendment.</p>

                            requesting the Council’s advice on the Bank’s proposed loan terms under
                            the Cooley amendment. These proposed terms were as follows:<p>“1.
                                Interest will be charged at a rate equivalent to those prevailing
                                for comparable loans in the country involved.</p>
                            <p>“2. The repayment period will be roughly comparable to those used
                                under dollar loans made by the Export-Import Bank to foreign private
                                enterprises.</p>
                            <p>“3. The loan agreements will not contain a maintenance of value
                                clause.” (National Archives and Records Service, RG 56, Treasury

                        on these loans at rates approximately equivalent to those prevailing in the
                        foreign countries for comparable loans by local lending institutions. Since
                        these would be local currency loans, the Bank should not compete unfairly
                        with local lending institutions by charging rates lower than prevailing
                        rates, and would not be able to make loans at interest rates higher than the
                        prevailing rates. As to the maturities of the loans, the Bank proposed to
                        follow the pattern of maturities on its dollar loans. With respect to the
                        proposal of the Bank that the loans not include a maintenance-of-value
                        clause, Mr. <persName>Blowers</persName> noted that the loans will be
                        disbursed entirely in local currency, that repayments of principal and
                        payments of interest will be in local currency, and that the currencies
                        collected by the Bank will be turned over to the Treasury Department. In
                        view of the complete local currency character of the loans, the Bank did not
                        feel that a maintenance-of-value requirement in terms of dollars was
                        appropriate, and felt that if such a requirement were imposed the result
                        would be that no loans would be made under the program. Moreover, the
                        interest rates to be charged would undoubtedly bear a relation to the degree
                        of inflation in the countries in which the loans would be made, and would
                        thus provide some protection against depreciation. At such relatively high
                        rates of interest a maintenance-of-value requirement appeared
                        unreasonable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> inquired whether charging
                        the relatively high local interest rates was expected to lead to criticism
                        of the Bank on the grounds that it was charging usurious rates of interest.
                        Mr. <persName>Blowers</persName> replied that some amount of criticism was
                        to be expected of any proposal, but that the Bank felt that charging the
                        local rates was the only reasonable proposal under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLU1">Stambaugh</persName> expressed concurrence
                        with Mr. <persName>Blower</persName>’s presentation, and commented that
                        while experience with the program might change the views of the Bank, the
                        present views of the Bank were as stated.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> noted that the loans under
                        Section 104(e) of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 would be comparable
                        to loans by foreign development banks rather than to loans to foreign
                        governments under Section 104(g),<note n="4" xml:id="d126fn4">Section 104
                            (g) of Public Law 480 provided that the President could enter into
                            agreements with friendly nations to use the foreign currencies accruing
                            under Title I of the act for loans to promote multilateral trade and
                            economic development; for text, see 68 Stat. 457.</note> on which
                        maintenance of value is required. He saw a problem, however, in setting
                        aside 20 percent of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 sales proceeds for
                        U.S. Government use and 25 percent for loans under the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CVE1">Cooley</persName> Amendment, a total of 45 percent,
                        without a maintenance-of-value requirement. He expressed the hope that the
                        Export-Import Bank would avoid stressing the absence of a
                        maintenance-of-value requirement, so as to minimize the repercussions on the
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans under Section 104(g) and on
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> loans under Section 402 of the
                        Mutual Security Act, on which maintenance of value was also required.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question as to the criteria which the Bank would apply to
                        the Section 104(e) loans, Mr. <persName>Blowers</persName> replied that in
                        general the Bank would require that the loans be bankable loans with a
                        reasonable assurance of repayment, in accordance with the usual criteria of
                        the Bank. The Bank, however, recognized the general purposes of the <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Act, and might accordingly be willing to
                        take unusual risks under appropriate circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> expressed concurrence in
                        the Export-Import Bank proposal, commenting that it was important to accord
                        national treatment in the administration of the loan program. Denomination
                        of the loans in dollars would result in few or no loans, and foreign
                        governments would be unlikely to approve individual loans that put their
                        nationals at a disadvantage. With respect to interest rates, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> commented that rates that might
                        appear usurious in one country might not appear usurious in others.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the question of appropriate accounting for loan
                        operations under the Cooley Amendment, especially with reference to a
                        suggestion that the loans be denominated in dollars as a means of relating
                        these loan operations to the dollar loan operations of the Export-Import
                        Bank. Mr. <persName>Blowers</persName> stated that the Bank had considered
                        this suggestion carefully and felt that it would not accomplish any
                        necessary end. He stated that the Bank did not intend to keep dual currency
                        accounts, but would keep accounts on these loans only in terms of local
                        currencies. The program would thus have no effect on the outcome of the
                        Bank’s dollar loan operations. The Chairman noted that the Treasury had
                        considered whether it would be feasible to establish a reserve account as a
                            <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0350"/>means of reflecting to some
                        extent the provision against exchange risks afforded by the levels of the
                        interest rates, but had discarded the idea as unworkable. He suggested,
                        however, that the Export-Import Bank might consider setting up memorandum
                        accounts for the <persName corresp="#p_CVE1">Cooley</persName> Amendment
                        loans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName> expressed agreement with the
                        proposals of the Bank as to the interest rates and maturities on the loans,
                        but proposed that the Bank give the borrowers an option of paying low
                        interest rates with a maintenance-of-value clause, or higher interest rates
                        without a maintenance-of-value clause.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed this proposal at some length. Doubt was expressed that
                        interest at the rates for Export-Import Bank dollar loans would induce
                        borrowers to offer a maintenance-of-value undertaking, and it was suggested
                        that the option might conceivably encourage speculation. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> commented that the option might
                        have an undesirable effect on Section 104(g) loans in that it would direct
                        attention to the question of maintenance of value. Mr.
                            <persName>Blowers</persName> stated that the Bank had considered such an
                        option, and was unwilling to adopt the suggestion since it put a dollar
                        denomination on a loan program which was entirely a local currency program.
                        Moreover, the option would impose a burden of choice upon officials of
                        borrowing corporations, who might conceivably become involved in
                        difficulties if future events appeared to indicate that their choice of
                        option had been unfortunate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Zaglits</persName> stated that Agriculture fully supported the
                        Export-Import Bank proposal as consistent with the Congressional intent that
                        the loans should be local currency loans. Agriculture recognized that the
                        program would create problems for <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, but
                        saw no way of avoiding these problems in view of the Congressional
                        intent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hutchinson</persName> informed the Council that the Bureau of
                        the Budget was concerned over the maintenance-of-value aspects of the Bank’s
                        proposal because of its effect on <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> loans
                        and other <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans, and because of the
                        public policy aspects of loans to individuals in situations offering the
                        possibility of substantial windfall profits. He noted that the
                        Administration had opposed the Cooley Amendment but was nonetheless obliged
                        to carry it out, but he saw no foreign policy or other reason for unduly
                        lenient terms for the loans. The Chairman commented that the Administration
                        had a strong obligation to administer the program in good faith in the light
                        of the Congressional intent that the loans be made in local currency.</p>
                    <p>The question of whether every loan had to be approved by the foreign
                        governments was discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName>
                        felt that such specific approval would inhibit the loans and would,
                        therefore, inhibit United States investment abroad which might be associated
                        with the loans. Mr. <persName>Blowers</persName> replied that the Bank had
                        an open mind on the <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0351"/>question and
                        would seek the advice of State and Commerce in working it out.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Chairman announced that it was clear
                        that the Council offered no objection to the Export-Import Bank proposal,
                        with the understanding that the program would not prejudice the requirement
                        of maintenance of value on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans under
                        Section 104(g) or on loans under the Development Loan Fund.</p>
                    <p>The Council also agreed that proposals for individual loans under Section
                        104(e) should be submitted for Council consideration until some experience
                        had been gained under the program, and that at some future time the Council
                        would review procedures for handling these loans.</p>
                    <p>The Council took the following action (Action No. 1049): <quote

                                target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 Loans</hi></p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> to
                        present the question for the consideration of the Council. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> commented that the interest rates
                        on loans under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act (<gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480) and on Mutual Security loans were out of
                        line with the cost of money to the Treasury and had not been adjusted since
                        their adoption to reflect the world-wide increase in interest rates (see
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No. 2119). He noted also
                        the Presidential statement regarding the importance of charging interest on
                        US Government loans sufficient to cover the cost of money to the Government,
                        and referred also to the Administration bill which had been introduced in
                        the Congress along these lines. The <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        therefore proposed that the interest rates on the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 loans be increased by 1 percent, to 4 percent for dollar
                        repayment and 5 percent for repayment in local currency, and further
                        proposed that interest accrue from the date of disbursement rather than
                        after the <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0354"/>3-year interest-free
                        period which was applicable to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans
                        in the past. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Schaefer</persName> thought that
                        there was general agreement that it was desirable to raise these rates by 1
                        percent and to abandon the interest-free period, but he understood that the
                        Department of State wished to reserve the right to make exceptions in
                        certain cases.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> stated that the staff of the State Department
                        had felt that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans were different
                        from the kind of loan which was the subject of the proposed legislation
                        requiring that interest rates cover the cost of money, the cost of
                        administration and the risk. It was thought that the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 loans themselves involved no cost to the Treasury, since
                        the currency lent was foreign currency derived from sales of surplus
                        commodities, and might have been of little use apart from the loans. In view
                        of these differences from ordinary loans, State had thought it desirable to
                        set the interest rates on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans in the
                        light of the foreign policy objectives of the loan program. The Department
                        of State, however, could also see the merit of having these rates reflect
                        the general rise in interest rates. After discussions of the matter with the
                        regional bureaus and with the Secretary of State, it had been determined
                        that the Department of State would agree to the proposed increase to 4 and 5
                        percent, provided that the Department of State could reserve the right to
                        set the rate at lower levels in cases involving serious foreign policy
                        implications.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the State Department proposal, and the question of
                        whether under the State proposal, individual cases for which exceptional
                        treatment was proposed should be referred to the Council for its
                        consideration. Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName> pointed out that if the State
                        Department position was accepted it would involve reserving to State the
                        right to make exceptions in cases involving serious foreign policy
                        implications, so that to have formal <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        consideration of each proposed exception did not appear to be appropriate.
                        The Chairman suggested that the point might be met by providing that there
                        would be prior consultation with the Council in each exceptional case. Mr.
                            <persName>Dillon</persName> agreed that this would be appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> noted that the purpose of
                        the proposed legislation regarding interest rates on Government loans was to
                        increase the rates on certain domestic loan programs, such as the 2 percent
                        Rural Electrification loans, to the going level of rates. The Budget Bureau
                        felt that the passage of the bill in the next session of the Congress might
                        be endangered if it became known that foreigners were obtaining <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans at lower rates than those which
                        would result from passage of the legislation.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed suggestions advanced by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1"
                            >Waugh</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName>
                        for increasing the spread between the rates for dollar repayment and the
                        rates for local currency repayment, in order to <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325"
                            facs="0355"/>increase the incentive for repayment in dollars. There was
                        general agreement with the logic of such proposals, but the consensus was
                        that a spread large enough to provide an effective incentive for dollar
                        payment might involve an unduly low dollar repayment rate or an unduly high
                        local currency rate.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the question of whether granting exceptions in some
                        cases might make it difficult to apply the higher rates in other cases. Mr.
                            <persName>Zaglits</persName> informed the Council that the Department of
                        Agriculture favored the proposed rise in the interest rates, and suggested
                        that an alternative to granting exceptionally low rates might be to provide
                        other forms of assistance to the countries involved.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion the Chairman expressed the view of the
                        Council that the interest rates on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                        loans should be raised to 4 percent for dollar repayment and 5 percent for
                        repayment in local currencies, to accrue from date of disbursement, with
                        provision for the granting of lower rates in cases involving serious foreign
                        policy implications, and with the understanding that there would be
                        opportunity for prior consultation with the Council in each such exceptional
                        case. It was also agreed that the higher level of interest rates would apply
                        to transactions under the authority available for the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 program for the fiscal year 1958, and that the old rates
                        and terms would continue to apply to loans negotiated under the authority
                        pertaining to prior fiscal years. The Council also agreed that the decision
                        applied only to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans, and that the
                        terms of loans under the Development Loan Fund would be considered at a
                        later date.</p>
                    <p>The Council took the following action (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        Action No. 1054): <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The National Advisory Council advises the administering agencies
                                that the minimum interest rates on loans to governments under the
                                Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as
                                amended, from funds made available for the fiscal year ending June
                                30, 1958 should generally be 4% when payment is made in United
                                States dollars, and 5% when payment is made in the foreign currency,
                                provided that exceptions to this policy may be made where serious
                                foreign policy implications are involved. Loans to governments,
                                whether repaid in dollars or in foreign currency, should be made
                                with appropriate provisions guaranteeing the dollar value of the
                                loan against changes in exchange rates. Interest on such loans
                                should accrue from the date of disbursement without the waiting
                                period provided by loan contracts made under previous fiscal year

                        <p>At the end of 1956 the total gold stock of the United States amounted to
                            $22 billion. The legally required gold reserves for the Federal Reserve
                            notes and deposits then outstanding amounted to $12 billion. This left
                            $10 billion of free gold as compared with $161/2 billion of foreign
                            liquid dollar holdings.</p>
                        <p>In the seven years from end-1949 to end-1956 there had been a steady
                            decline in the excess of our gold holdings over reserve requirements
                            plus foreign dollar holdings. This resulted from a combination of
                            factors. The gold stock of the U.S. fell by $21/2 billion—i.e., from
                            $241/2 billion to $22 billion. The growth in our monetary supply over
                            the same period resulted in an increase of nearly $11/2 billion in
                            required gold reserves. Thus, free gold reserves declined from nearly
                            $14 billion at the end of 1949 to $10 billion at the end of 1956.</p>
                        <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0357"/>
                        <p>The most striking change over this seven-year period was the doubling of
                            foreign liquid dollar holdings from more than $8 billion to nearly
                            $161/2 billion. At the end of 1956, foreign liquid dollar holdings
                            exceeded the free gold reserves by $61/2 billion, whereas at the end of
                            1949 free gold reserves had exceeded foreign liquid dollar holdings by
                            $51/2 billion.</p>
                        <p>U.S. balance-of-payments data show that the total gold and dollar gain by
                            foreigners from transactions with the United States during this same
                            seven-year period, counting their long-term investments in the U.S.
                            private sector as well as their net gains of gold and liquid dollars,
                            has amounted to $121/2 billion. The outflow of dollar funds from the
                            United States, which made possible this foreign accumulation of dollar
                            assets in addition to the purchase of $129 billion of U.S. goods and
                            services by foreigners, included the following major components: <list>
                                <item>$981/2 billion from American purchases of foreign goods and
                                    services, exclusive of U.S. military expenditures abroad;</item>
                                <item>$171/2 billion from net U.S. Government grants and net
                                    movement of U.S. Government loans and short-term capital;</item>
                                <item>$141/2 billion from U.S. military expenditures abroad,
                                    including offshore procurement;</item>
                                <item>$10 billion from the net outflow of private U.S.
                                    capital.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Since the fall of 1956 there has been a definite pause in the persistent
                            accumulation of dollars by foreigners which until then had prevailed
                            since 1949. For the six months October 1956–March 1957 U.S.
                            balance-of-payments data show a total gold and dollar loss by foreigners
                            from transactions with us amounting to more than $500 million, compared
                            with a foreign gain of more than $800 million during the same six-month
                            period a year earlier. The April–June quarter of 1957 brought a foreign
                            gain of nearly $200 million in gold and total dollars again, but this is
                            small compared with earlier trends and the data on foreign liquid dollar
                            holdings so far available indicate that the July–September quarter will
                            probably show a further foreign loss of liquid dollars. These
                            developments have of course reflected the Suez crisis plus unusual
                            losses by a few major countries with special balance-of-payments
                            difficulties. It remains to be seen whether or not they also reflect
                            some more lasting modification of previous trends.</p>
                        <p>Although the liquid dollar holdings of foreigners do not constitute a
                            specific claim on our gold reserves and we have no legal obligation to
                            convert them into gold, it has for many years been our policy to do so
                            upon request from foreign governments and central banks. As long as we
                            are not prepared to set up an extensive system of controls over foreign
                            transactions by American firms and individuals, this policy is necessary
                            to maintain a stable international value <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328"
                                facs="0358"/>for the dollar. Abandonment of this policy would have
                            such widespread and unstabilizing effects that as a practical matter it
                            could only be considered under most unusual circumstances.</p>

                        just after the war has been overcome. In 1949 this problem crippled our
                        Allies. It is good to know that our various programs have helped them to get
                        back on their feet. Their economic representatives to the United Nations say
                        that their reserves of gold and dollars are still lower in proportion to
                        their total trade than they were in the pre-war period. They are worried
                        about what might happen if their sales to us go down. Perhaps this is
                        because their build-up of liquid dollar holdings has been reversed during
                        the past year.</p>

                    <p>This memo summarizes some of my recent studies of Eximbank policies. It
                        suggests an expansion of Eximbank lending, in order to help meet the needs
                        for international development credit and to contribute to the rebuilding of
                        the international capital market.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Need for Foreign Lending</hi></p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the importance of foreign investment and
                        foreign lending. The potential gains to the United States are all
                        familiar—better customers, more and cheaper raw materials, stronger allies,
                        and a strengthening of the forces of free enterprise. If we are to end
                        grants, it seems logical that we should step up lending. Most of the world
                        is rapidly getting in better shape to support the service of sound loans
                        made on a business basis.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Rebuilding the International Capital
                            Market</hi></p>
                    <p>It is often argued that there is a conflict between public and private
                        lending, because loans from public funds make it unnecessary for the foreign
                        borrower to pay the price or create the conditions that would be necessary
                        to obtain private capital. This danger is very real. But it should also be
                        possible to encourage private lending and investment by means of public
                        loans. It should be possible, for instance, to negotiate for fair treatment
                        of private <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0360"/>investors in connection
                        with the granting of Eximbank loans, through investment treaties or less
                        formally, and to emphasize loans that would help a country to put its house
                        in order, as well as loans concentrating on the framework of public
                        services—like power and transport—needed by private investors. A rate of
                        interest could be charged that would allow private capital to compete. All
                        these approaches have been used in the past to some extent, but they
                        probably could be employed more systematically and explicitly. This would
                        mean to use public lending as a positive instrument for rebuilding the
                        private capital market.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Eximbank or International Bank?</hi></p>
                    <p>A second question that inevitably comes up in this connection is the relation
                        between Eximbank and International Bank. Why should not all developmental
                        lending be left to the International Bank, which was established for that
                        purpose? In fact, the Eximbank has been under injunction from the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to stay away from loans that the
                        International Bank could or would make. There is no doubt that for long-term
                        loans that are part of a national development program, the International
                        Bank is better set up. A role in this field for the Eximbank nevertheless
                        seems desirable for several reasons. First, there are the limitations
                        imposed upon the International Bank by its statute: the need to get the
                        foreign government’s guarantee on loans to private borrowers and the
                        limitation of its financing to no more than the import cost of projects
                        that, moreover, must be directly productive. These two latter restrictions
                        admittedly seem to be handled rather flexibly. Secondly, it seems desirable
                        for the U.S. Government to have an arm like the Eximbank. The International
                        Bank cannot be primarily interested in the special concerns of the United
                        States, such as fostering closer relations with Latin America or stimulating
                        strategic materials production. Finally, although it is clearly undesirable
                        to have active competition among official agencies, it is probably equally
                        undesirable to put an agency in a position where it enjoys too comfortable a
                        monopoly. This aspect is emphasized by the fact that the International Bank

                    <p>The scale of Eximbank operations has been expanding in recent months, after
                        contracting severely in 1953 and early 1954. During that earlier period, the
                        Treasury seems to have frowned upon Eximbank lending, as tending to increase
                        the deficit. Potential borrowers <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0361"
                        />were made to feel that their loan inquiries were not welcome; new business
                        consequently dried up. Then during the summer of 1954, Senator Capehart<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">Homer E. Capehart (<gloss target="#t_R1"
                                >R</gloss>–Ind.), Chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency
                            Committee, 1953–1954.</note> put on his campaign for an expansion of the
                        Bank’s operations, mainly in the direction of straight exporter credits,
                        which the American exporter prefers to developmental lending to foreign
                        countries. An amount of $500 million was added to the Bank’s loan authority,
                        bringing the total to $1,500 million. The Citizens’ Advisory Committee set
                        up by Senator Capehart came out with a report urging an expansion of
                        Eximbank lending. In the hearings on the confirmations of the Bank’s new
                        directors, Senators Capehart and Bricker<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4"
                                ><persName>John W. Bricker</persName> (<gloss target="#t_R1"
                                >R</gloss>–Ohio), member of the Senate Banking and Currency
                            Committee.</note> expressed impatience with what they called the Bank’s
                        deference to the International Bank, although it was not quite clear whether
                        they meant to attack the existing division of functions between the two
                        institutions. The attitude of the Treasury also seems to have softened.</p>
                    <p>Under the influence of this prodding and removal of restraints, the Eximbank
                        has expanded its program. It has set up a system of credit lines to
                        exporters to simplify the financing of routine transactions. It also appears
                        to have accepted participation in the export financing plans of the Chase.
                        The projection of annual credit authorizations submitted to the Budget
                        Bureau shows a rise from $250 million in fiscal 1954 to $460 million in
                        fiscal 1955 and $665 million in fiscal 1956. Nevertheless, actual
                        disbursement will continue to lag, as a result of the low volume of
                        commitments in 1953 and 1954. Net disbursements, in excess of repayments,
                        are projected at only $100 million in fiscal 1955 and at $30 million in
                        fiscal 1956. However, actual authorizations during the first seven months of
                        fiscal 1955 are reported to be running about 30 percent above the
                        projections.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Expansion of Operations</hi></p>
                    <p>Under the Bank’s statutes, the volume of operations is subject within a very
                        wide range to the discretion of the management. It is quite possible to
                        argue that the recent shift in policy has accomplished all that was
                        required. In view of the unfilled foreign demand for American capital,
                        however, and the feeble state of the international private capital market, a
                        more deliberate and broader program deserves consideration. The following
                        measures, in ascending order of effectiveness and difficulty, might be
                        taken: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>A clearer indication to potential borrowers that the Bank really
                                welcomes applications. The contrary impression reportedly still <pb
                                    n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0362"/>seems to prevail, for
                                instance, in some Latin American quarters and even in our Embassies
                                there.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>A more constructive attitude toward applications in the making. In
                                some cases loan commitments have been made under which no feasible
                                projects have been brought in. It should be possible for the Bank to
                                help in the surveying and financial setting up of the project. In
                                other cases, there are projects potentially suitable for an Eximbank
                                loan where the Bank could encourage inquiries without putting itself
                                in the position of “soliciting loans.” Here the Bank’s tradition of
                                having only a minimum staff seems to stand in the way of
                                constructive lending.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>A broader view of the meaning of a “productive project.” Recently
                                the Bank turned down a loan to finance the equipment of a hospital
                                in Peru. The <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> asked it to
                                reconsider. Wider acceptance of non-self-liquidating projects that
                                clearly strengthen the economy would open up new areas for
                                loans.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>More financing of the local expenditure component in development
                                projects. At present the Bank will do this only in small amounts, if
                                at all, since this kind of financing is not tied to the furtherance
                                of any particular American exports. The Bank does regard it as
                                justifiable under its statutes, however, if it is required to get
                                certain exports moving. Actually, unless the dollars loaned for such
                                domestic financing go into reserves somewhere in the world, they
                                almost inevitably must come back to the United States directly or
                                indirectly and increase our sales. A more generous attitude on such
                                financing of the local cost of investment projects would make many
                                projects feasible that are not so now.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Financing of Eximbank Activities</hi></p>
                    <p>The Eximbank proposes to increase the proportion of its loans to be
                        refinanced in the market with its guarantee. The <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss> has often urged the Bank in that direction, but has never
                        made it mandatory. For the Bank the choice between direct loans and
                        guaranteed loans is a matter of relative indifference, since both obligate
                        its loan authority equally. But from the budgetary and public debt point of
                        view, it makes all the difference.</p>
                    <p>The Bank apparently often encounters rather stiff demands on the part of
                        institutional investors. It might be possible to reduce these demands by
                        more intensive spadework, and perhaps by making the form of the guarantee
                        more attractive. It would seem that here is the Bank’s chance to prepare the
                        American capital market for a resumption of foreign portfolio lending. In
                        some cases, the Bank already has been able to place the shorter parts of
                        amortizable loans in the market without its guarantee. As world conditions
                        improve, the maturities that can be sold in this way are likely to lengthen.
                        It may become possible to place securities with limited guarantees—as to
                        interest only, or principal only, or part of principal. The possibility of
                        foreign bond issues guaranteed by the Eximbank might also be <pb n="333"
                            xml:id="pg_333" facs="0363"/>considered, if a way can be found to keep
                        the use of the money under the control of the Bank.</p>
                    <p>The problems of refinancing the Eximbank’s loans in the market appear to have
                        been less thoroughly explored than most other phases of its operations. It
                        is true that guarantee financing outside the debt and the budget seems to be
                        attracting some criticism at this time. But the Eximbank has operated in
                        this way for some years; it is doing so within rather narrow limits set by
                        Congress. This area therefore seems to deserve further investigation.</p>

                            established by P. L. 108, enacted July 10, 1953 (67 Stat. 142), to study
                            the workings of the various departments and agencies of the Executive
                            branch and to make recommendations which would improve efficiency and
                            eliminate waste in government operations. The Commission submitted 20
                            reports to Congress in the 2 years of its existence. For an overview of
                            the Commission’s findings, see its <hi rend="italic">Final Report to
                                Congress</hi> (June 1955).</note> has just made several
                        recommendations about the Eximbank from which this memo diverges in some
                        respects. Among these recommendations are the following: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>To eliminate short-term export financing by the Bank.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>To appropriate annually through Congressional action the funds
                                required for the Bank’s lending.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The reason given for the first suggestion is that the Eximbank finances only
                        2 percent of our annual exports, and that this marginal amount is not worth
                        compromising the principle of avoiding government competition with business.
                        With this argument one is bound to sympathize. It happens, however, that the
                        Chase project probably falls at least partly into this area. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> Commission report would kill off,
                        in this instance, one of the most interesting pieces of the very private
                        initiative that it sets out to protect.</p>
                    <p>The recommendation for an annual appropriation of lending funds seems to have
                        a similar effect. It argues against the principle of guarantees—at least
                        that appears to be implicit in the idea of an annual appropriation for
                        lending, in place of an authorization as hitherto. By inhibiting guarantees,
                        it would stymie one of the possible methods by which the Eximbank could help
                        foreign borrowers get back into the private capital market.</p>

                        private investment in our Foreign Economic Policy. Very appropriately, all
                        of us have devoted a great deal of attention to the investment climate in
                        the underdeveloped areas. On the basis of the facts and certain evaluations
                        of the facts, it is possible, however, that we are neglecting another vital
                        consideration in the use of private investment for the promotion of U.S.
                        Foreign Economic Policy objectives. I refer to the positive stimulation of
                        private capital and entrepreneurs in their consideration of investment
                        opportunities in the underdeveloped world.</p>
                    <p>In our concern about investment climate and attractions in the “host”
                        country, we may lose sight of the fact that investors in the United States
                        are confronted with equally, or relatively more, attractive investment
                        opportunities at or near home. In some cases, this obstacle is supplemented
                        by something of a psychological blockage with regard to the consideration of
                        investments of their or their stockholders’ funds in areas near to the
                        “communist heartland.”</p>
                    <p>The hard fact is that, even with <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss>
                        treaties, double taxation treaties, the investment guaranty agreements and
                        certain feasible efforts to legislate an investment climate, investment is
                        not likely to flow into the underdeveloped areas in sufficient quantities in
                        the foreseeable future. The countries of the area know this fact, and this
                        knowledge retards the enthusiasm with which they approach our programs for
                        the promotion of a more favorable investment climate in those countries.</p>
                    <p>In any case these countries may tend in their critical situations to look to
                        forced-draft, public sector development as an immediate means of moving
                        toward their essential developmental objectives— no matter how inadequate
                        that means may be in the long run.</p>

                    <p>While I would not attempt to speak authoritatively for other areas, I believe
                        that Asian attitudes and problems underlying the general need for positive
                        and rapid U.S. stimulation of American investment in the underdeveloped
                        areas of the world—and Asia in particular—can be highlighted by specific
                        examples drawn from recent events in India. In overly-brief form the
                        situation may be outlined as follows:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">1. Admiration and Disillusionment in China:</hi></p>
                    <p>Prime Minister Nehru<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime
                            Minister of India.</note> returned from his visit to Peking both
                        disillusioned and impressed. Before going to Peking he was concerned with
                        the need for economic progress to support and further the democratic
                        institutions of his newly independent country. He returned from Peking with
                        what appears to be a “firming up” of his dislike for the communist
                        dictatorial methods and system. He was impressed with what might be called
                        “monuments” of economic progress in China—the dams, the roads, the
                        railroads, etc. He was disillusioned by the lack of concern for the people
                        as individuals and the lack of economic development which reaches down to
                        those people.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">2. Systems on Trial:</hi></p>
                    <p>He returned to India with the firm view that the democratic system, which
                        India espouses, and the communist dictatorial system are in competition—and
                        that the Indian system is on “trial” with regard to the progress and
                        benefits it can produce for the people.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">3. Unequal Bases of Competition:</hi></p>
                    <p>Although Nehru has not specifically stated as much, it would seem fair to
                        observe that our competition for the minds of the people of free Asia is
                        handicapped (in one sense) by the harsh fact that the free peoples’
                        comparison of the two systems will be made in large part on the basis of the
                        “monuments” or more ostentatious economic achievements which they see or
                        hear about. Increases in national product in free Asia must be reflected in
                        immediate perceptible benefits for its free peoples while providing
                        investment for “monuments” of longer-range benefit to the people. This means
                        that free Asia must far surpass any actual economic development in communist
                        countries in order to show a competitive advantage. The task, therefore, is
                        doubly difficult.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">4. Forced-Draft Development:</hi></p>
                    <p>After his return from China and up to the present time, Nehru’s statements
                        have evidenced his redoubled concern for the “trial” facing Indian democracy
                        in the competition with the communist system—a concern which may have led
                        him into faulty courses of action. He has reemphasized the need for rapid
                        economic progress in India. It is probably fair to say that in casting about
                        in his own mind for means of achieving this rapid progress, he came to the
                        tentative conclusion that the most ready means of achieving forced-draft
                        development lay in the hands of the Government—the public sector. However,
                        his statements tend to indicate that, despite a distinct socialist turn, he
                        is troubled and somewhat undecided about the approach to progress by the
                        people through the private sector of the Indian economy. For example, Nehru
                        has reiterated his inability to define his so-called “Socialist Pattern.” He
                        states that the private sector of the Indian economy is important to
                        economic progress and that a private sector to be effective cannot be a
                        private sector in name only. In sum, he and his Government have shown some
                        ambivalence on the role of private investment in Indian economic
                        development.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">5. The Challenge of the Private Sector:</hi></p>
                    <p>The Indian Government’s present emphasis on the public sector is based in
                        part upon the facts that (a) private investment in India has not been able
                        to meet its anticipated goals under the first five-year plan, and (b) that
                        foreign private investment would probably not be forthcoming in sufficient
                        quantities in the foreseeable future even with a more favorable investment
                        climate. While this picture appears bleak, it offers a certain challenge and
                        opportunity in that India’s second five-year plan calls for a surprising
                        increase in private investment, raising the private sector to the equivalent
                        of almost $4.5 billion, or some 40 to 50% of the present tentative figure
                        for the entire second five-year plan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">6. Probable Consequences of a Private Sector Failure in
                            Future Development:</hi></p>
                    <p>While there may be some differences of opinion as to whether the above facts
                        and evaluations constitute a situation which is a challenge and an
                        opportunity to United States foreign economic policy, it is certainly
                        possible to forecast that, in the event of failure of the private sector in
                        the second five-year plan, India will definitely shift to a “Socialist
                        Pattern” which will place complete reliance upon the public sector for
                        further economic development.</p>

                                    and vitality of the less developed countries of the free world
                                    and is supporting many constructive programs, both national and
                                    international, to effect this purpose. However, we do not
                                    believe that a global development fund would be an effective
                                    instrument at this time. Until international disarmament frees
                                    resources for constructive work, such a fund would have
                                    difficulty in attracting substantial contributions. Its
                                    operations would be largely of a token character. A significant
                                    part of its resources would go into overhead and a significant
                                    part of its energies would go into efforts at coordination.
                                    Because of its global responsibilities, it would have to spread
                                    itself thinly over many continents. We are not prepared to
                                    support the proposed international machinery at this

                    <p>The United States position on <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> is
                        well-known, and the amendments proposed in the <persName corresp="#p_SR1"
                            >Scheyven</persName> report do not alter that position. Only a brief
                        statement of the United States Position should be necessary.</p>
                    <p>The unwillingness of the United States to support the establishment of the
                        special fund will not, however, dispose of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>. The proponents will most probably wish to recommend to
                        the General Assembly that a working party of governments be established to
                        draft the Articles of Agreement of the special fund, taking into account the
                            <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Scheyven</persName> report and the views of
                        governments thereon as expressed in the Economic and Social Council and the
                        General Assembly. It is in our interest to delay such action. In this
                        connection, should an effort be made to have adopted any resolution of the
                        kind indicated in paragraph 3 of the US Position, the following points
                        should be made, as appropriate: That the United States is not prepared to
                        contribute to a fund such as <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> at
                        this time; that the United States is not prepared to participate in any
                        Working Party set up for the purpose of bringing <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> into existence; and that the establishment of <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> at this time might tend to make more
                        difficult the eventual participation in such a fund by countries which are
                        not now prepared to contribute. The United States Delegation should,
                        therefore, give its support to alternative proposals consistent with the
                        United States position, that would forestall such action. A reasonable
                        alternative is to refer the report to governments for study and comment,
                        much as the original report of the Committee of Nine was referred. On the
                        basis of the replies of governments, the twenty-second Economic and Social
                        Council and the eleventh General Assembly could give the matter further
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Scheyven</persName> report recommends that the
                        General Assembly determine the minimum contribution before <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> should be established. It would be
                        pointless for the United States to engage in debate on this subject since we
                        are unprepared to contribute and are convinced that whatever contributions
                        may be forthcoming from other governments would be insufficient to justify
                        establishing a top-heavy international apparatus. On this subject the United
                        States Delegation should not participate in any discussion.</p>
                    <p>The United States Delegation may wish to commend the authors of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SR1">Scheyven</persName> report for their constructive
                        efforts to clarify issues and reconcile divergent views. It would probably
                        be best to limit any remarks on the <persName corresp="#p_SR1"
                            >Scheyven</persName> report to simple courtesies.</p>

                        practicable”. It is apparent from the foregoing that the International
                        Bank’s activities fulfill this requirement, and that the United States
                        Government is likewise moving as fast as possible toward this objective.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 4 of the Assembly’s resolution requested the <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> “to report on this matter to the
                        General Assembly at its tenth session”. The United States interprets the
                        resolution as not requiring the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> to
                        comment upon the substance of the Articles of Agreement in its report to the
                        General Assembly. Although the Delegation should not endeavor to foreclose
                        all discussion of this nature in the Council, it should maintain the
                        position that the effect of the previous resolution was to request the
                        International Bank to proceed with steps leading to the establishment of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> and to report the subsequent
                        progress toward this objective. The present action of the Council should be
                        limited to reporting the steps taken, and the progress made, to the General
                        Assembly in response to paragraph 4 of the resolution.</p>
                    <p>It is assumed that the Bank’s representative will be prepared to handle
                        questions raised by members of the Council concerning the Articles of
                        Agreement, and the nature of the proposed Corporation, and the United States
                        Delegation should refrain insofar as possible from responding to such
                        questions. One question may arise, however, <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343"
                            facs="0373"/> on which the Delegation might feel called upon to make a
                        statement. Under the Articles of Agreement, only present and future members
                        of the International Bank and Monetary Fund are eligible for membership in
                        the new Corporation. Certain delegations (Argentina, USSR and Czechoslovakia
                        are not presently members of the Bank or Fund) may question this
                        requirement, and there is attached a brief statement of the United States
                        position on this matter for the possible use of the Delegation. This
                        material should be used only if the failure of the Delegation to speak on
                        this point would be conspicuous and embarrassing.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>George</persName></hi>: As you know, the
                        proposal for an International Development Fund has been under consideration
                        by the United Nations for several years. The Economic and Finance Committee
                        of the Tenth General Assembly<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">The 10th session
                            convened on September 20.</note> has had under consideration a proposal
                        to establish an Ad Hoc Committee to analyze comments of governments with
                        reference to the proposal, and the United States has been serving on an
                        informal sub-committee to draft acceptable language.</p>
                    <p>The enclosed draft resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">Not found with the

                        this <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0374"/>sub-committee and it is the

                            Delegation is printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                        does not contravene in any respect the position of the United States.
                        Consequently, since a decision had to be made immediately, I assumed
                        responsibility, upon the recommendation of Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_HB1">Brooks Hays</persName>, for acceptance of this
                        language, but only on condition that the record reflect, as it now does,
                        that Member States are not committed in any way and that no authority exists
                        in the resolution for the drawing of a statute to establish an international
                        fund.</p>
                    <p>For our Government to have withheld approval of this resolution, which merely
                        authorizes continued studies as above outlined, would have constituted a
                        retreat from the position outlined by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> in his speech<note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">The
                            President’s address before the American Society of Newspaper Editors was
                            broadcast to the nation over radio and television. For text, see <hi
                                rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> April 27, 1953, p. 599.</note> on April
                        16, 1953, in which he stated: “This Government is ready to ask its people to
                        join with all nations in devoting a substantial percentage of the savings
                        achieved by disarmament to a fund for world aid and reconstruction.” I hope
                        you will agree that it would have been unthinkable for our Government to
                        show any weakness in our adherence to this significant statement of the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>In view of the facts set forth above, I became convinced that the
                        Delegation’s judgment was correct. A reading of the enclosed statement by
                        Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HB1">Hays</persName>, our Representative
                        on the Economic Committee, clearly establishes the United States’
                        understanding in agreeing to this procedure for collating information on
                        various proposals pertaining to a fund for economic development of
                        underdeveloped countries.</p>
                    <p>I very much regret that the time element prevented full consultation with
                        you, which normally I would always do on any matter affecting the
                        Treasury.</p>
                    <p>The lack of time <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the damaging effect of our
                        failure to accept the language, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the fact that

                        in whom I have much confidence, made me feel justified in making this quick

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1"
                            >Wilcox</persName></hi>: Thank you for all the time you gave me when I
                        was recently in Washington. I appreciated having the opportunity of
                        discussing with you in detail the feelings I have had for sometime about the
                        “new look” which we must have in our international economic and social
                        programs. The longer I am in New York working with these problems, the more
                        I am convinced that new policies are needed not only for the Economic and
                        Social Council meetings in the spring and next summer but, above all, from
                        the point of view of our general position. Incidentally, there is a great
                        deal of support for a more constructive approach to our foreign economic aid
                        program here in the delegation to the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>You suggested that the way to start on this would be to prepare a list of
                        different proposals to be discussed. The following are certain suggestions
                        which I am sending along for what they are worth. They are, of course, a
                        consolidation of various ideas that I have received from many sources. I
                        hope we may be able to get together again in the near future to discuss
                        these and other ideas.</p>
                    <p>First, it seems to me that there are four propositions which should be
                        established concerning our general attitude: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>In the present period, we are entering a new era in the struggle
                                between East and West. We have two weapons: (a) ideas and ideals,
                                and (b) economic and technical help. Both must be used.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>We should develop constructive attitudes and policies which would
                                permit us to take aggressive leadership with new ideas in various
                                economic areas. The negative approach such as “Stop <gloss
                                    target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>” is today inadequate.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Such policies might well to a large extent be carried out within
                                existing or contemplated appropriations.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>There should be a greater concentration of our efforts on
                                significant projects in underdeveloped areas than we now have. This
                                could have a far greater impact on world impressions and attitudes
                                than the present proliferation of assistance.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The following is a list of positive suggestions looking to improvement of our
                        total effort which might merit discussion.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Numerous people whom I saw on my trip seemed to feel that we needed to
                            evaluate our past and present programs, both multilateral and bilateral.
                            Most of them felt that the emergency period had <pb n="346"
                                xml:id="pg_346" facs="0376"/>passed, and that we should organize
                            ourselves for the long haul. I believe that they would recommend that we
                            review our administrative proposals and programs, get suggestions from
                            our country directors in recipient countries as to how to proceed, and
                            invite their observations of any new proposals that might be made. For
                            example, some felt that funds should not be appropriated on a year by
                            year basis, but that we should appropriate funds which would be adequate
                            to finance projects which would continue over a period of years.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We should support a group of imposing key projects in various parts of
                            the world; projects so significant locally that they would clearly
                            demonstrate our great interest in that part of the world. Examples of
                            this might be the High Aswan Dam, the Mekong River and regional
                            technical institutes.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item><p>Since 1953 I have been impressed with the good will accruing to us
                                from our support of multilateral technical assistance through the
                                United Nations. Might it not be possible to shift to a greater
                                extent from our bilateral technical assistance aid to multilateral

                                should not be ignored. We have made our position clear, and I think

                            <p>At this time, however, we might consider the possibility of proposing

                                construction of basic projects in under-developed countries. Such a
                                program should, of course, include all the necessary safeguards,
                                including weighted voting. It might, for example, be within the

                                operation might be quite different from the proposed <gloss
                                    target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, it would be designed to
                                achieve the same objectives—to extend assistance for basic

                                special arrangement loans. A moderate program of this kind would get
                                us out of the position of opposition to greater multilateral action
                                for economic development at this time, while still <pb n="347"

                                demonstrate more effectively to the under-developed countries that
                                our assistance is based on genuine concern for their economic

                                still do too little about it. As I told you, I am tremendously
                                impressed by the possibility of even more attention being devoted to
                                this area. For example, Congress and the nation are accustomed to
                                thinking of tax write-offs when we want to increase our industrial
                                plant. This has been tried and has succeeded. Certain nations are
                                now recognizing the importance of taking a proper attitude toward
                                the flow of private capital, and in Colombia, for example,
                                encouraging laws have been passed. Egypt has also been trying to
                                promote conditions favorable to increased foreign investment. Last

                            <p>In this connection, there is a feeling among representatives of many
                                countries, such as Egypt, that we are not really interested in
                                having our capital go abroad, and for that reason they show little
                                interest in this subject when we mention it. This tends to move them
                                into domestic policies which we describe as “socialistic” or
                                unfriendly to us.</p>

                                    <item>Private capital now finds that the climate and the
                                        opportunity in this country promise substantial returns
                                        often greater than in other parts of the world. Therefore, I
                                        believe we should consider the possibility of urging even
                                        more substantial tax advantages to corporations which would
                                        invest abroad than already proposed by the Administration.
                                        The successful application of tax advantages is evidenced by
                                        the rebuilding of cities in Western Germany after the

                            <p>Certainly we should discuss the wisdom of offering real tax
                                advantages to a corporation investing money and know-how abroad.
                                These tax advantages might be two-fold: they should permit a
                                corporation to invest abroad a percentage of their annual earnings
                                on which no tax would be levied. Also, they might be given tax
                                advantages on bringing the earnings of these investments in foreign
                                countries back to this country. These advantages could, perhaps, be
                                worked out so as to offer inducements to those companies which would
                                invest in areas involving a relatively high risk.</p>

                            might create great good will. These people would not be advisers simply,
                            but would be individuals with so much know-how they could do the job
                            themselves and teach others to do it. These individuals might well be

                            foreign aid field could be greatly strengthened, if a more determined
                            effort were made to develop integrated country programs. As far as
                            possible, and particularly in the strategically important countries,
                            this should include everything from the provision of know-how to direct
                            financing, from aid in the development of basic services and facilities
                            to the promotion of private investment. To this end, the Administration
                            should take the lead in bringing together for purposes of common
                            planning and the development of coordinated action all the interested
                            elements within our own country. This does not only include the various
                            sectors of our own Government (Departments of Agriculture, Labor,
                            Commerce, Health, Education and <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0379"

                            industrial programs, including the building of factories; American
                            schools and colleges which would be responsible for the provision of
                            training facilities at home and abroad; private social and welfare
                            agencies responsible for welfare programs; and foundations ready to
                            undertake special projects which might fall within their area of
                            competence. Such a move on the part of the Administration to bring
                            together in a close cooperative relationship all the interested elements
                            would result in increased support for the entire foreign aid program on
                            the part of the American people, would render the individual programs
                            more effective, and would certainly strengthen our relations with the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>George</persName></hi>: Thank you for
                        your letter of December 5th concerning the question of an International
                        Development Fund.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">Not printed. (<hi

                    <p>I wholeheartedly share your desire for a mutual understanding of what our
                        policy is with regard to this matter. I think I am correct in stating that
                        there has been no real change in our policy—a policy outlined by the
                        President in his speech of April 16, 1953. Until the peoples of the world
                        have joined in a disarmament system which results in substantial savings in
                        the burdens of armaments, there will be no funds from this country or any of
                        the other countries from whom funds would have to come that can go into such
                        a large world project for aid and reconstruction as has been contemplated by
                        the under-developed countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">This section
                            reflects the position <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>
                            took in his December 5 letter.</note></p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the position we were in during the debate on <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> was potentially dangerous to the
                        United States in the international arena because of the possibility that a
                        resolution would have been voted which would have been most repugnant to us.
                        I believe that, as a result of the statements made this year by Congressman
                            <persName corresp="#p_HB1">Hays</persName> in the Second Committee
                        dealing with economic and financial matters, we have not only thwarted that
                        potential danger but turned the situation into one where the United States
                        position is clear in substance and, at the same time, our posture appears to
                        be much more consistent with our genuine concern for the well-being of
                        peoples throughout the world. We also obtained a resolution which enables us
                        to exert a constructive influence on the future.</p>
                    <p>In this forum we have to take account of the prevailing sentiment, no matter
                        how much we disagree with it, and guide it in the correct direction. When
                        you favor a thing conditionally, it seems to me it is always better to say
                        so and to assert those conditions strongly, rather than to say you are
                        against it unless such and such happens. This is the only new element in the
                        situation and represents no change at all in our fundamental policy or the
                        understanding of it throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>While I agree that any possibility of a substantial contribution to an
                        International Development Fund is in the very dim future, it <pb n="351"
                            xml:id="pg_351" facs="0381"/>seems proper to spend a certain amount of
                        time in discussing it. We must keep our position on the record as clear as
                        possible so that it will appear in the best possible light before the rest
                        of the world and particularly in the eyes of the countries who want an
                        International Development Fund to assist in the establishment of relatively
                        healthy economies in these newly independent areas.</p>
                    <p>That is just the price one pays for belonging to an international
                        organization such as the United Nations.<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">In a
                            letter of December 19, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2"
                                >Humphrey</persName> replied in part as follows: “I think we both
                            fully agree on the situation. However, we just don’t want to be so
                            diplomatic and agreeable in handling it that we actually become involved
                            in commitments for expenditures before the time really comes that we can
                            greatly reduce military expenditures and thus make some part of our
                            saving available for this purpose.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                                approximately $36.7 billion at the end of 1954. Of this total, $23.8
                                billion or 65 percent was private investment, of which $17.7 billion
                                was direct investment. Approximately $12 billion, or one-third of
                                the total investment was in the less-developed areas. Two out of

                                decisions, and cannot be “programmed” by government policy or
                                action. Increasing familiarity with private enterprise may tend to

                                established economic and other relationships of the United States.
                                In much of the Far East, Near East and Africa, particularly,
                                commercial relations have, in the past, been relatively limited and
                                largely carried on through the agency of British, Dutch and other
                                European concerns. Accordingly, United States investment relations
                                have been relatively slow to develop.</item>

                            been developed over a number of years, and the recommendations which
                            follow suggest improvements instead of innovations. The problem is one
                            which cannot be solved in a year or two.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the circumstances with which United States policy must cope
                            vary materially from country to country and from time to time. The
                            agencies having responsibility in this field must continuously review
                            the situation obtaining in each country in the light of overall
                            objectives of United States policy in that country, so as to determine
                            the applicability of general investment policies and programs to the
                            circumstances then obtaining in each such country.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">1. Investment Treaties</hi></p>
                        <p>The program of negotiating treaties of Friendship, Commerce and
                            Navigation should be vigorously pursued, with particular reference to
                            the less developed areas. The negotiating process provides a very useful
                            forum for considering a variety of subjects related to the stimulation
                            of private investment in general.</p>
                        <p>To be of value for the particular objectives of the investment program
                            such treaties must provide as a minimum for assurance of national
                            treatment for U.S. enterprises located in the other country and for
                            prompt, just and effective compensation in the event of expropriation.
                            Beyond this minimum such treaties will contribute more to the investment
                            program in those cases where it proves possible to obtain assurance of
                            unrestricted entry for U.S. enterprises or a wide area of unrestricted
                            entry into the other country than in those cases where it is not
                            possible to obtain provisions containing such assurance.</p>
                        <p>These treaties must of course be based upon principles of mutuality. For
                            this reason provision for unrestricted entry must naturally be limited
                            to the fields in which aliens are left free to invest by the
                            restrictions imposed by federal and state law in the United States.</p>

                            Reconstruction and Development in placing emphasis on obtaining a

                            their lending operations should be welcomed and encouraged. The
                            Export-Import Bank should continue, when appropriate, to stimulate
                            private equity investment through the extension of accompanying loans,
                            particularly when American firms otherwise prepared to make a
                            substantial investment in foreign operations are unable to do so without
                            an accompanying Export-Import Bank loan. The Eximbank should also
                            continue, when appropriate, to support through loans foreign investment

                            promote private investment. When the International Finance Corporation
                            is established (presumably early in 1956) the United States
                            representatives should exert their influence to make sure that it
                            fulfills its objectives of encouraging the growth of productive private
                            enterprise to the maximum extent possible, whenever financing is not

                            In administering this program the major emphasis should be upon direct

                            acceptable conditions for foreign investment. In many instances,
                            influential local leaders have no practical economic experience yet they
                            have to make decisions of tremendous economic import. In this kind of
                            situation our missions can be of great help in steering foreign
                            governments toward sound economic policies.</p>
                        <p>At present U.S. missions and consular establishments—particularly in the
                            less developed countries—are ill equipped to perform <pb n="358"
                                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0388"/>such functions adequately. Many of the
                            personnel have no specialized investment training, they are burdened
                            with heavy reporting schedules and cannot devote sufficient time to the
                            local factors adversely affecting U.S. private investment; they are
                            often shifted to fill gaps in political and consular work. This is
                            particularly true of the less developed areas where personnel shortages
                            and emphasis on political reporting forces the missions to neglect
                            economic and investment reporting. In many instances, the lack of local
                            personnel to help American officers better understand local conditions
                            is the rule rather than the exception. All too often officers are
                            transferred just as they acquire competence in gauging local situations
                            and have established effective contacts.</p>
                        <p>Where appropriate, consideration should be given to stationing abroad
                            special officers with business, financial or investment experience to
                            work unobtrusively on the problem of establishing a better understanding
                            of the conditions and institutions which will promote higher rates of
                            investment of domestic and foreign capital, that is, to seek to improve
                            the investment climate. Such officers should serve as members of the
                            country team under the supervision of the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>It should be understood that any improvements in Foreign Service
                            operations in the respects mentioned above must be accomplished in terms
                            of the total resources of the Department of State, and the total
                            obligation of that Department for all aspects of our foreign
                            relations.</p>

                        Economic Development (<gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>); (2) the

                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>); (6) economic assistance to Libya,
                        and (7) the report of the Agent General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Korean Reconstruction Agency (<gloss target="#t_UNKRA1"
                            >UNKRA</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>The dominant theme in the Economic Committee continued to be the problem of
                        the economic development of underdeveloped countries. Ninety percent of the
                        discussion dealt with one or another aspect of this problem, and the
                        underdeveloped countries continued to press for establishment of a new
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> development fund to finance investment
                        in basic facilities, so-called “infrastructure” projects.</p>
                    <p>The question of economic self-determination, which was considered in the
                        Social Committee, was the most controversial and occupied most of that
                        Committee’s time. On this question, although the language used in setting
                        out the right of economic self-determination was improved in the course of
                        debate, the US was unable to make its views prevail and the delegation found
                        it necessary to vote against the majority position. Of the other items,
                        technical assistance and the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> involved no
                        difficult questions at this session. As to the proposal for <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, no attempt was made to take any
                        decisive step at this time toward establishment of the fund or drafting its
                        statutes, as was the case last year. While keeping up the pressure in
                        general debate, the tendency so far as action by the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                            >GA</gloss> was concerned was to concentrate on the more modest task to
                        be performed by the Ad Hoc Committee set up under the resolution on this
                        item. The US was able to accept this resolution in its final form.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet bloc countries continued to exhibit apparent reasonableness in
                        their analysis of international economic problems and at the same time
                        strongly emphasized their concern for the problems of <pb n="360"
                            xml:id="pg_360" facs="0390"/>the underdeveloped countries and stressed
                        that they were prepared to assist the underdeveloped countries, particularly
                        in their efforts at industrialization.</p>
                    <p>At this session, attention tended to focus more on efforts to expand
                        multilateral programs to assist the underdeveloped countries through the

                        at its summer session, calling for the establishment of an Ad Hoc
                        Committee—presumably of government representatives—to carry on the work of
                        the proposed special fund. The position of member governments on the
                        establishment of a fund had not changed materially from what it was the
                        previous year. The underdeveloped countries all strongly favored it. The
                        Netherlands continued to support its immediate establishment and was
                        prepared to contribute to that end; a number of countries, such as the
                        Scandinavians and Belgium, were prepared to support establishment of a fund
                        before disarmament provided the US and other large contributors came in; and
                        the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, Canada and New Zealand
                        continued to insist on prior internationally supervised world-wide
                        disarmament before supporting establishment of a fund. The Soviet bloc
                        expressed support in principle and indicated readiness to consider
                        participation in an international development fund, while at the same time
                        recognizing that disarmament must provide the greatest source of resources
                        for it.</p>
                    <p>The US delegate, while maintaining our position of disarmament first and the
                        special fund later, did emphasize our concern for the problems of the
                        underdeveloped areas, our determination to continue to assist them in other
                        feasible ways and our conviction that postponement of the establishment of a
                            <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> was not tantamount to
                        postponement of economic development.</p>
                    <p>A draft resolution of 32 countries, taking its cue from the <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> resolution, proposed that governments
                        be invited to comment on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SR1"
                        >Scheyven</persName>’s latest report and that these comments be analyzed by
                        an Ad Hoc Committee of government representatives. For various reasons, this
                        draft resolution was unacceptable to the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>. It was thereupon referred to a small informal working party
                            <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0391"/>on which the US participated.
                        After considerable discussion, agreement was reached on a revised draft of
                        the resolution and particularly in a precise statement of the task of the Ad
                        Hoc Committee. The task of the Committee is now to prepare: (a) a summary of
                        the views submitted by Governments on the establishment, role, structure and
                        operations of a <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>; (b) an analysis
                        of those views, that is, their presentation in such a form as to facilitate
                        the understanding of them by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> and
                        the Assembly; and (c) such conclusions as clearly emerge from the above
                        analysis.</p>
                    <p>Since it was made clear that the Committee is not empowered to draft the
                        articles of agreement of a <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> or
                        otherwise to bring a <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> into

                        in the Social Committee dealt with draft article I on self-determination to
                        be included in two Draft Covenants on Human Rights. Paragraph 3 of article I
                        stated that the right of peoples to self-determination shall also include
                        “permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources” and that in
                        no case might a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence on the
                        grounds of any rights that might be claimed by other states. The US
                        delegation opposed the paragraph in the belief that it might tend to
                        undermine the confidence of the private investors in the security of his
                        investments in underdeveloped areas and thus discourage the flow of capital
                        to those areas. Although the phrase “permanent sovereignty over their
                        natural wealth and resources” was removed from the draft by the working
                        party established by the Social Committee, the US was obliged to vote
                        against the revised text, as it did not make sufficiently clear that the
                        paragraph was not intended to impair legal rights of individuals or
                        authorize expropriation without adequate, prompt and effective compensation.
                        The US did, however, vote in favor of the postponement of the question of
                        self-determination under a subsequent article until the eleventh General
                        Assembly.</p>

                        Assistance Pledging Conference, held during the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>During the debate in the Economic Committee and at the pledging conference,
                        the US was able to reaffirm its support of the program, and to announce a
                        pledge of $15,500,000 for the calendar year 1956, subject only to the
                        limitation that the US contribution not exceed 50% of the total
                        contributions from all governments. This was a larger amount than we have
                        pledged heretofore for any one year. A number of other countries also
                        announced increased contributions during the discussion of the item. The
                        Soviet bloc continued its support of the program, although the USSR, Poland
                        and Czechoslovakia argued that too small a proportion of the funds available
                        was being devoted to technical assistance for industrial development and
                        complained that their contributions were not being utilized as quickly as
                        they should be.</p>
                    <p>The pledging conference brought in pledges of approximately $30 million, to
                        set a new record high for financial support of the program. Twenty-six
                        pledges represented increases over 1955, with no country pledging less for
                        1956 than for the preceding year.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">International Finance Corporation</hi> The General Assembly
                        in its action on this item last year left it to the International Bank to
                        draft the Charter of the Corporation and to obtain agreement on it among its
                        members. When the Assembly took up this matter again at this session, 20
                        governments, including the US, had already signed the Charter prepared by
                        the Bank and 29 others had indicated that they were in favor of membership
                        in the Corporation. Extensive debate on the <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss> Charter was avoided although a small number of countries
                        complained that the Bank had flouted the prerogatives of the Assembly by
                        failing to provide an opportunity for such discussion.</p>
                    <p>The US delegation emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>
                        would not provide the answer to all the problems facing the private investor

                        private capital would have to continue to work to encourage it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Report of the Economic and Social Council</hi> Discussion
                        of the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> report centered around
                        problems of international trade, particularly east-west trade and the
                        question of machinery for international cooperation in the field of trade.
                        During the east-west trade debate, the Western countries analyzed the
                        situation in some detail, the reasons for the relatively low level of
                        east-west trade and the manner in which this problem was dealt with at the
                        Geneva Foreign Ministers meeting. The Soviet bloc replied with the usual
                        argument about the relationship between strategic controls and the
                        confidence necessary to expanding trade and attempted to cast the blame for
                        the Geneva failure in this field on the Western powers.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet bloc also devoted considerable time to the question of appropriate
                        machinery for international trade cooperation. They argued that the General
                        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) and
                        Organization for Trade Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_OTC1">OTC</gloss>)
                        were too restrictive to provide a truly global framework for such
                        cooperation, that this matter should be looked into by the <gloss

                        Assembly consideration next year.</p>
                    <p>During the discussion, the representative of Afghanistan strongly attacked
                        Pakistan for blockading his country and a lengthy exchange on this matter
                        developed between the two countries.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Other Matters</hi> The Assembly also debated the question
                        of economic assistance to Libya, in which the Arab states took a leading
                        role. A resolution, similar to an earlier one, which elicited no favorable
                        response, was passed requesting the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Secretary General to inquire about the willingness of the member states to

                    <p>In explaining its acceptance of the resolution, the US delegation reviewed
                        the assistance being made directly available by us to Libya and stated that
                        we intended to continue to use these channels to assist Libya as against

                        With reference to our conversation this morning about <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, the President in his speech of April
                        16, 1953 stated that when the people of the world had joined in a
                        disarmament system which resulted in substantial savings in the burdens of
                        armaments, we would be glad to use some of our savings toward increasing
                        peaceful pursuits throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>The subject was up for discussion in the United Nations last fall when
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot Lodge</persName> handled it on this
                        basis. He wrote me under date of December 13, 1955<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d139fn2"><ref target="#d136">Document 136</ref>.</note> that he
                        understood our policy to be that there would be no funds available for
                            <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> for such purposes until the
                        conditions laid down by the President had been complied with. I wrote him as
                        per copy enclosed on December 19th,<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">See <ref

                        independently of achievement of internationally controlled disarmament on

                    <p>I think it would be a great mistake for us to do this. We are far better off
                        to handle our own economic assistance throughout the world in the way that
                        will best serve our interests, and preserve whatever credit there is in it
                        for ourselves, rather than to turn the use of our money over to <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> management, which I believe is not as
                        competent as our own.</p>
                    <p>This is a matter of important policy to be determined. <persName

                            According Yugoslav Mission, “other commitments” would in any event

                                <item>We should, as a minimum, reject any policy whereby the United
                                    States would appear to be opposing multilateral aid. Such policy
                                    would hand the Soviet Union a propaganda advantage, the value of
                                    which could only be measured in millions of dollars. It would
                                    certainly be bad business to hand them this advantage unless we
                                    get a greater advantage in return. Those who say that opposition
                                    by the Soviet Union to multilateral aid gives US a chance to
                                    oppose multilateral aid also are looking through the wrong end
                                    of the telescope and are missing a wonderful opportunity.</item>

                                <item>The Soviets prefer bilateral aid because it means that they
                                    can use that aid for their own political purposes. The US,

                                    It should be stipulated that contributions must be completely

                            >Wilcox</persName></hi>: You will recall that in my letter of December
                        7, 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2"><ref target="#d135">Document
                            135</ref>.</note> I made certain suggestions concerning new economic
                        policies for the Economic and Social Council and also from the point of view
                        of our general position. As a result of this there was a <pb n="367"
                            xml:id="pg_367" facs="0397"/>memorandum prepared in the Department
                        setting out certain specific affirmative measures which the United States
                        might take in the United Nations and related agencies. This formed the basis
                        of the very valuable discussions we had in Washington on January 17. I have
                        now had occasion to give the matter further thought in the light of these
                        discussions and believe that we should concentrate on a few specific points
                        for a short-term program, while at the same time continuing with a long-term
                        program along the lines of some of the suggestions contained in my letter of
                        December as well as in the Departmental memorandum.</p>
                    <p>We are now all agreed, I believe, on the premise that the principal
                        preoccupation of the under-developed countries is their rapid economic
                        development, and that for this the two things needed are “<hi rend="italic"
                            >know how</hi>” and <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> I, therefore, would
                        like to suggest for serious consideration in the Department the following
                        short-term program that might be accomplished through the Economic and
                        Social Council.</p>

                                    >SUNFED</gloss> as recently recommended by Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>, there is still the
                                possibility of establishing a capital fund for technical assistance
                                projects, not only for demonstration purposes, but also as a means
                                of implementing recommendations of experts relating to technical
                                improvement and economic development. A pilot plant “<gloss
                                    target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>” could be started with a $60
                                million fund for grants-in-aid related to technical assistance
                                projects. This idea has already been advanced by the Secretariat,
                                and I understand has been passed on to the Department informally.
                                Some of the advantages such an agreement might have are outlined in
                                the attached annex. I understand that the Secretariat’s thinking in
                                connection with a combination Technical Assistance Capital Fund has
                                gone so far that they are now considering presenting it to <gloss
                                    target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> next summer. The French, as you
                                know, may suggest an expansion of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> Technical Assistance Program, and have expressed the

                                established as a going operation. With this new development and with
                                what the Secretariat is considering, it would seem only timely that
                                we give immediate consideration to something of this nature.</p>

                            think it would be well to consider the possibility of disposing of

                                >UN</gloss>. The necessity of disposing of US surplus agricultural
                            commodities without affecting world markets is a difficult problem with
                            which we are all familiar. Such products might well be utilized for
                            economic development through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and
                            would relieve the United States of the responsibility of the method of
                            disposal while at the same time acquiring for us substantial good will.
                            Of course, any other country could contribute commodities for disposal
                            through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</item>

                    <p>Perhaps it should be pointed out at the outset that the statement in the copy
                        of your letter to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName> “that
                        we had a firm policy of spending our own money by ourselves” is not strictly
                        accurate. We have been engaged for about five years now in United Nations
                        Technical Assistance, which is a multilateral program (and which,
                        incidentally, up to now has been run pretty much as we wanted it run). There
                        is also the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">I.F.C.</gloss>, in which you played such
                        a decisive part—not to mention the Specialized Agencies.</p>
                    <p>My basic contention is that the United States (preferably through the
                        President at a great public occasion) should challenge the Soviet Union to
                        match our contributions to an international fund for economic aid to
                        underdeveloped countries. This offer should be limited in amount. The ratio
                        of payments should be similar to that now contributed for support of the
                        United Nations, which means that we would contribute the largest individual
                        percentage—331/3 percent—thereby insuring our control of the program.
                        Contributions to the fund should be largely in convertible currency. That
                        percentage which is not in convertible currency we can use for expending our
                        own surpluses.</p>
                    <p>For the President to make this offer would have an even greater impact than
                        the “Atoms for Peace”<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">In an address before the

                            on July 21, 1955, at the Heads of Government meeting at Geneva, July
                            18–23, which proposed that both the United States and the Soviet Union
                            be allowed to take aerial photographs of each other’s countries, see <hi
                                rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> August 1, 1955, p. 174.</note> proposals,
                        far-reaching as these were, because, like these two programs, they take the
                        initiative and <hi rend="italic">they challenge</hi>.</p>
                    <p>If we do not gain and hold the initiative in the field of economic aid, our
                        position in the Middle East will be jeopardized because it will appear in
                        those countries that the Soviets have us on the run and that our present
                        programs are a rear-guard action. This would, of course, endanger our stake
                        in the Middle East, with all that that implies, as regards petroleum, etc.
                            <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0401"/>There is reason to believe that
                        to engage in a limited and carefully controlled multilateral program would
                        actually be cheaper in dollars than to succumb to the type of blackmail
                        which is now in prospect. In the base agreement for Wheelus Field in Libya,
                        for example, there is no understanding prohibiting Soviet penetration of the
                        area. You, yourself, have said many times in my presence, that you would
                        never begrudge funds for vital national defense. If the integrity of this
                        base were compromised as a result of these blackmail tactics, we would have
                        to put up money to preserve our base and the amount would probably be far
                        larger than would be required by generally taking the initiative through
                        challenging the Soviets to enter a multilateral program.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt that we could control such a program and that capable
                        Americans could be placed at the top of its administration—unless we delay
                        so long that we lose the initiative and an unattractive program is forced on
                        us. I have assurance from Hammarskjold to this effect.</p>
                    <p>The program would be carried out by personnel who would be uniformed and
                        labeled. The whole operation would have great publicity, which would protect
                        the recipient nations from being subverted.</p>
                    <p>It could not possibly open any door to the Soviet Union which is not now open
                        to it, but would instead mean that Soviet activity could be under some sort
                        of supervision. It is the only method I can think of to avoid a US-USSR
                        auction.</p>
                    <p>Every country which today tries to siphon money out of the U.S. Treasury
                        could be very plainly told that all it had to do was to get the Soviet Union
                        to put up its amount and that the United States would then come through.
                        This would “put the monkey on their back” and give us the initiative.</p>
                    <p>Such a program would, of course, be used to help us get some of the things
                        that we want abroad—such as security for our bases.</p>
                    <p>Much of the money would be spent in the United States to buy products of
                        American industry and it would provide an outlet for our agricultural
                        surpluses.</p>
                    <p>It should be done under the aegis of the United Nations in order to avoid
                        having it look like a mere cold war debating tactic.</p>
                    <p>The main underlying purpose should be to build up those backward countries
                        economically. That is why I think that you should be put in charge of it,
                        because not only have you got extraordinary ability, but you understand what
                        it is that makes for economic health.</p>
                    <p>We should act soon because probably the Soviets will think of making some
                        offer like this themselves and then we would be put in the position of
                        running along behind the bus picking up the pieces.</p>
                    <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0402"/>
                    <p>The friends of America and opponents of communism in those backward countries
                        all speak of the need for a coordinated American policy which will give us
                        the initiative. This proposal seeks to meet that need.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are constantly pulling ahead and if they should win the contest
                        the expense to us would make this scheme seem trifling.</p>
                    <p>Reading over the copy of your letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> makes it appear that you and I are very far apart on
                        this question. Yet I do not really think so. I have found myself too often
                        in agreement with you not to feel that we want essentially the same thing
                        and I know how receptive your mind is to new ideas. My very close contact
                        with world opinion here in the world forum convinces me that we cannot get
                        away with a purely negative answer and that such an answer would hand over
                        to the Soviet Union a propaganda advantage which would be worth many
                        millions of dollars to them. A negative answer would also take them off a
                        very embarrassing “spot” because there is good reason to believe that they
                        fear any program which is either multilateral or which stipulates
                        convertible currency.</p>
                    <p>I intend to attend the Cabinet meeting on Friday and would be glad to discuss
                        this with you after the meeting if this is convenient to you.</p>
                    <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>In line with our conversation in the hall yesterday morning I am sending
                        along a brief memorandum outlining the case for [and] <pb n="373"
                            xml:id="pg_373" facs="0403"/>against <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>. I should add that most people who have studied the
                        problem do not necessarily subscribe to the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> proposal as it has been put forth in New York. Indeed I
                        think it is more appropriate to talk in terms of a multilateral assistance
                        program without specific reference to <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> inasmuch as that term has fallen into disrepute in some
                        quarters.</p>
                    <p>If we should decide to offer to participate in a multilateral assistance
                        program, I believe we should do it in the context of a broader program which
                        might envisage various steps by the recipient countries to encourage
                        productivity within their borders. For example, they might well agree to
                        create a more favorable climate for private capital which is so essential if
                        any economic development program is to succeed.</p>
                    <p>You may have noticed that Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_HB1"
                            >Hays</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Merrow</persName> in
                        their report to Congress on the Tenth General Assembly commented very
                        favorably on multilateral aid programs. They state: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It is our conviction that the delegation’s statement should have
                                included emphasis of the need for utilizing multilateral programs to
                                an increasing degree. It is urgently necessary that in the future we
                                make far greater use of the United Nations system for foreign aid
                                than we have in the past. This would not mean an increased amount of
                                money appropriated for foreign aid but rather the channeling of a
                                part of existing appropriations through United Nations
                                machinery.”</p>

                            <item>It is entirely possible that the Russians may decide to give
                                vigorous support to the early establishment of <gloss

                                although they entered some minor caveats about grant aid. While the

                                could make extraordinary capital at our expense by adopting an

                                We have no guarantee that they will not do so. The cost in resources
                                would not be too great and the propaganda yield could be
                                enormous.</item>

                            <item>Our public position in the United Nations on this issue is tenable
                                but it does us no credit. It is not especially convincing even to
                                ourselves. We maintain that the resources that <gloss
                                    target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> could command at this time
                                would not justify establishing a complex international machinery.
                                Yet the United Nations Technical Assistance Program, the Children’s
                                Fund, the International Committee for European Migration and many
                                other multilateral programs make a contribution of some
                                effectiveness with smaller resources than <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                                    >SUNFED</gloss> could certainly command if the United States
                                gave it support. Each year we are confronted with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> issue at the <gloss

                                From time to time we are confronted with it at <gloss

                                falls with a dull thud. It is difficult to determine how this
                                affects our relations in the United Nations. Our delegations to
                                these <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> bodies have generally felt
                                that our negative posture was a divisive force in the <gloss

                                Short of substantial savings from disarmament, it is most unlikely
                                that other contributions would be so great that our 1/3 share would
                                rise above $100 million. It is more likely that our contributions,
                                if provided on a matching basis, would fall below $85

                                    reputation— who would report periodically to the members but who
                                    would have full authority to make decisions during his tenure in
                                    office. This would take the administration of the Fund out from
                                    under political control, but we as well as the less developed
                                    countries should then have given up our voice in formulating
                                    policy. Alternatively we could protect ourselves by requiring
                                    that no allocation of a member’s contribution be made without
                                    the member’s consent in each case. This would not increase the
                                    efficiency of the Fund nor would it ensure any pooling at all;

                            <item>We might have a hard time persuading the Congress to permit the
                                use of aid money through <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>,
                                in part because the Congress prefers bilateral aid and in part
                                because the Soviet satellites might be potential recipients of aid.
                                (To date the Soviet Bloc members have not requested technical
                                assistance through the <gloss target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss>; they
                                might be equally reluctant to ask for capital aid if this involved
                                    <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> missions, examination
                                by an international staff of development programs, fiscal policy
                                etc.) If the Congress were persuaded, however, they might require
                                that any contribution to <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>

                                of Title II funds, the Asian Fund or the proposed Middle East Fund.
                                Before requesting funds, we should have to weigh in the balance the
                                loss of our foreign policy objectives that would result from the
                                possible diminution or extinction of these bilateral programs
                                against the gain to be derived from supporting a global development
                                fund. The balance would probably be struck in favor of continuing
                                bilateral programs and the regional funds.</item>

                            398.051/3–556)</note> I certainly agree that we must manage our foreign
                        economic aid in such ways as will best serve our national interests. No
                        element of foreign policy could possibly be built on any other premise.</p>
                    <p>At the present time it is vitally important that the impulse towards economic
                        development in many lands should neither be channelled in directions
                        prejudicial to our security nor frustrated so as to make the aspiring
                        peoples easy prey to the illusory promises of those hostile to us. Our
                        capabilities of furthering our objectives along this line by sheer argument
                        or diplomatic intervention are limited. For this reason, among others, we
                        have resorted to economic programs of both a bilateral and multilateral
                        nature. We have achieved some measure of success and have obtained much
                        credit and goodwill from both types of programs.</p>
                    <p>The increasing impatience of many Afro-Asian peoples to achieve rapid
                        economic development and their corresponding receptivity to the new Soviet
                        tactics have made it all the more urgent that we seek the instruments or
                        methods most likely, on the one hand, to build internal political and
                        economic institutions oriented toward the free world and, on the other, to
                        imbue in these countries the desire and the will to resist Communist
                        subversion.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the present Soviet economic offensive requires a general
                        reexamination of our aid programs to determine whether <pb n="378"
                            xml:id="pg_378" facs="0408"/>they are as effective as they might be. As
                        part of this reexamination, we should consider the question of whether any
                        economic aid should be provided through a development institution within the
                        framework of the United Nations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> believes we should announce our willingness to
                        participate in a multilateral aid program and presents a number of arguments
                        which he feels we should consider.</p>
                    <p>I mention these matters not because I believe we should at this time accept
                        any particular plan, but because I feel we need a careful review of all the
                        factors involved. A study of this matter is, therefore, being undertaken in
                        the Department with a view to presenting the findings to the Council on
                        Foreign Economic Policy for its consideration.</p>

                        US willingness to support creation of such fund. Proposal would involve no
                        extra funds by US beyond those already appropriated for economic aid abroad,
                        but would mean ear-marking 6 to 8 percent of annual appropriation for
                        economic aid. At no extra cost, therefore, we would stand to gain much. I
                        have assurances from Secretary-General that a US citizen would be appointed
                        to administer program. Delay is dangerous because of possibility of Russians
                        beating US to it and making similar offer first. US support of such a
                        multilateral fund <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0409"/>would, if

                        appear as genuine initiative and not last-ditch rearguard action. We must

                    <p>The seeds of international communism fall on fertile ground when impoverished
                        peoples see no hope. A hungry man, therefore, is more interested in four
                        sandwiches than he is in four freedoms. But people who are healthy and have
                        enough to eat will be strong enough to fight for themselves against
                        aggression from without or within. This is one important reason why the
                        United States supports programs for economic aid abroad.</p>
                    <p>A program to which many nations contribute under the auspices of the United
                        Nations has some real advantages over a program sponsored by the United
                        States alone. That is the difference between so-called “multilateral” aid
                        and “bilateral” aid.</p>
                    <p>Multilateral aid offers a way to prevent the so-called “auction” which some
                        are trying to promote between the United States and the USSR as to which
                        will spend the most in an underdeveloped country.</p>
                    <p>A multilateral program supplies no cover for engaging in political
                        penetration, which is what the communists do and which we are unjustly
                        suspected of wanting to do. We thus get credit for unselfish motives in
                        contributing to such a fund; yet we can influence it constructively.</p>
                    <p>The percentage which a country like ours contributes to a multilateral
                        program is less than it would be under a bilateral program because more
                        countries are sharing the expenses.</p>
                    <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0410"/>
                    <p>A multilateral program conducted in full public view by representatives of
                        the United Nations will not be misunderstood by those who benefit from it.
                        United Nations technicians in special uniforms, for example, would find it
                        difficult to engage in surreptitious political activity.</p>
                    <p>We need both bilateral and multilateral programs. But the present world
                        situation is one which requires our giving new emphasis to multilateral
                        programs. We can do this without any additional expense by diverting a
                        percentage of our foreign aid funds to multilateral channels.</p>

                        have in mind in considering the relative advantages and disadvantages of new
                        proposals for multilateral aid.</p>
                    <p>There are two main fields for aid. One is to advance our military objectives
                        with direct or indirect support required to finance or maintain military
                        strength of the recipients. The other is designed to promote the economic
                        strength and freedom of friendly countries by helping them to help
                        themselves and so increase their independence of action and avoid reliance
                        upon Russia.</p>
                    <p>Military aid, of course, must be worked out between ourselves and the
                        recipients on a bilateral basis or with the help of some trusted military
                        ally of ours if occasion requires and, for limited aspects, through <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In discussing multilateral aid we are, therefore, concerned principally with
                        economic aid. This, however, is so closely related to military aid that in
                        most cases they are inseparable. In the remaining cases which clearly permit
                        separate consideration, we already have instruments to handle them
                        satisfactorily, either multilaterally or bilaterally as our own best
                        interests may dictate.</p>
                    <p>There already exists in the World Bank a large, well-financed and active
                        instrument of multilateral lending either to governments or, upon government
                        guaranties, to private enterprise. It has excellent <pb n="381"
                            xml:id="pg_381" facs="0411"/>management and good organization, and wide
                        contacts with fifty-eight countries. It has been in existence for several
                        years and has a thorough knowledge of world conditions. (Soviet and iron
                        curtain countries are not members by their own choice.)</p>
                    <p>Theoretically, the World Bank’s funds were multilaterally supplied by the
                        participating countries, with our share being approximately 30 percent;
                        actually, we have put up approximately 80 percent of the capital and 60
                        percent of their bonds have been purchased by Americans. The others mostly
                        have put up small amounts of their own inconvertible currencies, or tickets
                        of good intent. If any other countries are anxious to engage in multilateral
                        loans, it would be much more appropriate for them, instead of starting a new
                        institution, to first pay up what they already owe in the one we now have
                        and open their markets more freely for its bond issues.</p>
                    <p>The World Bank has the great advantage of proven and experienced management
                        and it can be enlarged to any amount that the participating countries are
                        willing to put up. It has authorized lending power of about $9 billion under
                        its statutes.</p>
                    <p>The World Bank is supplemented by the new International Finance Corporation
                        which we started nearly two years ago but which is still inactive awaiting
                        the promised participation and contribution of various countries. It is
                        expected to begin operations sometime this summer, and then the activities
                        of the World Bank will be so supplemented that venture loans can be made
                        without government guaranties. In this way, the entire field of development
                        lending, clear through to venture capital investment, will be fully
                        covered.</p>
                    <p>We have also contributed $2¾ billion to the International Monetary Fund which
                        is helpful to its 58 member countries in providing needed temporary
                        financial assistance to give them time to correct their short term balance
                        of payments difficulties.</p>
                    <p>We are also already contributing substantially to the U.N. budget and
                        technical assistance activities, in the amount of about $100 million a
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Despite these very substantial provisions for multilateral lending, there are
                        several current suggestions for new organizations:</p>
                    <p>Cabot Lodge is urging that we support <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> primarily as a direct maneuver to put Russia in the
                        hole. He suggests that we start in a very small way, but experience has
                        shown us that such a scheme once started never ends and continually
                        grows—with the great bulk of the money always coming from us.</p>
                    <p>There are proposals for an Asian Corporation, in which a number of countries
                        interested in that area would start a new lending organization there.</p>
                    <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0412"/>
                    <p>Then, there is always the recurring request for a bank or a finance company
                        for South America.</p>
                    <p>These all follow the same pattern. We put up the great bulk of the
                        convertible dollars. They put in their own inconvertible currencies or
                        promises to pay at some future time. We supply the money. They supply the
                        majority of the board of directors to dispense it.</p>
                    <p>If we engage in any one, we will be set upon immediately for the others, and
                        unless we join with them, we will make more enemies than friends.</p>
                    <p>If new organizations are established to make loans on a looser basis than the
                        International Bank or Fund, it will clearly undermine their work.</p>
                    <p>Much of the success of the banks’ operations lies in the aid they have given
                        member countries in working out sound economic programs. Without such
                        programs, funds lent by looser methods might be largely wasted.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing any of these proposed schemes can do which cannot be done
                        better by a combination of the World Bank, the Monetary Fund, and the
                        International Finance Corporation, as multilateral agencies, supplemented by
                        our own Export-Import Bank, the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, and
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 agricultural sales and
                        loans.</p>
                    <p>Through the combination of the Export-Import Bank, the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss>
                        480, we are in position to make bilateral arrangements to cover every
                        reasonable need for loans, “soft” loans, and gifts. The only thing missing
                        is authority to make commitments of funds to be appropriated in future
                        years.</p>
                    <p>It is to cover this lack of authority to make long-term commitments out of
                        future appropriations that you have asked for the extra legislation that is
                        now pending in this Congress.</p>
                    <p>I think it is a very wholesome thing that such funds must be obtained from
                        the Congress as a part of the budget so that they are under constant review
                        and subject to the limitations of continuing legislation and criticism by
                        the public. Otherwise, the pressures on the Executive are so great that it
                        would be extremely difficult to resist unjustified expenditures.</p>
                    <p>I have a growing conviction that we will better promote our own global
                        purpose; that we will more nearly comply with the growing public demand for
                        tightening up aid activities; and that we will better serve the interests of
                        those peoples whom we are trying to assist by gradually, but firmly,
                        shifting our financial relations with them to sound, constructive,
                        commercial relations, including sound but imaginative loans.</p>
                    <p>In this way, I think we will gain in their respect and we will help them
                        develop sound enterprise. This program will not be popular with the
                        politicians temporarily in control of such countries <pb n="383"
                            xml:id="pg_383" facs="0413"/>as are currently receiving our support;
                        they want our money to spend for their own purposes and in their own way.
                        But such a program will certainly increase the respect for us of all sound
                        thinking citizens everywhere. And in the long run it will accomplish much
                        more.</p>

                                the billions which we now appropriate for economic aid abroad. The
                                fact that more countries would contribute to each project means that
                                the US percentage would be less than is the case under a bilateral

                                    is not “how much?” but “how?”. We might spend a good deal less
                                    in total dollars than we are now spending: the Russians seem to
                                    get big results with less money. The aim of “<gloss

                    <p>The General Assembly Ad Hoc Committee on <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> concluded its work on June 6. Its analysis of replies of
                        46 governments revealed considerable support for the early establishment of
                            <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> at the level of $200,000,000
                        to $250,000,000 for the first year. The replies of governments revealed many
                        disagreements on details of organization and administration of such a fund,
                        although there was majority support for an autonomous, independently
                        operating body. The United States, which neither replied to the
                        questionnaire of the Secretary General nor took an active part in the
                        meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee, will have to take a position in July on the
                        report of the Ad Hoc Committee and will be expected to define its basic
                        position with regard to <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government continues in a state of indecision. The
                        intra-departmental committee set up by Mr. <persName>Prochnow</persName> and
                        chaired by Emerson Ross is deeply divided. <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>
                        is strongly opposed to the establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> within the foreseeable future and strongly holds that a
                        fund of $200,000,000 to $250,000,000 would be altogether inadequate. The
                        type of organization and administration proposed for such a fund by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_SR1">Scheyven</persName> Report and generally
                        supported by the underdeveloped countries and some of the developed
                        countries would, in the opinion of <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>, make for
                        a scattering of resources, ineffectiveness and eventual disillusionment.
                            <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> is also inclined to discount the
                        political benefits we might derive from joining an International Development
                        Fund as well as the deleterious effects of our refusal to support it. Other
                        bureaus are divided. <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> on
                        the whole favor the early establishment of an international fund for
                        political reasons, while <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>, for reasons of their own, are more
                        interested in the regional approach. In the light of this situation, it is
                        anticipated that the intra-departmental committee will not be able to
                        produce a joint report and that the several reports which may issue will not
                        facilitate the formulation of a clear-cut position at the top-level.</p>

                                    <p>Any such consideration of a second stage in the development
                                        of technical assistance, which would include a considerable
                                        increase in supplies, should be guided by a determination to
                                        maintain and strengthen the multilateral approach and truly
                                        international character of technical assistance. Thus it
                                        should be made clear that no country could or should be
                                        expected to contribute more than 50% of the additional funds
                                        needed; that these funds should be freely convertible into
                                        usable currencies or given in the form of supplies
                                        considered helpful by international authorities responsible
                                        for the program.</p>
                                    <p>As to organization, the first stage (increase up to
                                        $50,000,000) would not require any fundamental changes in
                                        the present set-up except strengthening of personnel,
                                        particularly in <gloss target="#t_TAB1">TAB</gloss>. For the
                                        implementation of the second stage, the existing system
                                        would have to be strengthened and streamlined throughout.
                                        The <gloss target="#t_TAB1">TAB</gloss> might be
                                        reestablished as a sub-committee of the Administrative
                                        Committee on Coordination to bring it more directly under
                                        the supervision of the chief executive officers of the
                                        international organizations, including the Bank and the
                                        Monetary Fund, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary
                                        General; and <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> would have
                                        to be streamlined and probably reduced in size from the

                                        the 12 members would be the chief contributing countries.
                                        This, without instituting weighted voting and other highly
                                        unpopular devices, would give the United States a
                                        predominant position in the allocation of funds.</p>

                            >Humphrey</persName> on the subject of assistance programs administered
                        by multilateral organizations. I am greatly concerned by the two criticisms
                        you make.</p>
                    <p>We have not felt here in the Department—certainly I have not felt—that
                        international organizations are “extraordinarily inefficient and have a very
                        high rate of overhead” as you state. With respect to some phases of economic
                        development, the multilateral organizations may be relatively quite
                        efficient. While obviously there are numerous <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391"
                            facs="0421"/>problems in connection with any operation employing a
                        multilateral staff, there are also strengths in multilateral organizations
                        which we feel make their support an integral part of U.S. foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>The administrative cost of the United Nations Expanded Program of Technical
                        Assistance is about 7 per cent; that of the United Nations Children’s Fund
                        is about 10 per cent. Total overhead costs, including program backstopping
                        and central coordination, run about 16 per cent to 17 per cent for each
                        program. This may seem high, but I believe it is not excessive when compared
                        to comparable operations on a bilateral basis. Also, the proportion of
                        overhead costs has been coming down.</p>
                    <p>My own experience with these programs—both at home and abroad—has convinced
                        me that the bilateral and multilateral forms both have important
                        contributions to make to our foreign policy. Moreover, a good many
                        investigations made by objective individuals have led me to believe that
                        United Nations’ efforts compare pretty favorably with our own bilateral
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>Take, for example, the recent Technical Assistance report of Senator

                        expended than does the bilateral program of the United States. The
                        explanation may be that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has less money

                    <p>With regard to your second point, it is of course always possible that
                        unsuitable experts may be selected and that unsuitable projects may
                        sometimes be started in either the multilateral or bilateral program. It is
                        possible that countries may request projects from the United Nations
                        agencies to which we in the United States would not assign equal priority.
                        This is their prerogative as independent nations. I would however be very
                        much interested if you have evidence which indicates that our money is
                        “being spent to proselytize philosophies alien to our ideals”. This is a
                        serious charge which goes to the heart of our participation in international
                        organizations, and I am very much interested as to the basis for your
                        view.</p>

                    <p>The National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial
                        Problems adopted on June 26 a new policy guidance statement which clarifies

                            >IBRD</gloss> and redefines and enlarges the area in which the former
                        may operate.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2"><gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                            Action No. 897, June 26, “Statement Regarding the Relationship Between
                            the Activities of the Export-Import Bank and of the International Bank
                            for Reconstruction and Development.” The statement reads:<p>“1. The
                                activities of the Export-Import Bank and of the International Bank
                                are essentially complementary. Borrowers seeking to finance U.S.
                                goods and services normally may look to the Export-Import Bank as
                                the source of financing. Member countries of the International Bank
                                seeking to purchase goods on the basis of international competitive
                                bidding normally may look to that institution.</p>
                            <p>“2. In order to assist in avoiding duplication of effort, to preserve
                                the integrity of loans of both Banks, and to insure the most
                                effective utilization of funds by borrowing countries, it is
                                essential that the Banks should maintain close liaison.</p>
                            <p>“3. The <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> will, of course, continue
                                its statutory responsibilities of coordinating lending activities.”

                        approach the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> first. The <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> policy statement points out that the
                        activities of the two banks are essentially complementary, and that
                        borrowers seeking to finance US goods and services normally may look to the
                        Eximbank as the source of financing, while member countries of the <gloss

                    <p>The decision, while effective on a world-wide basis, stems primarily from the

                        principally and where it is presently endeavoring to increase the scope of

                        business or their affiliates without governmental guarantee; 2) US exporter

                        Eximbank loans is generally restricted to dollar purchases in the US, and
                        that such loans are made in dollars and repayment in dollars is required. On
                        the other hand, purchases financed by <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                        loans are not limited to the US but, except in unusual circumstances, are
                        made on the basis of international competitive bidding. Purchases under
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans may be made in any of the
                        fifty-eight member countries and in Switzerland and may be denominated in
                        dollars or in other currencies depending on the requirements of the
                        borrowers and the availability of such currencies to the International
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>The two banks are expected to maintain close liaison in order to avoid
                        duplication of effort and to preserve the integrity of the loans of both.
                        This is particularly important since both Banks may be operating in a given
                        country and even in a particular field in that country with no fixed
                        requirements of precedence.</p>

                    <p>The session began with a reading by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> of his prepared statement,<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2"
                            >A copy of the statement is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note> copies
                        of which were distributed to the Advisers. During the reading, Mr.
                            <persName>Fairless</persName> asked whether the initial sum of $250
                        million argued for by strong advocates of “<gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>” was to be contributed by the United States. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that $250 million
                        represented the total amount to be given by all the contributors. Mr.
                            <persName>Fairless</persName> wanted to know over how many nations that
                        grant fund would be spread. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that there would be some 30 or 40. Mr.
                            <persName>Fairless</persName> commented that with such a small sum there
                        would not be very much for any particular country; he wondered what could be
                        accomplished with so little money. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> agreed that economically the amount was not very
                        impressive, but tactically it was important. If such a program were
                        successful on a small scale, it could be expanded, and from the very
                        beginning it could be controlled by the United States.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had finished reading
                        his speech, Mr. <persName>D</persName>eupree wanted to know whether
                        “approve” was the correct word in the sentence, “The easiest way to
                        accomplish this would be to require that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss> approve all requests for allocations.”, of paragraph 6 on
                        page 4, or whether the Ambassador had intended to use the word “review”. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that “approve” was
                        the word he had meant. Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> then asked why the
                        World Bank couldn’t implement the projects, since it would be approving
                        allocations for them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said
                        that those particular projects which it would be approving were ones of
                        which the Bank could not take care.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> wanted to know when it would
                        be advisable for the President to make his appearance advocating our
                        participation in a <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0426"/>program of the
                        type which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had outlined.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that if the President
                        were to make his recommendation now or in his State of the Union message, it
                        would be most helpful, particularly since Shepilov<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d152fn3">Dmitri T. Shepilov replaced Vyacheslav Molotov as
                            Soviet Foreign Minister on June 1, 1956.</note> had made his declaration
                        last week advocating the establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> wanted to know whether the organization Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had proposed would not be
                        just another agency giving out aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that it would not, that it would be doing
                        something no other organization was doing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> wanted to know whether the
                        bitterness in Egypt wouldn’t prevent us from doing anything there. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> answered that Egypt would
                        have to be judged against the proviso that aid should not be given to a
                        country which had seriously violated international standards of
                        behavior.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> asked who would coordinate the proposed
                        program with existing aid programs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that the man who ran it would be responsible
                        for carrying out the necessary coordination. It would be under the aegis of
                        the United Nations without being under the control of the United Nations.
                        Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> commented that he couldn’t see that it
                        would be under any control.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> asked to what countries in
                        the Near East Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> anticipated
                        aid would be given under a multilateral aid program. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that all countries in the
                        Near East which had honored their obligations would be eligible. They would
                        need aid as soon as the troops moved out and negotiations concerning the
                        Canal were begun. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> said the
                        situation offered the United States a wonderful opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> remarked that some countries didn’t like to
                        accept bilateral aid for political reasons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> said that that statement was correct, that the newly
                        independent nations were afraid of being dominated or taken over when aid
                        was proffered under bilateral arrangements. Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName>
                        asked what the United States would get out of a multilateral aid program.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that we would have
                        helped countries to get on their feet and to be in a position to fight for
                        themselves, if there were a war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> wanted to know whether under Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s proposal the amount specified for
                        the United States to contribute would be increased if a clamor to do so were
                        raised. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that the
                        specified amount would not be raised, that the contribution of each country
                        was on a percentage basis and all contributions would be in convertible
                        currency.</p>
                    <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0427"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> said that he could see a strategic value for
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s plan but not an economic
                        one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that, of
                        course, its strategic value was the fact that it would get us out of a
                        defensive position. Economically the plan was not going to do big things,
                        but it would give us a modus operandi which would be useful, and it would be
                        a good method to use in the Near East. Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> said
                        that he was sure it would superinduce a clamor for more funds. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that the system had a built-in
                        brake which had worked very well in the technical assistance program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> asked why it had been suggested that the
                        United States’ contribution be 40 per cent instead of the usual 331/3 per
                        cent. It seemed to him that it would be a more open way of handling things
                        to keep it at the regular per cent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> said he also preferred the lower figure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> asked what size fund Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> thought would be needed
                        since he felt that $250 million was too large. Would he consider $100
                        million to be sufficiently large? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> answered that he felt $50 to $60 million contributed
                        by the United States would be a realistic amount. Mr.
                            <persName>Fairless</persName> said that if that were on an annual basis,
                        he wanted to know for how long the commitment would be. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that the commitment would be
                        continuing, that the length for which it would run would be decided by a
                        resolution of the General Assembly, that he hadn’t thought in terms of a
                        particular period, but that certainly it ought to be at least five
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> wanted to know whether the whole idea wasn’t
                        merely a political gesture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that he didn’t think so, that it was a means
                        for starting a needed program of economic development. Mr.
                            <persName>Deupree</persName> said that it was so small that he couldn’t
                        see it as more than a political gesture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that only $15 million had been spent annually
                        by the United States on the United Nations technical assistance program, but
                        the program had economic merit.</p>
                    <p>Governor Darden asked what protection the fund would have against subscribers
                        dropping out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that
                        there was the proviso that the fund wouldn’t operate unless the
                        contributions by the large countries were convertible. Mr.
                            <persName>Fairless</persName> said that as he saw it, the purpose of the
                        program would be to establish a principle. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> said that that was right, that they were trying to
                        develop a method that was not only useful but would also put the United

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> asked what the arguments would be in favor of
                        maintaining both multilateral aid as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> proposed and bilateral aid as it was dispensed by
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that there was a definite need for both kinds.
                        There was a limit to what could be <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0428"
                        />done multilaterally because of the convertibility clause. On the other
                        hand, there were also limits to what could be done bilaterally because of
                        touchy political situations such as that in the Near East. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> asked in what other areas
                        multilateral aid would be useful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> said that it would be a valuable approach in weak
                        countries along the Russian border. Mr. <persName>Deupree</persName> asked
                        whether Russia wouldn’t be able to use her veto. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that it would not, since the
                        matter wouldn’t go before the Security Council. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> commented that the suggested program
                        certainly gave a necessary flexibility of approach.</p>
                    <p>Commander <persName>Johnston</persName> asked whether Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had in mind doing away with
                        bilateral aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied
                        that he did not. Mr. <persName>Tapp</persName> asked how much had been spent
                        for technical assistance by the United Nations. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that the amount in the 1957
                        budget to be contributed by the United States was $15.5 million. Mr.
                            <persName>Tapp</persName> asked whether there were any specific projects
                        which would engender the need for grants. Governor Darden commented that the
                        proposed multilateral aid program would probably lighten the United States
                        load.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WRF1">Woodward</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> to give his views on bilateral aid,
                        since he had said that he felt there was a strong need for it. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that there were situations
                        in which the United States needed to take decisive action without waiting
                        for the agreement of others. There were cases in which the United States
                        would want to have sole control of the purse strings. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WRF1">Woodward</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> whether he was satisfied that we
                        were getting value for the money that we were spending on aid programs. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that he felt that
                        the aid we were giving was very beneficial but that not even we had enough
                        money to remake the world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bennett</persName> wanted to know whether there were contained
                        in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s proposal sufficient
                        safeguards to make the results of the program different from those of
                        previous multilateral aid programs, such as the one sponsored by the United
                        Nations in Korea and UNRRA. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that the United Nations had only
                        recommendatory powers and couldn’t force us to accept a program which we
                        didn’t like. We could make our offer and say that that was it. If it were
                        accepted, it would be impossible for the terms to be changed without our
                        consent. The weakness of the program was that it would never be able to
                        become very big. As far as other multilateral aid programs were concerned,
                        it should be remembered that the Palestine relief program had been under the
                        administration of capable Americans, and so had the Korean program, though
                        the foreign contributions to the programs hadn’t been convertible. Mr.
                            <persName>Bennett</persName> asked what would happen if Russia made a
                        proposal concerning a multilateral aid program before we did. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> answered <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399"
                            facs="0429"/>that we would then be on the defensive and would have to
                        take a rearguard action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRWE1">Reid</persName> asked what backing the
                        President needed in order to approve the program. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that the President needed
                        the approval of Congress, but before they would give their approval he would
                        have to recommend that they give it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Mullin</persName> asked whether the major powers would buy and
                        contribute to the proposed program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> replied that Russia would be bothered by it. Before
                        the Suez situation had arisen, both the British and the French had said that
                        they liked it. There had been no comments from them recently.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bennett</persName> asked whether the program could be started
                        in selected countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                        replied that it might well be begun in the countries of the Near East.</p>

                            South America at the time. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            suggested that the participants try to get together early in September

                                    Shepilov.</note> on November 22 announced to the General
                                Assembly that the Soviet Union is prepared to participate in a
                                United Nations Fund for the development of underdeveloped countries.
                                I am convinced that this announcement, along with the agitation for
                                a world economic conference, is basically a propaganda move;
                                nevertheless, if we fail to take any action, the Soviets will win a
                                substantial propaganda victory at no expense to them.</item>

                            <item>It is generally agreed that some substantial program of economic
                                assistance will be needed to rebuild the Middle East and advance our
                                prestige in that area. There are clear signs that bilateral programs
                                would not be welcome in certain countries of that area, whereas a
                                multilateral United Nations program with United States participation
                                would be very well received. There is the danger that in the absence
                                of such United Nations action Soviet bilateral programs may attempt
                                to fill the gap. For these reasons I feel that there must be a
                                meeting of minds—and a decision—on this subject very soon.</item>

                                dollar amount would be $40,000,000 (earmarked out of existing
                                expenditures), and there is a strong chance that the scheme would
                                never be agreed to at all because of the control features which are
                                so favorable to us. In any event, it is a small effort to make to
                                forestall the harm to us which would come from a Soviet victory in
                                this field.</item>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that he was a firm
                        believer in economic assistance as an instrument of American foreign policy,
                        and that he had had a great deal of experience with it in his capacity as
                        Executive Director of the Staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
                        Without a doubt Greece and Turkey would have collapsed if they had not
                        received aid, and conditions in Europe would have deteriorated. Some measure
                        of continuing foreign aid was inescapable. The question was whether it ought
                        to be extended bilaterally or multilaterally. Actually the question of how
                        aid ought to be extended was not an either/or question; both forms of aid
                        were necessary. Multilateral aid had certain advantages. For instance, the
                        Technical Assistance Program of the United Nations during its six years of
                        existence had received contributions from 78 different countries to the
                        amount of $142 million. 131 countries and territories had helped in carrying
                        out the program. 505 thousand experts had served it in an advisory capacity
                        of one form or another. Over 10 thousand fellowships had been awarded for
                        study abroad. Mr. <persName>Lewis</persName> asked whether this was part of
                        the cultural program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName>
                        replied that it wasn’t, that it wasn’t connected with the student exchange
                        program, that it was carried out on a technical level. India, Pakistan, and
                        Burma were countries where three of the four largest phases of the program
                        were.</p>
                    <p>There were instances in which it was better to give aid bilaterally, for
                        instance aid to Korea, Vietnam, and the Republic of China under <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480. The multilateral approach, on the
                        other hand, <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0432"/>sometimes had
                        advantages over bilateral aid. In thinking about that, it was good to keep
                        in mind such international organizations as the previously mentioned United
                        Nations Technical Assistance Program, the World Health Organization, the
                        International Labor Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and
                        the United Nations Scientific, Educational, and Cultural Organization. Many
                        of the newly independent countries were allergic to conditions that were
                        often imposed with bilateral aid. Sometimes other countries were
                        apprehensive about bilateral aid. For instance, aid to Morocco or Tunisia
                        would raise apprehension in France. It was sometimes easier to mobilize
                        necessary talents and skills from the wider pool offered by a group of
                        nations. The United States didn’t have enough manpower to supply all that
                        was needed in rendering foreign aid. Frequently technicians from a third
                        country could do a better job than those from the United States and were
                        more readily accepted. The burden of multilateral aid would be less for the
                        American taxpayer. There was certainly no conflict between the two kinds of
                        aid. The United Nations programs were working fairly well in the field. They
                        were making an impact and were reaching down to the grass roots.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union was making a determined effort to win the cold war through
                        the United Nations and its agencies. Until 1950 the USSR had paid no
                        attention to the special programs except to criticize and condemn them. Now
                        they belonged to the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>; they were trying to rejoin <gloss
                            target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss> of which they had been a member previously;
                        and it was likely that they would join <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>.
                        It was to be hoped that the United States would continue to be a part of
                        those programs and perhaps approve a modest increase in its contribution for
                        an expanded Technical Assistance Program. Over the next five years the
                        program might be moved up to $50 million with the United States contribution
                        increased only a few million dollars to take care of its part. An expanded
                        program, incidentally, could be administered at about the same cost as the
                        present one. It was also to be hoped that the United States would approve a
                        proposal that Canada was developing for submission and which would call for
                        a case analysis with respect to the character of both bilateral and
                        multilateral economic aid going to underdeveloped countries. Such a study
                        would be extremely valuable from the viewpoint of the United States and
                        would give a much firmer basis for planning than now existed.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion Period</hi></p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName> said that it was his
                        personal opinion that the various types of aid which the United States was
                        extending must go <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0433"/>on to the limit
                        of the ability of the country to finance them. He wanted to know who was
                        going to establish priorities for the various types of aid. He had a feeling
                        that priorities were pretty well established by the Bureau of the Budget.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that it might be true
                        that the Bureau of the Budget appeared to establish priorities, but in
                        reality they had been previously determined by the various departments.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName> asked how that was done.
                        Mr. <persName>Claxton</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">Philander P.
                            Claxton, Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State for
                            Congressional Relations.</note> said that it was true that the judgment
                        of the Bureau of the Budget was leaned upon heavily as far as totals were
                        concerned, but the departments made the determination as far as countries
                        and programs were concerned. General <persName>Smith</persName> asked again
                        who decided on the priorities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1"
                            >Wilcox</persName> said that actually the decision on priorities was a
                        political decision and should be a Department of State matter with other
                        interested departments being consulted. General <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Smith</persName> said that in the past such a system for determining
                        priorities had never worked as smoothly as desired; he wondered what the
                        case was now. Mr. <persName>Frechtling</persName><note n="3"
                            xml:id="d154fn3">Louis E. Frechtling of the Office of the Special

                            Secretary of State.</note> said that it worked pretty much as had been
                        outlined and that the final decision rested with the Secretary of State.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName> wondered whether some
                        other agency or activity which operated independently was needed. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that the problem had
                        disturbed him because he realized that the catalog of needs for each country
                        came largely from the country itself, not an unprejudiced source. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Smith</persName> said that the Department of
                        Defense had <persName>O’Neil</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d154fn4"
                            >Identity unclear. W.J. McNeil was Assistant Secretary of Defense
                            (Comptroller).</note> but there was no one in a similar capacity for the
                        government as a whole. The Bureau of the Budget was not skilled in certain
                        fields, and therefore it could not always give the skilled adjudication that
                        was needed. Mr. <persName>Claxton</persName> commented that any matter of
                        concern could still be taken to the President.</p>
                    <p>Governor Darden said that he was gravely concerned about the Canadian
                        proposal relative to bilateral agreements that was to be presented at the
                        United Nations. He didn’t like the idea of airing our affairs in the United
                        Nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that the
                        contents of our bilateral agreements were pretty well known, that he had
                        been referring only to those concerned with economic aid… .</p>

                        encouraging, as is your continued interest in helping the under-developed
                        countries of the world to achieve stability and rising living standards.</p>
                    <p>Your suggestion that we should stop talking about foreign aid and instead
                        speak of “investment for peace” is a ten-strike. Semantics are important,
                        and we could think of no two words that handicap a program more than <hi

                    <p>We take issue with only one statement you made and that is that it would be
                        more difficult to win the support of the public for a program for the
                        under-developed countries than it was to win support for the <persName

                        one significant fact,—the deep, abiding confidence the American public has
                        in you. At the time the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Marshall</persName> Plan
                        was presented to the public confidence in former President Truman was at a
                        low ebb and yet that plan won overwhelming support. An “investment for
                        peace” in the form of help for the under-developed countries would, if
                        proposed by you, not only win enthusiastic acceptance here, but throughout
                        the free world. It is our fervent hope that you would be willing to let it
                        become known as the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                        Plan.</p>
                    <p>We have excellent bilateral programs with some under-developed countries.

                            investment of approximately $5.2 billion in the public sectors of the

                        But to the best of our knowledge no overall study has been made of the needs
                        and resources of the under-developed countries in which some 900 million
                        people live. As I stated to you in our conversation on Saturday, the gross
                        national product of these countries in 1954 was approximately
                        $85,000,000,000. In that same year the gross national <pb n="405"
                            xml:id="pg_405" facs="0435"/>product of the 380 million people living in
                        the industrialized countries (those with a per capita income of $500. per
                        person, or more) was $567,000,000,000.</p>
                    <p>Not only are we lacking this overall study, but there is not even presently
                        available a comprehensive, regional plan for the economic development of the
                        Middle East. There are bits and pieces, but no coordinated program. We may
                        need this—and quickly.</p>
                    <p>We are not proposing that any effort be made at this time to embark upon a
                        master plan for the development of all under-developed areas. We are not
                        ready for that. There is a desperate need, however, for an inventory of the
                        present resources and the short-term needs of the under-developed countries
                        of the world, and most particularly of the nineteen new nations which have
                        won their independence since the end of World War II. In using the phrase,
                        short-term needs, we are thinking solely of the needs for increased
                        productivity in agriculture and industry, and for the strengthening of their
                        governments. We are not thinking of the bottomless needs for consumption
                        goods. We are also thinking in terms of six years. We use “six years” merely
                        to get away from the phrase, “five-year plan.”</p>
                    <p>This inventory of short-term needs and resources should, in our opinion, be
                        carried out under the auspices of the United Nations, provided the United
                        Nations secretariat is willing to set up a special group for this purpose.
                        We are certain that this study can be made free from interference by the
                        Soviets and their sympathizers.</p>
                    <p>This proposed inventory would not legally bind us to help any country with
                        any goods or services. At the same time there would certainly be an
                        implication of help which we would want to take into full account. However,
                        there are numerous safeguards which could be included in the proposal. For
                        example, we could point out that the United States was in a position to
                        supply certain goods and services while other goods and services could be
                        better supplied by other countries. The emphasis should always be on goods
                        and services, not <hi rend="italic">dollars</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >gold</hi>.</p>
                    <p>I told you the simple truth on Saturday when I said that second only to peace
                        itself the interest of the delegates in this Eleventh General Assembly is in
                        the development of the under-developed areas. The one specific proposal
                        before the Assembly is <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, which
                        calls for all the nations to contribute proportionately to an investment
                        fund of approximately $250,000,000. The amount of money is not enough, the
                        methods of distributing it are subject to grave question, and, in fact, the
                        whole proposal is dubious. However, it has widespread support not only from
                        all the under-developed countries but also from many European countries and
                        from Russia. Our guess is that Russia is for it because we are against it.
                        Since <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0436"/><gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> cannot be formed without our support, they feel safe in
                        offering their proportionate share of the original capital. We are not
                        overly concerned with the tactical situation that we are facing, even though
                        it does present difficulties. What we are concerned about is getting
                        underway with a program which will, as soon as possible, help these
                        countries to help themselves toward stability and better living
                        standards.</p>
                    <p>It is our deep conviction that the time is here and now for a specific
                        proposal. Abstractions are not enough. Further, the climate is extremely
                        favorable for the making of a specific proposal. The position which you took
                        in the Middle East crisis brought the East and West much closer together.
                        You proved that Kipling was wrong when he said, “Never the twain shall
                        meet.” Another dramatic move by you and the free world will be united as it
                        never has been before. What we would like to suggest is that you personally
                        come to the United Nations and offer a package deal consisting of the
                        following items: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>An offer to recommend to the Congress appropriate participation by
                                the United States of America in the financing of the inventory of
                                needs and resources which we have been discussing.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>A modest participation by the United States in the multilateral
                                aid program under the United Nations and, particularly, such a
                                program for the Middle East. (Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> has explained the need for
                                such a program in detail in a separate memorandum.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Continuing and slightly expanded support for the United Nations

                        </list></p>
                    <p>This package deal would electrify the United Nations with a response even
                        greater than you received for your Atoms for Peace proposal. Further and
                        finally, if out of the inventory of needs and resources a United States
                        program for helping the under-developed countries did come about, the
                        results, in our opinion, would be even more far-reaching than were the
                        results from the <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Marshall</persName> Plan.<note

                    <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by explaining the nature of the problem to
                        be discussed and pointing out that it was the duty of the group, if at all
                        possible, to resolve the issues before it without taking the matter to the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then outlined the contributions which the United States has
                        made to various United Nations programs. He went on to say that there are a
                        good many situations which it is in the national interest to handle
                        bilaterally, particularly since most of our economic aid is tied in closely
                        to military assistance. This, he felt, is especially true of the Middle
                        East. He said he could not conceive of our economic programs there being
                        conducted on a multilateral basis as Mr. <persName>Hammarskjold</persName>
                        had suggested. In this area we want to distinguish between the sheep and the
                        goats—we want to build up those nations resisting communism and deny help to
                        those with communist leanings. It is difficult for the United Nations to
                        make these distinctions since it cannot lend itself to the political
                        implications that we have in mind.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also pointed out that certain bilateral arrangements are
                        necessary to accomplish our economic assistance objectives. Unless Congress
                        would authorize additional funds to finance further United Nations
                        activities, he did not see how we could increase our multilateral assistance
                        since that would require the elimination of certain essential bilateral
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> presented his views
                        in the form of a 12 page memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">This
                            memorandum, entitled “Multilateral Aid under the United Nations,” is
                            similar to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s statement of
                            November 30, 1956 (see <ref target="#d152">Document 152</ref>). No copy
                            was attached to the source text, but one is attached to the copy of

                            Files: Lot 59 <gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss> 471.</note> He urged that
                        the United States demonstrate its <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0438"
                        />willingness to participate in a limited economic development program under
                        the United Nations. Our interests would be safeguarded by a system of
                        weighted voting and supervision of the program by the International Bank.
                        All nations would contribute to the fund at the same ratio as they now
                        contribute to the United Nations regular budget. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stated that in his judgment the
                        United States could effectively control the program, that it would involve
                        only a small portion of our total economic assistance, and that it would win
                        a great deal of support for us in the United Nations. A copy of Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s statement is
                        attached.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> stated that he was
                        “scared to death” of a common pool from which economic assistance might be
                        dispensed. In such circumstances, he felt it would be impossible for the
                        United States to control the situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that our experience with the Atomic Energy Agency had
                        proved disappointing. We took the leadership in creating the Agency and we
                        will supply most of the materials, yet other countries are raising
                        objections to American management of the Agency. When we start such things,
                        he said, it is always difficult to know where they are going to end.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HP1">Hoffman</persName> pointed out the difficulty
                        of employing American personnel for technical assistance and for economic
                        development programs. He was convinced, he said, the United Nations could do
                        a better job at a lower price than we could do on a bilateral basis. He said
                        he supported the Lodge proposal not because he was sure of the details but
                        because it would constitute an important experiment which we ought to go
                        through with. The question we have to answer is “Is the United Nations
                        important for us?” If so, then we ought to keep in mind that next to peace
                        itself the problem most important to the underdeveloped countries is
                        economic development.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, he said he was not recommending that a great amount be
                        spent, and he recalled that in the <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Marshall</persName> Plan our contribution never went beyond 3% of the
                        gross national product of Western Europe. He believed we should experiment
                        with multilateral economic development as we did with technical assistance 7
                        years ago. A modest program with safeguards would have the following effect: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>It would help the underdeveloped countries more than we could help
                                them with purely bilateral assistance and</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>It would persuade people in the United Nations that we are
                                genuinely interested in their progress.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0439"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft">He felt that the technical assistance program had succeeded
                        with the use of only a small amount of money and that further
                        experimentation in the economic development field would be justified. He
                        argued that we have broken the Asian-African bloc in the General Assembly
                        and the underdeveloped countries are looking to us for continuing
                        leadership. The announcement of our participation in such a program would
                        have an electric effect in New York.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that we cannot disentangle economic aid from
                        military assistance. In Korea, Turkey, and elsewhere economic aid is the
                        necessary complement to our military assistance. Military aid in the Middle
                        East, he thought, was quite different from the <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Marshall</persName> Plan which was used in highly industrialized
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HP1">Hoffman</persName> stated that we should apply
                        one simple rule—we should contribute to projects where there is a
                        demonstrable need and where those projects can be successfully carried out.
                        Economic development was by no means a bottomless pit because the
                        under-developed countries could absorb only a limited amount of
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> commented that we
                        have three committees<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">The Fairless Committee was
                            still in session. A second study was being conducted concurrently by the
                            International Development Advisory Board, concentrating on technical
                            assistance and economic aid. A third committee, the Interdepartmental
                            Committee on Certain U.S. Aid Programs, composed of representatives of
                            the Departments of State, the Treasury, Defense, and of the
                            International Cooperation Administration, completed an examination of
                            the military programs in six countries in August 1956. In addition to
                            the investigations initiated by the Executive branch, House and Senate
                            committees were also undertaking independent inquiries into various
                            aspects of American aid programs.</note> working on our aid programs at
                        the present time and that undoubtedly a number of changes will be suggested
                        in the next few weeks. He thought, therefore, that it would be inopportune
                        to jump in now with new proposals for multilateral aid before we receive the
                        reports of the Committees conducting the studies. He also questioned whether
                        sufficient funds would be forthcoming from other countries to make a
                        multilateral development program possible. The Dutch and the Germans, he
                        thought, might put up some funds but most other countries were not in a
                        position to do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> commented that the
                        request which had been made recently by the Secretary General for aid to
                        Hungary had not met with encouraging responses. Other countries thus far, he
                        said, have not put up any money.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> stated that if other
                        countries were not in a position to contribute to a development program, the
                        United States should go ahead anyway and make a bona fide offer to
                        participate in such a program. If other contributions were not forthcoming,
                        at least we would get the credit for having made the offer.</p>
                    <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0440"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said he thought the arguments of those who favored the program
                        were somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand it was argued the program could
                        be successfully carried out. On the other hand, it was argued that the
                        necessary funds probably would not be forthcoming but that we should support
                        it as a propaganda move.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that he
                        believed the program could be successfully launched. However, even if
                        insuperable obstacles should arise, he still felt it would be in our
                        national interest to indicate our willingness to support it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> said he was glad to see
                        there had been no tendency during the discussion to link disarmament with
                        economic development. Either economic development is logical or it is not—in
                        any event he felt it ought not to be related to the disarmament problem. He
                        also urged that we keep open the idea of some multilateral assistance
                        disassociated from the United Nations. There might be projects in which we
                        would want to enlist the assistance of other nations outside the framework
                        of the United Nations. North Africa, for example, might well be developed by
                        the countries of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then suggested, in line with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName>’s remarks, that it might be well to
                        let further consideration of this matter go over until the reports of the
                        Committees now studying the problem are completed. He recognized that
                        members of the group could take the matter to the President if they so
                        desired. He thought that in view of the different opinions expressed in the
                        meeting, however, the President would not be inclined to make an affirmative
                        decision with respect to the program. The Secretary went on to say that one
                        possible advantage of multilateral aid might stem from the creation of an
                        international pool or panel of people which could be drawn upon for
                        technical assistance and economic development purposes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> suggested that the
                        International Bank could raise large sums of money which could be made
                        available for development purposes. He felt that it would be better to use
                        existing instrumentalities of this kind—such as the Bank, the International
                        Finance Corporation, etc.—rather than to create a new organization or new
                        channels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HP1">Hoffman</persName> pointed out,
                        however, that the funds of <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> ordinarily
                        could not be loaned in underdeveloped countries with primitive
                        economies.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that it would be impossible to arrive at any substantive
                        changes in United States policy on economic development in time for the
                        delegation in New York to put forward any new proposals during the present
                        session of the General Assembly. The Secretary suggested that the delegation
                        permit the initiative <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0441"/>with respect
                        to <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> to remain with other
                        delegations. It was agreed, however, that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HP1"
                            >Hoffman</persName> might inquire of certain delegations their concept
                        of such a program and particularly the extent to which their governments
                        might contribute to a multilateral economic development fund. This should be
                        done carefully in such a way as to avoid any commitment on our part that the
                        United States might be willing to participate in such a program.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName></hi>:
                        I do appreciate the attention you gave to my proposal on multilateral aid.
                        While I am sorry that I was not more convincing, I welcome your idea of
                        finding out how much money others are willing to put into a multilateral
                        fund.</p>
                    <p>There is one last thought which I would like to submit and then I hope not to
                        bother you any more on this subject. It is this:</p>
                    <p>My proposal is not “phony”. What is “phony” is the attitude of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> advocates. In actual truth, (although
                        they would not state it this way) their attitude is that a fund called <hi
                            rend="italic">“international”</hi> should be in essence <hi
                            rend="italic">financed by the United States</hi>, with <hi rend="italic"
                            >no requirements for contributions by others;</hi> and with <hi
                            rend="italic">no requirements for convertibility</hi>. Merely to state
                        such a proposal demonstrates its absurdity. Such a fund is not truly
                        international and to say that it is, in my opinion, is “phony”. My proposal
                        would smoke out the hypocrites and bring much needed realism into the world
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>This is worth doing.</p>
                    <p>To set up a soundly conceived international fund is worth doing too, and
                        would be much to the best interests of the U.S., since there are, as I said,
                        some distinct advantages which a multilateral operation has over a bilateral
                        one, particularly at this time. Such a fund would necessarily be small
                        because no international fund—if it is truly international—can be large.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            >Paul</persName> describes as an “investment for peace”. Since then we
                        had a good talk last Thursday with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot
                            Lodge</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HP1">Paul</persName> at which
                        we thoroughly explored the plan which <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Cabot</persName> had previously discussed with Ben Fairless’ Committee.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">George Humphrey</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_HJB1">John Hollister</persName>, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence Randall</persName>, among others,
                        participated in this discussion. It developed that there were two reasons
                        underscored by <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HP1">Paul</persName> in favor of the plan: (1) The
                        substantive merits of the good that could be accomplished in those instances
                        where, due to suspicions and prejudices perhaps in less developed areas of
                        the world, multilateral aid might be more acceptable than bilateral aid; and
                        (2) according to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>, the Soviet
                        Union would be on the spot. If the Soviet Union refused to participate, the
                        plan would fail because it is based on matching of funds and we would have
                        gained a propaganda victory. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>
                        doubts that the Soviet Union would contribute.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HG2">George Humphrey</persName>, of course, is ardently
                        opposed to this type of scheme. He feels that our international exchange
                        position is such that we must seek ways of reducing our contributions abroad
                        with their consequent drain on the dollar. He also emphasized that three
                        important committees are now at work on a survey of our entire foreign aid
                        system. Before having the benefit of their findings it would be unwise to
                        embark on a new program. This would seem to be common sense.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>, of course, was eager to take
                        affirmative action during the present session of the General Assembly with
                        the matter coming up in Committee II this week. It was agreed, however, that
                        under the circumstances our Mission in New York would limit its discussion
                        of this item to inquiries. These, we hope, would elicit from other
                        delegations an indication of the degree of support other nations might be
                        interested in giving a multilateral aid plan. Our representatives by
                        questions would endeavor to obtain clarification regarding plans and ideas
                        that other governments may have on this subject. During the interval we
                        would be in possession of the views of the <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413"
                            facs="0443"/>three U.S. committees. After that we would be in far better
                        position to make a useful determination than we are now.</p>

                                Delegation should bear the following in mind: In explaining its vote
                                in favor of this resolution, the U.S. Delegation recalled the
                                understanding as to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee arrived at
                                during the 10th Session of the General Assembly, i.e., to carry on
                                the orderly exploration, already initiated by the United Nations, of
                                the various ideas and suggestions which governments may have
                                relative to the proposed special fund, which may be useful when the
                                fund becomes a practical possibility. The Delegation stated that in
                                its view the resolution adopted by the 11th General Assembly
                                provided for further work along these lines. The Ad Hoc Committee
                                was being asked to give a fuller, more orderly and helpful picture
                                of the various organizational patterns or forms of legal framework
                                on which an international development fund could be established. The
                                Committee was not being asked to select from among these various
                                patterns a particular pattern, or combination of elements from
                                different patterns, which it would recommend as <hi rend="italic"

                                to participate.</p>
                            <p>The Delegation should endeavor to keep the new work of the Ad Hoc

                    <p>My outstanding impression is that the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"

                        full potential is not now being utilized. I sounded out the Heads of many
                        Delegations on the role of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, and
                        was asked to luncheon by Secretary-General Hammarskjold to discuss the
                        future of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. It is generally agreed
                        by the Secretary-General and those who have worked with <gloss

                        has come for setting it on a new course. Many state their opinion that the
                        organization has become sterile, receives little attention in the press, and
                        is not influencing public policy in the economic and social fields. In Latin

                        “has become the wailing wall of lost illusions!” The United States, which

                        foreign investments made by American business in 1956, the World Bank, The
                        International Finance Corporation, and other U.S.-sponsored activities. Yet
                        this <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0447"/>answer is not satisfactory to
                        other countries. They look to the United States for new ideas, and for
                        vigorous leadership.</p>
                    <p>The unfortunate consequences of U.S. negativism are illustrated by our
                        currently weak strategic position on <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>. We are unable to argue that a multilateral development
                        fund is unnecessary or undesirable, because the Presidential statement of
                        April 1953 commits the U.S. to participate in such a fund. We are also
                        debarred from arguing that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should not
                        go ahead to establish <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> on the
                        ground that the nature of the fund is vague and indefinite, because the U.S.
                        has so far refused even to set forth its own ideas regarding the Fund.
                        Therefore, we are driven back to the argument that establishment of such a
                        fund now is untimely. (See my statement on <hi rend="italic">Financing

                        ahead with the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> idea, we begin

                        more useful function, if the organ is not to become a positive danger to us.
                        For this reason I made a start by sponsoring and pushing through a
                        resolution—which received unanimous support—calling upon the Secretariat for
                        a thorough study of the extent and causes of inflation and the measures used
                        or contemplated by various Governments for combating inflation (see
                        attached). This study should provide the basis for a discussion in depth of
                        one crucial problem of public policy in the next <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"

                    <p>Secretary-General Hammarskjold asked my suggestions for increasing the
                        vitality of the Council. I suggested several reforms. First, the Agenda
                        should be limited to no more than 5 or 6 items representing major questions
                        of economic and social policy. The means of combating price inflation is an
                        illustration of a major policy issue that should be on the Agenda. All minor
                        technical questions should be left to the decisions of committees. <hi
                            rend="italic">Second</hi>, several days or a week should be reserved for
                        a true debate in depth on each of these major issues. <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Admittedly, this would bring <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> into
                        the realm of policy discussion, which would involve some hazards. However,
                        the risks are well worth running in the interests of giving the work of
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> a definite bearing on public
                        policies throughout the world. There are many economic and social problems

                    <p>I believe that it would be wise to establish an <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> Policy Planning Group within the U.S. Government, and to
                        assign it the specific task of producing a long-range U.S. policy and
                        program for <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. Such a Group might
                        include a number of qualified persons from outside the Government, such as a

                        important American business corporation with international interests. The
                        Group should meet regularly until a course has been plotted that can be
                        transmitted to higher authorities for review and adoption. The U.S. should

                    <p>An outstanding impression of the session is the attitude of conciliation and
                        cooperation displayed by the Soviet Delegation. The Soviets introduced the
                        following six principal resolutions: a) <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss>
                        to study the effect of the European Common Market, b) the Secretary-General
                        to study the effects of <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">Euratom</gloss> on world
                        cooperation, c) the Regional Economic Commissions to study the peaceful uses
                        of atomic energy, d) create a world trade organization, e) each nation to
                        reduce defense expenditure by 10–15 percent next year, f) hold a world
                        conference of economists.</p>
                    <p>The United States was, however successful in “watering down” or causing the
                        withdrawal of all these proposals. Right up to the end of the meeting the
                        Soviet representatives were obviously eager to find a means of reaching
                        agreement, and did not display their accustomed truculence. It is evident
                        that grave mistakes in central economic planning have created internal
                        difficulties from which the Soviet Bloc countries are seeking escape through
                        wider trade. The Soviets have a deep fear of the economic integration of
                        Western Europe through the Common Market and <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1"
                            >Euratom</gloss>. Although my speeches on The World Economic and Social

                        ideology at a number of points, the Soviet statements stressed peaceful
                        cooperation and “co- existence”.</p>
                    <p>As a method of defining issues, I invited the three principal Soviet
                        representatives to take lunch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KWM1"
                            >Kotschnig</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1"
                            >Stibravy</persName>, and myself. Later, they returned our hospitality
                        by inviting a small group of us to luncheon. They appeared to talk freely
                        and to be at ease with us and with each other, and repeatedly emphasized the
                        desirability of broader exchange of personnel and ideas between our
                        countries. We advised them that most of their proposals involved the
                        establishment of new machinery and it was better to use present
                        international machinery more intensively.</p>

                            Agencies.</hi></p>
                    <p>Another impression is that the Council succeeded in this session in gaining a
                        firmer control of the activities of the Secretariat and of the Specialized
                        Agencies, in the face of determined opposition by the latter. This
                        resistance to control was manifested in the request by the Council to the
                        Secretariat to study means of combating inflation as a major subject in the
                        next World Economic Survey. Initially, there was resistance by the
                        Secretariat to any direction whatever of its research activities, but this
                        resistance abated later on. It was also manifest in a resolution calling
                        upon the Secretary General for a five-year forecast of expenditures under
                        present programs, and calling upon the Heads of <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>, <gloss

                        for similar statements.—Again there was some opposition. However, the
                        Charter of the United Nations not only permits but requires <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> to give general direction, which is
                        obviously necessary and desirable if the Council is to carry out its
                        responsibilities to act as a coordinating agency in social and economic
                        policy. What appears to have been a somewhat lax and timid attitude by the
                        Council now is in process of correction.</p>

                    <p>I was impressed by the efforts of the Representatives of Poland<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d161fn7">Jerzy Michalowski, Permanent Representative to the

                            Brilej, Permanent Representative to the United Nations.</note> to
                        emphasize to me, in private conversations, the distinctions between their
                        countries and the USSR. There was an obvious effort to convince me that
                        their countries pursue as independent courses as they are able to follow,
                        and are eager to expand their cultural and trading relations with the U.S.
                        It was evident also that, as a result of the new drive for “peaceful
                        co-existence”, the <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0450"/>Soviets are
                        using Poland and Yugoslavia as a “front” for many of their own
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Dutch sent a strong Delegation headed by their Foreign Minister,
                            Luns.<note n="9" xml:id="d161fn9">J. Luns, Minister for Foreign Affairs,

                        and “a more equal sharing of the world’s supplies”. While his
                        share-the-wealth philosophy made a strong appeal to the less-developed
                        countries, it seems to be quite at variance with the very conservative
                        financial policy pursued by the Dutch Government.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian Delegation seemed to be playing a political game in that they
                        took a lead in protecting the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat
                        against the firmer control by the Council to which I have previously
                        referred above. Their representative, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MKRA1"

                        the Party line, was sharply critical of my address on the World Economic
                        Situation, on the ground that the gap between American living standards and
                        those of the rest of the world would create “mental and social isolation”
                        for the United States.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>In the absence of a constructive alternative, it is likely that the General
                        Assembly will vote to establish <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>
                        and that the U.S. will be isolated in opposition. From preliminary
                        indications, many of the Western European countries, the Soviet Bloc, and
                        practically all the underdeveloped countries will vote for <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. Even the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >U.K.</gloss> is presently considering only an abstention and appears to
                        be prepared to participate in drafting the Charter of <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> were formally established, it
                        would almost certainly have great difficulty in securing contributions.
                        However, the U.S. would be subjected to continuing and increasing pressures
                        to contribute. If <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> should begin
                        operations with the meager funds it might receive initially from France, the
                        Netherlands, some Scandinavian countries, and the Soviet Bloc, the pressure
                        for the U.S. to participate might become very difficult to resist.</p>
                    <p>In the attached position paper a counter-proposal is put forward for a
                        substantial enlargement of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Technical
                        Assistance program to permit concentrated work in basic fields such as
                        surveys of natural resources, technological institutes, and industrial
                        research and productivity centers. The U.S. would state its willingness to
                        support a doubling or tripling of the <gloss target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss>
                        fund, now at an annual level of <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0452"/>$30
                        million, it being understood that the U.S. percentage contribution would
                        within the next 3 years be reduced to 33⅓%. The details and the rationale of
                        the proposal are spelled out in the attached position paper (Tab A).</p>
                    <p>It is not unreasonable to believe that a U.S. initiative along these lines
                        might carry. However, whether or not it defeats the anticipated <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> resolution, the proposal can stand on
                        its own feet. The <gloss target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> is doing a useful
                        job well but it is strapped for funds. Its present $30 million annual level
                        compares with annual appropriations for the U.S. bilateral technical
                        assistance program of $125–$135 million. Moreover, the counter-proposal
                        offers a practical and constructive way to promote economic development
                        through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery; it has the advantage
                        over bilateral technical assistance that it enables us to tap experts from
                        other countries; it offers a basis for eliciting contributions from other
                        developed countries for an important U.S. objective; its dimensions are
                        realistic in terms of what other countries can afford and what the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can competently handle; and the job can be
                        undertaken within the framework of existing <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> machinery. Moreover, the response of other countries will
                        give a telling indication of how much financial support there is for further
                        development activity through the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>If countries respond to the U.S. initiative, the U.S. contribution would have
                        to rise over the next several years from the present level of $15.5 million
                        to perhaps as much as $33.3 million.</p>
                    <p>If you approve this counterproposal in principle, we will seek the
                        concurrence of the White House and the Bureau of the Budget and will consult
                        with key members of the Congressional authorizing and appropriations
                        committees.</p>

                            <item>The U.S. delegation should state the U.S. position on <gloss
                                    target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> firmly and forcefully so as
                                to leave no doubt where we stand: (a) The U.S. is fully alive to the
                                needs of the less developed countries for external assistance; this
                                is amply demonstrated by the record of U.S. aid for more than a
                                decade, (b) However, the U.S. is not prepared to support the
                                establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> at this
                                time; will vote against any resolution authorizing its present
                                establishment; and will not participate in any preparatory
                                commission to set up <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. The
                                resources which <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> could now
                                command would be totally inadequate to permit it to do the job
                                intended for it. If established now, <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                                    >SUNFED</gloss> would be structure without substance; it would
                                raise hopes that could not be fulfilled; its limited resources would
                                be dissipated among minor capital projects all over the world
                                without real impact on the development process anywhere, (c) The
                                U.S. stands by the pledge contained in General Assembly resolution

                                internationally-supervised disarmament, to join with others in
                                devoting a portion of the savings from such disarmament to an
                                international fund, within the frame-work of the United Nations, for
                                economic development. Only such disarmament will make possible

                                preventing such disarmament rests squarely with the USSR which has

                                maintaining the momentum of its present activities within the
                                existing scope of the program, and (b) to enlarge the scope of its
                                activities to permit systematic and sustained work in certain basic
                                pre-investment fields, such as intensive surveys of water, power and

                                governments would be willing to contribute to the enlarged <gloss

                                fund from their increased contributions; (d) to prepare the
                                necessary amendments to the present <gloss target="#t_UNTA1"
                                    >UNTA</gloss> legislation and procedure. The resolution should
                                also request governments to assist the preparatory committee in its
                                work and specifically to indicate the <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425"
                                    facs="0455"/>extent to which they would be willing to increase
                                their contributions to enable the program to expand. It should
                                invite the specialized agencies, the UNTAA, and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_TAB1">TAB</gloss> to provide their views and
                                suggestions to the preparatory committee through the
                                Secretary-General. The Committee would be requested to submit its
                                report and recommendations to the 26th session of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> (and through <gloss

                        </list>
                        <p>Several countries at <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> stated or
                            implied that the U.S. would be forced to participate once <gloss
                                target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> were established. It is
                            important, therefore, that the U.S. state its position on <gloss
                                target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> unambiguously so that countries
                            will not vote <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> into being on
                            the assumption that the U.S. will reluctantly go along.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, from present indications it is likely that, notwithstanding
                            the clearest statement of the U.S. position, a resolution to establish
                                <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> will carry unless a
                            positive and constructive alternative can be put forward.</p>
                        <p>The counter-proposal to enlarge the resources and scope of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> program may succeed in postponing a
                            showdown on <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> this year and
                            might even take some of the pressure off for the next few years while
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> fund was being built up.
                            Countries that would like to vote with the U.S. would find it easier to
                            turn down <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, and even some
                            diehard supporters of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> might be
                            prepared to settle, for the time being, for something that promised
                            additional resources even though the resources would not go into brick
                            and mortar projects.</p>
                        <p>However, whether or not the counter-proposal defeats <gloss
                                target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, it is a proposal that can stand
                            on its own feet. It offers a practical and constructive way to promote
                            economic development through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            machinery; it has the advantage over bilateral technical assistance that
                            it enables us to tap experts from other countries; it offers a basis for
                            eliciting contributions from other developed countries for an important
                            U.S. objective; its dimensions are realistic in terms of what other
                            countries can afford and what the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can
                            competently handle; and the job can be undertaken within the framework
                            of existing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery. Moreover, the
                            response of other countries will give a telling indication of how much
                            financial support there is for further development activity through the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Technical Assistance program is now
                            doing a useful job well. It is strapped for funds. The present level of
                            $30 million a year compares with U.S. annual appropriations for
                            bilateral technical assistance of $125–$135 million. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> tries to be responsive to reasonable
                            government requests over the whole range of economic <pb n="426"
                                xml:id="pg_426" facs="0456"/>and social activity. However, for lack
                            of funds, it can give its experts practically no logistic support, and
                            it has been quite unable to undertake survey, training, and
                            demonstration projects where these involve relatively large equipment
                            expenditures to be effective. Because it cannot commit too large a share
                            of its limited funds to continuing projects if it is to meet new
                            requests, it has been unable to give the sustained and systematic
                            support to going projects that they deserve.</p>
                        <p>While specific dollar figures should not be discussed with other
                            delegations in the absence of clear indications of the over-all extent
                            of financial support from other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Members, we would envisage a gradual buildup in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> fund of perhaps as high as $50
                            million to enable the program to maintain its present momentum and to
                            meet the needs of newcomers, and a target of perhaps as high as $50
                            million for the special projects fund. The special projects would be in
                            basic fields essential to growth, e.g. surveys of water, power, and
                            mineral resources; education, technological, vocational and basic
                            literacy; industrial research in the use of local materials;
                            agricultural research and demonstrations. While the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> operates in these fields in a
                            piecemeal way, the special projects fund would enable it to concentrate
                            in depth in these fields and to support projects that are more costly,
                            require more sustained assistance, and are more operational in nature.
                            Priority would be given to projects within the basic fields that would
                            have the widest impact, e.g. regional institutes and training facilities
                            of a permanent nature from which several neighboring countries could
                            benefit; surveys of water resources affecting several countries, e.g.
                            the Mekong River. Chapter III of the report of <gloss target="#t_TAB1"
                                >TAB</gloss> entitled “The Forward Look” suggests several areas
                            where more systematic research and training is needed as a foundation
                            for economic growth.</p>
                        <p>The fund would not do the job envisaged for <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                                >SUNFED</gloss>. It would not build bridges, dams, roads, power
                            plants, or houses; the capital required for that kind of job is
                            completely out of line with the resources countries are prepared to make
                            available. It would however do a job of significant and basic
                            importance. In less developed countries there is a shortage of
                            administrative, managerial and technical skills at every level. There is
                            little data on natural resources, and little or no experimentation on
                            new and productive ways to use the resources that are known. The
                            enlarged technical assistance program would help countries train their
                            manpower and assess and use their resources more productively.</p>
                        <p>Very few changes would need to be made in existing <gloss
                                target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss> machinery to support the larger
                            program. It might be advisable to appoint a Special Projects Director
                            who would work together with a technical committee of the <gloss
                                target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> to review projects and evaluate <pb
                                n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0457"/>them. Project proposals could
                            be submitted by governments, by specialized agencies and the UNTAA, and
                            by the <gloss target="#t_TAB1">TAB</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_TAC1"
                                >TAC</gloss> would review and approve the specific projects.</p>
                        <p>In presenting its counter-proposal, the U.S. delegation could elaborate
                            U.S. views on organization, basic fields, and criteria for selection as
                            set forth in this section, while recognizing that the full analysis and
                            study of these questions would be a matter for the preparatory committee
                            and the final decisions a matter for agreement among governments at the
                            General Assembly.</p>

                            discussed the issue for over an hour with a member of the international
                            staff in Treasury and it became quite clear that what has happened is

                            office a few days ago. While this letter is not as categorical in its
                            opposition to our project it raises very serious reservations.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In the light of these developments I have cancelled my trip to New York on
                        Monday (a) because it would not be proper for me to talk in any way about
                        our proposal in New York, even in the most guarded form, as long as the
                        project is in the present uncertain state; and (b) because it is evident
                        that a great deal still has to be done here in Washington and done
                        quickly.</p>
                    <p>Before proceeding with the discussion of the next steps which I believe ought
                        now to be taken, I have got two items of better news: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>I was called by Mr. <persName>Palmer</persName>, who works under
                                Bob Macy,<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5"><persName>Robert M.
                                        Macy</persName>, Chief of the International Division, Bureau
                                    of the Budget.</note> to furnish additional information on our
                                counter-proposal. In a telephone conversation lasting for over 1½
                                hours, I believe I was able to satisfy Palmer regarding the
                                soundness of the proposal. Mr. Palmer was particularly concerned
                                with the type of machinery which would be required to administer the
                                special projects fund. I told him that while we did not have that
                                part of the proposal clarified in all details, we fully expected
                                that it would be possible to use largely existing machinery and to
                                make the necessary arrangements with the Economic Department of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Headquarters of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to obtain the necessary
                                expert consideration of proposed projects before they are acted upon
                                by an intergovernmental body such as <gloss target="#t_TAC1"
                                    >TAC</gloss>. It became quite clear to me in the course of the
                                conversation that, as far as those who have so far dealt with this
                                question in the Bureau of the Budget are concerned, we can count on
                                support of the Bureau. Palmer is apparently working on a paper to be
                                submitted to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1"

                            <item>I discussed the counter-proposal in a long luncheon meeting at the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> with Mr. <persName>Richard
                                    Demuth</persName>, Director of the Technical Assistance and
                                Liaison Staff, and Mr. <persName>Davidson</persName> Sommers,
                                Vice-President and General Counsel. I was very much encouraged both
                                by their interest and sympathetic approach. They definitely feel
                                that our counter-proposal has real merit and would be useful also to
                                the operation of the Bank. They too, however, are concerned over the
                                question of machinery. Without committing themselves fully they
                                agreed that we should use <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                machinery. At the same time, they suggested that it might be
                                necessary, in order to make appropriate expert advice available, to
                                increase the staff of the Bank which they thought “could be
                                done”.</item>

                    <p>In the light of all that has gone before, it is evident that while there is
                        considerable support for the counter-proposal we are up against a real
                        problem with the Treasury and to a lesser degree with <pb n="429"
                            xml:id="pg_429" facs="0459"/>the Department of Agriculture. Considering
                        that there is literally not a day to lose if we are to be effective in New
                        York, I feel convinced that an all out effort will have to be made within
                        the next few days unless the ship is to flounder on the rocks of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG2">Humphrey</persName> school of thinking in the

                                    <item>The special projects proposal appears to stem from the May

                                        received from the relatively few governments which responded
                                        to the Secretary General’s request for comments on the
                                        report leave room for doubt whether even a build-up to $50

                                        indicate, furthermore, that little support could be expected
                                        for the suggested expansion of the program into the special
                                        projects area. Certain governments in fact questioned the

                        the proposed Special Projects Fund within the United Nations Technical

                        projects, which, for their implementation, would call for immediate large
                        capital investments and thus potentially increase pressures for the early

                        <p>The consultations requested by the Secretary on October 1 were carried
                            on, orally and by letter, by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"

                        <p>Both within the Executive Branch and in Congress the reception was
                            favorable. There was almost general agreement that the Technical
                            Assistance Program of the United Nations was useful and should be
                            increased and strengthened.</p>
                        <p>It was held that in contrast with <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                                >SUNFED</gloss>, the U.S. counter-proposal was economically sound in
                            centering on a limited number of projects designed to meet basic needs
                            of the under-developed countries (such as the promotion of broadly-based
                            technical training facilities; surveys of natural resources, including
                            water, power, and minerals, etc.). It was recognized that progress in
                            these fields, without eliminating the need for public financing, both
                            national and international, would facilitate the international flow of
                            private capital.</p>
                        <p>There was strong feeling that, apart from the economic merits of the
                            proposal, it was responsive to political necessity and helpful in
                            counteracting Soviet political and economic penetration of the
                            under-developed countries. These political considerations outweighed any
                            reluctance to provide additional U.S. funds to a multilateral program of
                            assistance. The hope was expressed that the need for additional U.S.
                            funds (from the present $15½ million to a maximum of $33⅓ million) would
                            develop slowly, and that the funds might be found in Fiscal 1959 and the
                            following years by a shift in existing U.S. aid programs, thus without
                            putting an additional burden on the U.S. taxpayer.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the consultations, the proposed position paper,<note

                            clarified. Specifically, and in response to a request by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, it was made clear
                            that the Special Projects Fund within the United Nations Technical

                        <p>Misgivings were expressed, in a few instances, about the lack of adequate

                            contemplated in the U.S. proposal. Agreement was reached in the
                            Department and other parts of the Government that existing technical
                            assistance machinery in the U.N. would have to be improved, both in

                            and related problems before the General Assembly will be called upon to
                            give final approval at its 13th Session in 1958, there will be adequate
                            time to resolve this problem in consultation with other governments and

                                    avoid projects which would increase pressure for <gloss

                                    at least for the time being. In response to this view, fully
                                    shared by Mr. <persName>Dillon</persName>, a new paragraph was
                                    inserted in the original position paper, to read as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The special projects fund would not do the job envisaged for
                                        <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. It would not
                                    build bridges, dams, roads, power plants, or houses; the capital
                                    required for that kind of job is completely out of line with the
                                    resources countries are prepared to make available. Nor would
                                    the fund be used for blueprinting or engineering projects to
                                    prepare them for financing. The job it would do is the more
                                    basic one of helping countries in a sustained and systematic way
                                    to train their manpower and assess and use their resources more
                                    productively. In less developed countries there is a shortage of
                                    administrative, managerial and technical skills at every level.

                                    productive ways to use the resources that are known. The
                                    enlarged technical assistance program would attack these

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Black</persName>, of the International
                            Bank, who discussed the issue briefly with Mr.
                                <persName>Dillon</persName>, believes that the United States should
                            accept the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> proposal and
                            participate in it. He showed no interest in the U.S. counter-proposal.
                            He was especially critical of the personnel associated with the U.N.
                            Technical Assistance machinery. By contrast, Mr.
                                <persName>Davidson</persName> Sommers (United States), Vice
                            President and General Counsel, as well as Mr. <persName>Richard H.
                                Demuth</persName> (United States), Director, Technical Assistance
                            and Liaison Staff, expressed considerable interest. They felt that the
                            U.S. plan might be of real assistance to the activities of the
                            International Bank. They, too, however, were concerned over the weakness
                            of the present technical assistance machinery in the U.N., and hoped
                            that before the General Assembly session in 1958, an expert group could
                            be convened which would study the best ways of using the technical
                            resources of the United Nations Secretariat and of the International
                            Bank to bring to bear upon the formulation and administration of
                            eligible special projects the best possible expert advice.</p>

                    <p>The Sec. said on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> he would like to
                        approve of their voting for this resolution with the inclusion of language
                        to the following effect: (here he read from a paper.) Sec. said it seemed to
                        him if we made these two qualifications this might be the best way out of a
                        bad dilemma. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said it
                        was his frank judgment that we made a mistake if we did it at all. He
                        mentioned the mechanical ways that limited us. This was the first time we
                        had gone into a multilateral agreement based purely on the volume of money
                        we get in. The fellows in Congress who were wavering on foreign aid would be
                        a lot harder to hold. He mentioned also the Sputnik thing. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he was personally very
                        concerned about reciprocal trade and mutual aid from the standpoint of
                        Congress. <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0468"/>He mentioned his talk
                        with Kerr.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Presumably Senator <persName>Robert
                                S. Kerr</persName> (<gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss>–Okla.), member
                            of the Senate Finance Committee.</note><persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said he was trying to tell him we had to cut down
                        on some programs. Mention had been made of wiping out land reserve on soil.
                        Kerr had said if we were going to wipe out anything let us wipe out our
                        foreign commitments program. This is the kind of thing we would run into in
                        growing amounts. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said even
                        with the language the Sec. mentioned we would still be making a mistake.
                        That was his judgment.</p>
                    <p>Sec. said as far as Congress was concerned we have this advantage that
                            <persName corresp="#p_JW1">Walter Judd</persName> is there who will take
                        the rap. He was a powerful advocate. This was not going to involve any
                        commitment for quite a little while. From the standpoint of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it was good tactics. Whether it is good or
                        bad from Congress’ standpoint was difficult to judge. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said we had committed ourselves to
                        multilateral fund—$300 million looks pretty small. Sec. asked if <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> would feel happier if amount was
                        bigger. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he thought it
                        would be difficult to reach. He rehearsed what happened when we start
                        international funds—we put up our money at some point and everybody else
                        puts up an IOU. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said one of
                        the problems was we could not collect the capital. We are going to be pretty
                        hard pressed if we don’t put up our share on the same basis as the other
                        countries. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he had been
                        struggling with an alternative suggestion. Quite frankly, he said he had not
                        come up with anything that was reasonably sound.</p>
                    <p>Sec. said he probably would have to decide on this over the week end. It may
                        come up for debate on Monday. Sec. asked when <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> would be back. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName> said on Sunday. Sec. said he would probably call
                        him again and asked if <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> was
                        vetoing this thing. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he
                        was giving him his views. Sec. said it was still very much in the future.
                        Sec. said it was a matter of being on the shelf until the merits were
                        considered. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> mentioned a
                        small down payment from some countries. He said in the interest of the
                        situation in the Middle East we were willing to agree to cutbacks. Sec.
                        asked if we would mind too much if this happened. A said if we did actually
                        get into it we would be hard put to sell it to the country. Country is not
                        prepared. He mentioned banking safeguard and the possibility of bank
                        expansion. Sec. said he would sweat it out a little more. From <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>’s standpoint he saw the force.</p>
                    <p>A. said he was sorry he could not be more helpful.</p>

                        authorized our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation to try to seek a
                        substitute for the present <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>

                                >Gadel</gloss> 106, December 7, the Department of State authorized
                            the U.S. Delegation to support a compromise proposal on <gloss
                                target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, in view of the reluctance of
                            many representatives to accept the U.S. position without revision.
                            (Department of State, Central Files, 398.051/12–757) A general summary
                            of the negotiations leading to the compromise resolution is in <ref
                                target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note> which would approve <gloss

                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> development loan fund when there was
                        dependable evidence that contributions in generally usable currencies would
                        be available in amounts aggregating $500 million or $400 million per annum.
                        The resolution would further point out that this would in the case of some
                        countries, e.g., the US, require a shifting from bilateral assistance to
                        this fund and also that US participation would require Congressional
                        approval presumably on an annual basis.</p>
                    <p>I have, as I say, doubts that this is really a sound project, but as Sputnik
                        has taught us, we cannot safely avoid the propaganda aspects of what we do.
                        To be a minority of practically one on the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> resolution would be extremely bad at this juncture. The
                        course I have authorized is perhaps part of a price we have to pay for
                        lapses in other respects. As you know, something like this is ardently
                        supported by both <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and

                        factors involved, with respect to which I have perhaps a special
                        responsibility.</p>

                    <p>A much amended and much negotiated compromise resolution which U.S. and

                        the Economic Committee of the United Nations, and will undoubtedly be

                        compromise which certainly does not contain all the things we would like to

                        Considering that they command an overwhelming voting majority, I believe

                        controllable deferment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, coupled
                        with an immediate but realistic program of technical assistance
                        expansion—which was our original proposal.</p>
                    <p>I recognize that there are sections of this compromise text which appear to
                        make it possible to set up at this time machinery along the lines previously
                        proposed for <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, and with an easy
                        transformability into <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. I do not
                        believe that there is the remotest likelihood of this happening under
                        present circumstances; and, indeed, we intend to make certain that it does
                        not happen by playing a leading role in the Preparatory Committee which will
                        chart the manner in which the new Special Fund for technical assistance will
                        be established and integrated with the present programs.</p>
                    <p>We shall welcome the participation in this enterprise of representatives of
                        the Treasury.</p>
                    <p>The measure of success of this resolution, of course, will be in how it works
                        out. I think it will work out reasonably well. If, however, it does not, we
                        are still fully protected by having made no commitment to participate, and
                        by having made perfectly clear that any participation on our part would be
                        only in accordance with <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0471"/>certain
                        specific understandings including the necessity of Congressional approval.

                        categorically untrue. Fact is US starting from position where seventy
                        countries favored immediate establishment <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> has induced them to completely reverse field to approve

                        development fund.</p>
                    <p>Convinced that resolution represents nine to one US victory and should be
                        played up as such: First—re-established US leadership in <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in economic field. Second—demonstrated great
                        benefits of splendid <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> cooperation.
                        Third—inaugurated new fund to meet important needs under defined
                        limitations. Fourth—put <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> in cold
                        storage.</p>
                    <p>What can be wrong about outcome that gives more sound aid to underdeveloped
                        countries, gives US more control, more good will and leadership and no

                    <p>In his closing statement to the Assembly, President <persName

                        Fund first among the major achievements of this session. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> said: “With the support and
                        cooperation of member governments, this new measure can be expected to make
                        a real contribution towards raising the levels of living in the less
                        developed countries of the world.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold, speaking to the press December 16, on the
                        accomplishments of the Assembly, said: “I would highlight, first of all, the
                        special projects fund decision, which opens new possibilities for the
                        development of economic assistance in forms which are not open to all those
                        various political objections which we know only too well. It may have opened
                        the door to a much more active contribution both of the United Nations
                        itself and of Member Governments. With the very keen sense of the importance
                        of this problem which you know I have, I of course regard this as a major
                        achievement. I may remind you of the fact that the United States
                        representative, in commenting upon it, used the word ‘milestone’, which is a
                        very strong word, and I for one would agree with him.”</p>

                        result was a unanimous resolution approving the U.S. proposal for enlarging
                        the scope of United Nations technical assistance programs and accepting the
                        U.S. view that neither <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> nor any

                        practicable until sufficient financial resources are prospectively available
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. As Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_JW1">Judd</persName> said, the underdeveloped countries
                        “will admit there is no chance of sufficient prospects until the U.S. and
                        other industrial countries are willing to contribute for such purpose. This
                        gives us practically complete control over the time and conditions where
                        such a fund could be established.”</p>

                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_JW1">Judd</persName> came to the General
                        Assembly skeptical of the United Nations Expanded Program of Technical
                        Assistance and with the conviction that the U.S. percentage contribution
                        should decline to 33⅓% as quickly as possible. After studying the problem
                        here, however, he became convinced that the new Special Fund proposed by the
                        U.S. was so sound in terms of U.S. objectives and the welfare of the less
                        developed countries that he announced publicly his intention to ask the U.S.
                        Congress to stabilize the percentage ceiling of the U.S. contribution at
                        40%, at least for several years. This assurance by Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JW1">Judd</persName> was one of the most important factors
                        in convincing other delegations that the U.S. was sincere in its proposal.

                        >Judd</persName>’s own evident sincerity. His role in obtaining Washington
                        concurrence to such changes as were required for negotiations was of equal
                        importance. In fact, it is hard to see how this excellent result could have
                        been achieved without his help.</p>

                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> listed the new program as one of the
                        four major accomplishments of the 12th General Assembly from a U.S.
                        standpoint. He observed that the new program “provides a new way to
                        strengthen underdeveloped countries against subversion from abroad. It could
                        greatly improve prospects for solving big political problems. It creates and
                        will create new good will for the United States.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s statement was more
                        prophetic than he realized. On December 17 the United Nations Secretary
                        General told him that the Egyptian Foreign Minister <persName

                                corresp="#p_FM1">Mahmoud Fawzi</persName>.</note> planned to request
                        technical assistance from the new Special Fund to help set up a central bank
                        which would serve the proposed Arab Economic Union. Mr.
                            <persName>Hammarskjold</persName> expressed the hope that this could be
                        done. He thought it is a job which the Fund could do very well and which the
                        Arabs could not possibly do by themselves. He also believed that this might
                        be the beginning of something which could radically change the Arab approach
                        to major questions, and that it could lead to greater Arab unity in the
                        political field, possibly culminating in a regional organization. <persName

                        on the Fund and said it expressed exactly what <persName corresp="#p_FM1"

                        Committee already had before it a draft resolution to establish a fund for
                        financing the economic development of the underdeveloped countries. This was
                        draft resolution L/331,<note n="8" xml:id="d169fn8">Draft resolution <gloss

                        Venezuela and Yugoslavia. Though not called <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>, the fund envisaged therein was in fact that foreseen by
                        the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> supporters during six years of
                        debate in the General Assembly. At the time L/331 was presented it was
                        estimated that more than 70 of the 82 delegations supported it. The position
                        of its co-sponsors was strengthened by the fact that the Economic and Social
                        Council in Resolution 662B (XXIV) had recommended that the 12th General
                        Assembly establish <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The immediate reaction of the 11 sponsors to the U.S. proposal was that it
                        was an attempt to sidetrack <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. They
                        argued at great length that the U.S. proposal should be tabled under Item 29
                        (Technical Assistance) and not under Item 28 (Economic Development of
                        Underdeveloped Countries). If the U.S. insisted on presenting its proposal
                        under Item 28, they contended, it could do so only by making its proposal a
                        part of a general fund which would go on to the financing of economic
                        development.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. Delegation refused both of these suggestions. It made it clear that
                        the U.S. proposal was neither a part of the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> idea nor a substitute for <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>, but a program which stood on its own merits and which
                        could make a constructive contribution to economic development. Moreover,
                        although theoretically there was no incompatibility between the two
                        proposals, in practice the Committee would have to make a choice between
                        them or neither could operate effectively. Since it was clear that there
                        were not sufficient resources available to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> for a capital fund for financing economic development, the
                        only wise and realistic course was to concentrate available resources on the
                        program suggested by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The 11 co-sponsors saw the logic of the U.S. position. On the other hand,
                        they had behind them six years of campaigning for <pb n="446"
                            xml:id="pg_446" facs="0476"/><gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>.
                        Obviously it was difficult for them to drop <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> altogether, at least openly. As a compromise, a
                        resolution was worked out which was essentially the U.S. program, with just
                        enough reference to the financing of economic development to save face for
                        those who had for so long supported <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss>. This made possible a resolution that could receive
                        unanimous support<note n="9" xml:id="d169fn9">Draft resolution <gloss
                                target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/C.2/L.331/Rev. 1.</note> (20 copies
                        enclosed). The U.S., France and Canada then joined the 11 co-sponsors of the
                        original draft resolution L/331 in presenting the compromise resolution to
                        the Committee.</p>
                    <p>The principal substantive change from the program originally set forth in
                        U.S. draft resolution L/354 was the recognition of the separate identity of
                        the new Special Fund. Initially the U.S. proposal would have placed the
                        Special Fund within the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance. In the
                        resolution as adopted, the Special Fund is conceived as an expansion of
                        existing technical assistance and development activities of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the specialized agencies. The U.S.
                        Delegation agreed to this change, which was urged not only by the
                        underdeveloped countries, but also by such <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> allies as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, Canada,
                        the Scandinavian countries and France. The latter argued that the new type
                        of project envisaged should not come under the Technical Assistance Board
                        and its Chairman, <persName>David Owen</persName>, nor should the new
                        program include such features of the Expanded Program as country targets and
                        specialized agency percentages. After studying the question, the delegation
                        came to the conclusion that such separate identity would also be preferable
                        in terms of U.S. objectives. At the same time the delegation was careful to
                        insist on language making it clear that the new Fund would be integrally
                        related to the Expanded Technical Assistance Program and that a minimum of
                        new machinery would be established.</p>
                    <p>The face-saving features of the compromise resolution were two references to
                            <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> in the Preamble, the inclusion
                        of part of the Annex from the original resolution L/331, and Section C. The
                        preambular references did nothing but recall previous resolutions of the
                        General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. The Annex was not
                        specifically voted on, was not binding and was referred to in such a way as
                        to give it no more standing than the views of any government. Section C
                        reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“<hi rend="italic">Decides</hi> that as and when the resources
                                prospectively available are considered by the General Assembly to be

                                principally the development of the economic and social
                                infrastructure of the less developed countries, the General Assembly
                                shall review the scope and future activities of the Fund and take
                                such action as it may deem appropriate.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0477"/>
                    <p>The U.S. had originally proposed that adequate resources be defined in
                        Section C as from $400 to $500 million in addition to those devoted to
                        technical assistance. The 11 co-sponsors considered this figure too high and
                        would have preferred $250 million. Consequently no figure was mentioned. To
                        make the U.S. position clear, however, Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_JW1">Judd</persName> explicitly mentioned the figure of
                        $400–$500 million in his statement to the General Assembly on December

                    <p>In addition to the U.S. intervention, statements by the Soviet bloc and other

                        representative, bluntly accused the U.S. of having shelved <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> by exerting pressure for the adoption
                        of its own proposal. Speaking of the resolution just after it was adopted
                        unanimously by the General Assembly on December 14 Mr.
                            <persName>Arkadev</persName> said: “The Soviet Delegation considers that
                        this resolution constitutes to some extent an expression of an attempt to
                        replace <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> by a broader concept of
                        the technical assistance fund—in other words, to prevent the establishment
                        of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>. The fact that the
                        establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> is being
                        postponed until some time in the future was confirmed in the statements of a
                        number of representatives in the Committee.”</p>
                    <p>The previous day, explaining his vote on the same resolution in the 2nd
                        Committee, Mr. <persName>Arkadev</persName> said it was clear that the
                        establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> as contemplated
                        by the underdeveloped countries was postponed indefinitely, despite the
                        explicit recommendation of the Economic and Social Council in resolution
                        662B (XXIV). He agreed with the representative of Iraq that the principal
                        effect of the resolution that had been unanimously approved would be to
                        remove the question of the establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> from the Agenda of future sessions of the Committee,
                        “undoubtedly to the great satisfaction of certain delegations.” Mr.
                            <persName>Arkadev</persName> made it plain that he was unhappy not only
                        about this feature of the resolution, but also about the provisions limiting
                        the fund’s activities to technical assistance, and the first paragraph in
                        the Annex of the resolution providing that contributions should be in
                        generally usable currencies. The <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0478"
                        />reason he gave for voting in favor of the resolution as a whole, while
                        abstaining on those parts he considered objectionable, was that the
                        underdeveloped countries appeared to want it. A more likely explanation is
                        the desire of the Soviet Union not to be excluded from the Preparatory
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>The feelings of the Soviet bloc about the resolution were also made plain by
                        the representatives of Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria at the 510th meeting of
                        the 2nd Committee held on December 13. The Czechoslovakian representative
                        said: “Mr. <persName>Chairman</persName>, the struggle for the establishment
                        of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> carried on for years by the
                        underdeveloped countries and their supporters has resulted yesterday in its
                        first phase in the adoption of a resolution which is far from being a
                        victorious successful or satisfactory outcome of the long negotiations. The
                        general feeling is that the losses suffered are heavy ones. Actually we have
                        seen <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> throughout the last phase of
                        its negotiations in such agony that there may be doubts as to its actual
                        survival if a more energetic action is not taken in the near future. He said
                        in the general debate on this subject that we would vote for any resolution
                        which would make for the drafting of a statute by the Preparatory
                        Commission, the establishment and the early start of the operations of
                            <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“The resolution adopted yesterday is too remote from any such scheme, it is a
                        kind of compromise which nearly kills the main idea so that the feeling of
                        frustration here and in the world may be deep and general. The present very
                        weak, very attenuating scheme is obviously the result of the heavy pressure
                        of the United States aimed at watering down of all better ideas and hopes in
                        this respect.”</p>
                    <p>The Bulgarian representative said: “With great attention I listened yesterday
                        to the statement of the distinguished representative of the United States in
                        which he stated that he was fully aware of the hard plight of the less
                        developed countries and that it was necessary to render them serious aid.
                        Following the rules of logic, I expected him to make a wider, larger
                        concession from the original U.S. attitude but I was disappointed when he
                        insistently demanded such an editing of the resolution which would leave
                            <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> aside for the time being and
                        under which the aid would be confined to technical assistance and technical
                        development only.”</p>
                    <p>Full transcripts of these statements have been sent to the Department and
                        copies are being retained by the Mission. The transcript of the Soviet
                        statement, in particular, may be useful in the Preparatory Committee if the
                        Soviets or other delegations attempt to change the character of the
                        Fund.</p>
                    <p>India and Yugoslavia, who with the Netherlands represented the leadership of
                        the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> group made it clear to the 2nd
                        Committee <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0479"/>that they were not very
                        happy about the resolution of which they become co-sponsors. That they
                        finally accepted what was essentially the U.S. proposal was evidently due to
                        two factors: (1) they wanted to bring the U.S. along on any further <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> program and feared that rejection of our
                        proposal would make any later attempt more difficult; (2) there was a steady
                        and very appreciable defection of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>
                        supporters to the U.S. proposal during the final three weeks before adoption
                        of the resolution. This was due to some extent to the efforts of the U.S.
                        Delegation in making individual contacts with almost all delegations outside
                        the Soviet bloc for the purpose of discussing in detail the essentials of
                        the U.S. position. The most important defections were those of the
                        Scandinavian countries and France, leaving the Netherlands as the only
                        potential contributor which had not gone over to the U.S. proposal. In the
                        case of France, at least, this change of position was aided materially by
                        efforts in Washington and Paris, supplementing those made with the French
                        Delegation here.</p>
                    <p>Speaking in the 2nd Committee at its 510th meeting on December 13, Ambassador
                            Jung<note n="12" xml:id="d169fn12">Ali Yavar Jung, Indian Ambassador to
                            Egypt.</note> of India expressed his disappointment that some
                        delegations which had originally supported the 11-Power draft resolution had
                        “unexpectedly” declared themselves in favor of the U.S. proposal. Though Mr.
                            <persName>Jung</persName> did not say so, it was evident that the long
                        series of statements not only by potential contributors but by the less
                        developed countries themselves in favor of the U.S. proposal had an
                        important effect in persuading the 11 Powers which had originally proposed
                        the capital development fund to accept a compromise resolution which was
                        essentially the U.S. proposal.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Brilej (Yugoslavia) also expressed some misgivings about the
                        resolution which he had co-sponsored. Mr. <persName>Brilej</persName>
                        acknowledged to the Committee that the resolution was not a further step
                        towards the financing of economic development; nevertheless, it represented
                        a step forward in that it had been adopted unanimously and contained certain
                        positive features. Similar regrets that the establishment of a capital
                        development fund had been postponed were expressed in the 2nd Committee’s
                        510th meeting by the representatives of Sudan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Preparatory Committee</hi></p>
                    <p>The final negotiation with the 11-Power group was over the composition of the
                        Preparatory Committee. The U.S. proposed that Ambassador Mir Khan of
                        Pakistan, now President of the Economic and Social Council, be named as
                        Chairman. Ambassador Jung, the <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0480"
                        />Indian representative, strongly opposed this on procedural grounds, while
                        saying he had no objection to Mir Khan personally, if Pakistan became a
                        member of the Preparatory Committee and if the Committee decided to elect
                        him. As a compromise, the U.S. agreed that Pakistan would become a member of
                        the Committee and that the Chairman would be elected when the Committee
                        met.</p>
                    <p>The Committee will include the following countries: U.S., <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, France, USSR, Netherlands, Denmark,
                        Canada, Japan, India, Egypt, Pakistan, Ghana, Mexico, Peru, Chile and
                        Yugoslavia.</p>
                    <p>The Indians attempted to enlarge the Committee further to include Poland and
                        Ceylon, but this attempt was successfully resisted by the U.S., aided by
                        Canada, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France. As constituted,
                        the Committee appears to be reasonably balanced from the standpoint of
                        getting a sympathetic approach to U.S. proposals and objectives. Also, if
                        Mir Khan can be made available, there would seem to be a good chance for the
                        U.S. through informal consultations to ensure majority support for him as
                        Chairman. This would be important from the standpoint of keeping the
                        Committee within the limits outlined for the Fund as interpreted by the U.S.
                        and other major contributing countries. For this purpose it would appear
                        advisable for the U.S. to consult fully in advance with friendly members of
                        the Committee. It would also appear advisable to have on hand the
                        transcripts of significant statements made in the meetings of December 12,
                        13 and 14 at which the resolution was discussed. These precautions should
                        all be useful in keeping the new Fund on the rails and seeing that it
                        develops in line with U.S. objectives.</p>

                    <p>Interest in air transport agreements which the US has with other countries
                        and in contemplated aviation negotiations has been heightened by the
                        investigation of the Smathers subcommittee of the Senate Committee on
                        Interstate and Foreign Commerce. A history of US international aviation
                        operations and the factors leading to our present policy has been presented
                        to the subcommittee along with a complete report on bilateral agreements.
                        This information is summarized here as of possible value to the missions
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>At this time the US is faced with numerous problems in the international
                        aviation field, stemming primarily from increasingly restrictionist
                        tendencies on the part of many other countries which wish to promote their
                        own aviation interests. These problems take the form of requests for
                        consultation under current agreements by countries which want additional
                        services for their carriers to the US or which want to limit the services of
                        US airlines to their countries. Some countries which do not have agreements
                        with us are pressing for negotiations looking toward an agreement as they
                        want to inaugurate services to the US or to obtain a more permanent
                        arrangement if operations are now being carried on under special permits. In
                        addition, there are indications that the Soviet Union has changed its long
                        established policy of excluding all foreign scheduled air carriers from the
                        USSR. This, along with the post-Geneva posture of the USSR, has resulted in
                        a feeling on the part of some Western countries that the strict policy
                        regarding aviation operations of Iron Curtain countries into the West should
                        be relaxed. Other problems have to do with an increasing number of new
                        regulations and taxes <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0482"/>which a
                        number of countries are inaugurating against foreign air-lines.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Background</hi> Until 1935 if an American airline wished to
                        operate abroad it applied directly to the governments of the countries into
                        and through which it intended to operate for whatever permits might be
                        required. In 1929 the US exchanged notes with Colombia, which provided
                        generally for air transport rights at Atlantic and Pacific coast ports of
                        the two countries for their airlines. By 1935 the desire of the airlines of
                        other countries for reciprocal permission to operate into the US made it
                        necessary for the US Government to undertake negotiations with the
                        governments of other countries for approval of such services. The first
                        intergovernmental arrangement for operations on specific routes resulted
                        from a conference held in Washington in 1935 in which the US, <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Canada, and Ireland agreed on routes to be
                        operated across the Atlantic by the airlines of the US and the <gloss

                        arrangements where no reciprocal services were required.</p>
                    <p>The development of international civil aviation and particularly the
                        technical developments which took place between 1939 and 1943 made it
                        apparent that air transport operations in the post-war period were going to
                        be conducted throughout the world and would require bilateral air transport
                        agreements between the governments of any two countries whose airlines
                        desired to operate between those two countries or through them. Accordingly,
                        on October 14, 1943 the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Department of State
                        issued a joint statement<note n="5" xml:id="d170fn5">For text, see
                            Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 16, 1943,
                            p. 265.</note> that the Department of State would undertake any
                        necessary international negotiations with regard to air transport operations
                        and setting forth the respective responsibilities of the two agencies and
                        the procedures to be followed. This statement was in line with the Civil
                        Aeronautics Act of 1938<note n="6" xml:id="d170fn6">For text of the Act,
                            enacted June 23, 1938, see 52 Stat. 973.</note> in which Congress
                        recognized the power of the President to enter into Executive Agreements
                        relating to civil aeronautics, including civil air transport services. The
                        statement sets forth the primary interest of the Department of State from
                        the standpoint of foreign policy and international relations, including the
                        broad economic effects of aviation in foreign countries. It points out that

                        countries, particularly the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                        prevented this. It was possible, however, to reach agreement at that time on
                        a standard form air transport agreement to be used as a model for bilateral
                        agreements. This form, which the US then used as a basis for its agreements,
                        provided for reciprocal grant of air transport rights to be described in an
                        annex, with each contracting party designating its airline or lines for
                        agreed routes and, in turn, granting appropriate operating permission to the
                        line or lines designated by the other contracting party. The agreement
                        specified that operations of the airlines would be subject to the normal
                        laws and regulations of the country entered with regard to entry and
                        departure of aircraft and operation of aircraft in the airspace of that
                        country, and to the customs and immigration laws.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as in the period immediately following the close of World War II the
                        airlines of few other countries were prepared to operate extensive
                        international air services, the initial negotiations in the immediate
                        post-war period were less difficult than those of later years. The
                        agreements concluded provided a basis for operation by US airlines. The
                        routes were those determined by the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>,
                        after thorough consideration, to be desirable to create an air transport
                        system to meet the needs of the US as provided by the Civil Aeronautics Act
                        of 1938. There were some countries, such as the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>, which were prepared to offer air service to the US and thus
                        take advantage of the reciprocity provided for in the standard agreement.
                        The difference in philosophies between the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> had made impossible agreement between those two countries as
                        to the type of air transport provisions that should be incorporated in the
                        Chicago Convention. Consequently, when in February 1946, the US and <gloss

                        transport agreement, it was apparent it would have to contain
                        compromises.</p>

                        nucleus of the negotiations and to it were added what have become known as
                        the Bermuda Principles. These have formed the basis of subsequent US air
                        transport agreements.</p>
                    <p>Prominent among these principles were those relating to the volume of service
                        to be offered by the airlines of the two countries. The British had, in the
                        first instance, desired to regulate the volume of service in order to
                        protect <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> airlines from overwhelming
                        competition by the already-strong US airlines. The US, on the other hand,
                        desired to establish freedom of operation in order that the natural effects
                        of competition might provide the public with the best possible air service
                        and at the same time provide for the healthy expansion and development of
                        the airlines providing this service. The result was a compromise with regard
                        to capacity provisions. The Bermuda agreement provided that there should be
                        fair and equal opportunity for the airlines of the contracting parties to
                        operate on any route established by the agreement and its annex. It further
                        provided that, in the operation by the airlines of either part of the trunk
                        services described in the agreement, the interest of the airlines of the
                        other party should be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly
                        the services which such airlines might provide on all or part of the same
                        route. It was stated that the services provided by the designated airlines
                        under the agreement should retain as their primary objective the provision
                        of capacity adequate to the traffic demands between the country of which the
                        airline is a national and the country of the ultimate destination of the
                        traffic. The right to embark or disembark on such services international
                        traffic destined for and coming from third countries at points on the
                        specified routes should be applied in accordance with general principles of
                        orderly development to which both parties subscribed and should be subject
                        to the general principles that capacity should be related to: a) traffic
                        requirements between the countries of origin and the countries of
                        destination; b) the requirements of through airline operations; and c) the
                        traffic requirements of the area through which the airline passes after
                        taking account of local and regional services.</p>
                    <p>The specification of these three principles concerning relation of capacity
                        to traffic requirements and requirements of through airline operations were
                        important to assure the British that US airlines would not operate services
                        for the primary purpose of carrying traffic from one point outside the US to
                        another point outside the <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0485"/>US
                        (so-called fifth freedom traffic). At the same time they were equally
                        important to assure the US that its airlines would have an opportunity to
                        carry such fifth freedom traffic on a reasonable basis since the long trunk
                        services of the US could not economically survive if they were to carry only
                        traffic originating in the US or destined thereto. On the other hand, it was
                        recognized that the trunk services should not force the local or regional
                        services out of business. It was acknowledged that on a long-haul service
                        the long- haul passenger would be given preference by the airline, with
                        schedules to suit his convenience as far as possible rather than that of a
                        local passenger. The natural balance of protection for local and regional
                        services continues to provide a way to allow healthy expansion of long trunk
                        services without jeopardy to local and regional services. The US, like every
                        country which has airlines operating extensive services, benefits doubly
                        from these provisions. It benefits by having an opportunity for its
                        long-haul services to develop soundly. It also benefits by having a
                        protection for its local and regional services against undue competition
                        from the long-haul services of other countries.</p>
                    <p>Another principle incorporated into the Bermuda Agreement dealt with rates.
                        The British had desired to regulate the rates to be charged by the airlines
                        of the two countries. The US felt the rates could be better decided by the
                        carriers themselves and that governments should not be in the rate-making
                        business. Moreover, under the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, US officials
                        did not have authority to prescribe rates either for US airlines operating
                        in international services or for foreign airlines operating into and through
                        the US. In this case also a compromise was achieved. The Bermuda Agreement
                        provided that rates should be subject to the approval of the parties within
                        their respective powers and obligations. It was noted that the US <gloss
                            target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> had announced its intention to approve the
                        rate conference machinery of the International Air Transport Association
                        (IATA). It was also understood that the rates concluded through <gloss
                            target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> would be subject to approval by the
                            <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> of the US. Provisions were included
                        for situations where <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> could not agree
                        on a rate, where <gloss target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> procedure was too
                        slow, or where parties withdrew from the <gloss target="#t_IATA1"
                            >IATA</gloss> machinery. As a general criterion it was stated that rates
                        should be fixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant
                        factors, such as cost of operation, reasonable profit and the rates charged
                        by other airlines.</p>
                    <p>The Bermuda Agreement specified in detail in an annex the routes to be
                        operated by the airlines of the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                        >UK</gloss>, setting forth the points of departure from the US, the
                        intermediate points, the points to be served in <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> territory and the points to be served beyond the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> territory. Similar specifications are set
                        forth for the <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0486"/>routes to be served
                        by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> airlines. Provisions were made for
                        route amendments that permitted alteration of the points served in the
                        territory of the other contracting party only after consultation between the
                        parties. Route changes could be made at any time with regard to the
                        intermediate points and the points beyond the territory of the other party,
                        but it was provided that prompt notice should be given in case of such
                        changes. If the other party found that the interest of its airlines were
                        prejudiced by the changes, it could request consultation and if the parties
                        could not agree to a solution of their problem, they had recourse to the
                        arbitration provisions of the agreement. This language has not been used in
                        all subsequent air transport agreements as it is useful only in cases where
                        intermediate and “points beyond” are specified and is not necessary when a
                        route is described in general terms.</p>
                    <p>The negotiation of the routes has been the most controversial problem in
                        negotiating all air transport agreements after the fundamental principles
                        have been established. US airlines, of course, wish to operate widely
                        throughout the world and to develop their services on as economic a basis as
                        possible while at the same time providing service from the US to as many
                        points and over as long trunk services as possible. The routes which the US
                        attempts to negotiate for operations by its lines are for the most part
                        routes which result from certification of US airlines after appropriate
                        proceedings before the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>. The US strives
                        to negotiate route exchanges which represent an equitable exchange of
                        economic benefits. In order to give due consideration to US airline
                        interests, the US has followed a policy of hearing the views of the
                        interested airlines before the beginning of negotiations of air transport
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>Through the years since the 1946 negotiation of the Bermuda Agreement, an
                        increasing number of airlines of other countries have begun international
                        operations. In many cases these operations are of a regional character and
                        the airlines performing the services are small and struggling. The countries
                        of which those airlines are nationals are acutely aware of the economic
                        struggles of their airlines and in many instances the governments are called
                        upon to give financial aid to the airlines in order to keep them flying.
                        Consequently these countries continue to look for means by which the
                        economic wellbeing of their carriers can be increased immediately. Many
                        times they feel that the increase in services by US trunk lines is
                        detrimental to the service by their regional carriers and so attempt to
                        apply restrictions to the services offered by US airlines.</p>

                        routes provided for in the bilateral agreements. Moreover, the US will be
                        attempting to implement the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>-approved
                        amendment in Pan American’s route to provide service from New York via Paris
                        and Rome to Istanbul and Ankara. We will also be attempting to negotiate the
                        rights for TWA approved by the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> in the
                        European route modification case. Some of these, as well as other route
                        requests, were discussed with the British in aviation talks last May and
                        remain as pending issues along with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>

                    <p>The Netherlands has been pressing the past few months for negotiations
                        looking toward a bilateral aviation agreement in order to put KLM’s
                        operations to the US on a more permanent basis. We have delayed negotiations
                        in order that they might take place at a more propitious time, but the Dutch
                        are showing increasing signs of displeasure at the delay. Belgium has
                        requested consultations to amend its bilateral in order that it might have
                        another stop in the US, preferably in the mid-west. We have replied that we
                        are ready to negotiate but there is little prospect for the request being
                        granted since there is no quid-pro-quo which the US wants in return. We are
                        now waiting to see if Belgium wants to undertake negotiations under those
                        circumstances. Austrian officials indicated last May that they might want to
                        negotiate with the US to conclude a permanent aviation agreement, rather
                        than the interim arrangement now in effect. We have discouraged a formal
                        approach as we do not consider this an auspicious time for such
                        negotiations. In Portugal, delivery of new aviation equipment will cause US
                        airlines to lose fifth freedom rights to South Africa since Portuguese lines
                        will now be able to carry this traffic. The Lisbon-South Africa route is not
                        contained in the air transport agreement with Portugal.</p>
                    <p>The Greek Government is attempting to find investors to take over the Greek
                        Airline TAE. This presents a problem with regard to US support of regional
                        airline operations as a means of meeting intensive competition from British
                        affiliated companies in the Middle East. Regionalism may well come up at the
                        second European Civil Aviation Conference which is scheduled for Strasbourg
                        in November and the US must prepare a position for this eventuality.</p>
                    <p>For some time there have been indications that the USSR has changed its
                        long-established policy of excluding all foreign scheduled air carriers,
                        satellite as well as non-curtain, from the USSR. Since January 1 of this
                        year the USSR reportedly has concluded bilateral air transport agreements
                        with all European satellites except East Germany and Albania. Each of these
                        reportedly authorizes the satellite carrier to establish service to Moscow
                        and we understand that such service has in fact been inaugurated by the
                        Czech and Polish airlines. In addition, the Soviets have approached Austria
                        concerning regular air service between Austria and the Soviet Union and
                        reportedly have invited Finland to open negotiations for a reciprocal
                        exchange of services between Helsinki and Moscow. A similar offer to Sweden
                        has been rumored but not confirmed. There have been indications on the part
                        of some Western European countries that they would like to see if they could
                        negotiate reciprocal arrangements with the USSR and other Eastern European
                            <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0492"/>countries and that it might be
                        well to relax the aviation policy we have toward those countries. The US is
                        studying this situation in conjunction with all east-west problems in light
                        of the Geneva conference.</p>
                    <p>In late July New Zealand presented us with a strong aide-mémoire challenging
                        Pan American’s right to a third flight in light of traffic needs. Statistics
                        in support of its request have been supplied by Pan American and a decision
                        must be made whether the airline’s operations are in line with the bilateral
                        agreement. In accordance with a Canadian request, the US will commence
                        aviation consultations in Washington September 19. The Canadians want to
                        discuss transborder problems and may request a reappraisal of existing
                        routes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Aviation Problems with Near East Countries</hi> The
                        thorniest aviation problem facing the US in the Near East concerns the
                        negotiation of an aviation agreement with India. That country, which is
                        extremely restrictionist in its aviation outlook, terminated the US-Indian
                        bilateral of 1946 effective last January. When negotiations last broke down,
                        an interim arrangement was agreed whereby US lines could operate to India on
                        a slightly reduced basis until January 15, 1956. It was understood that in
                        the meantime negotiations would take place looking toward a new agreement.
                        It is expected that US officials will go to New Delhi for this purpose,
                        possibly in October, and the US is now formulating its position.
                        Negotiations will be difficult as India has not relaxed its view that it
                        must be given the right to predetermine the capacity of US lines.</p>
                    <p>Pan American is desirous of filing for a fifth flight, through Karachi.
                        Indications are, however, that this would result in an impasse with Pakistan
                        over the interpretation of the air transport agreement and the US might be
                        in an aviation position with Pakistan similar to the one we have in India.
                        For that reason the Department has advised Pan American that we believe it
                        would be ill advised to file for the fifth flight under existing
                        circumstances and has referred the matter to <gloss target="#t_CAB1"

                    <p>The Government of Ceylon is anxious to conclude a bilateral aviation
                        agreement with the US. We have recommended to the <gloss target="#t_CAB1"
                            >CAB</gloss> that negotiations take place and are awaiting the Board’s
                        views. If the Dutch Airline KLM makes a deal in Ceylon to operate a
                        Ceylonese international airline, it may make it more difficult for us if the
                        negotiations are delayed.</p>
                    <p>The Department has solicited the views of the Civil Aeronautics Board
                        concerning proceeding with a negotiation with Iraq in an attempt to get a
                        Bermuda type aviation agreement and route description without Baghdad (at
                        which point the Iraqis will not grant regional fifth freedom rights). Our
                        chances of getting a Bermuda <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0493"/>type
                        agreement with Iraq are likely to diminish as Iraqi Airways is getting
                        Viscounts and may take a greater interest in Basra–Cairo traffic. Moreover,
                        the recent agreement Iraq negotiated with India is highly restrictive. On
                        the more positive side, it appears that it may be possible to reach
                        agreement with Iran on a bilateral and negotiating sessions are being
                        scheduled for October. The Department and <gloss target="#t_CAB1"
                            >CAB</gloss> have studied the Iranian draft and have authorized
                        alternative language if it is impossible to obtain Iranian agreement to the
                        language in the US draft.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, our Air Attaché in the Middle East notes increasing tendencies on
                        the part of local businessmen and airlines to attempt to diminish American
                        aviation influence in the area.</p>

                        interpretation of the air transport agreement with Japan has been a point at
                        issue, with Japan insisting on predetermination of frequencies. Formal
                        consultations with that country, which were scheduled for July, were
                        postponed until a more auspicious time without prejudice to the position of
                        either party in a future consultation. Meanwhile an interim arrangement was
                        agreed for an additional weekly frequency for Northwest Orient Airlines.
                        (See <ref target="#pg_11">page 11</ref>, July 5, 1955 issue.) While the

                        again.</p>
                    <p>There have been informal indications from Korean officials from time to time
                        that they would like to negotiate a bilateral aviation agreement with the
                        US. So far, we have been able to forestall any formal request on the basis
                        that an agreement should first be reached between the two countries on a
                        treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.</p>

                        carrier comments and formulation of a definite US negotiating position on
                        routes. We have also been consulting with Chilean officials regarding their

                        provide a West Coast route from Chile to the US. Chile considers that its
                        right to a West Coast route was recognized in 1947 and that its deferment
                        was solely on grounds of economic justification. The <gloss target="#t_CAB1"
                            >CAB</gloss> has requested a temporary delay in negotiations pending

                        route since the US does not desire any new routes to Chile and it was felt a
                        West Coast route for Chile would create an imbalance in the agreement. The
                        Haitians have requested negotiations looking toward an air transport

                        implications of the Civil Aeronautics Board decision in the Large Irregular
                        Air Carrier Investigation (Docket 5132 <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>.) as set
                        forth in Board Order No. <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>–9744, November 15,
                        1955.</p>
                    <p>The United States interest in the orderly development of international air
                        transportation is shared by many foreign governments. Most of these
                        governments attach special importance to questions of air transportation
                        between their respective countries and the United States, its territories
                        and possessions. These governments have their own policies regarding the
                        respective roles of scheduled and non-scheduled air carriers on
                        international routes. Over a period of time, a degree of international
                        understanding has been reached and a similarity of practices developed. For
                        instance, scheduled air services between two countries generally are
                        governed by a bilateral air transport agreement, which includes principles
                        for controlling fares, routes, and levels of service. A definition of a
                        scheduled international air service has been adopted by the Council of the
                        International Civil Aviation Organization (<gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                            >ICAO</gloss>) and accepted by most of the participating governments,
                        including the United States. Individual governments (including the United
                        States) require foreign carriers to <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0495"
                        />obtain permission for each commercial flight which is not provided under
                        an air transport agreement with the government of the carrier concerned.</p>
                    <p>The proposed Board policy differs from the policies of most foreign
                        governments in several material respects. In general, it would eliminate the
                        traditional requirement that irregular carriers provide irregular (i.e.,
                        non-scheduled) services. The most significant innovation is that which would
                        permit such carriers to provide a type of common-carriage scheduled air
                        cargo service. If supplemental United States carriers establish
                        international operations which foreign governments consider as scheduled
                        services within the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> definition, such
                        governments may insist that the operations be brought within the provisions
                        of the air transport agreements. A delicate situation already exists
                        regarding the levels of United States flag carrier services under air
                        transport agreements with many countries. It is the considered opinion of
                        this Department that efforts to obtain foreign approval for expanded
                        operations by supplemental carriers should not be made if such efforts would
                        have an adverse effect on essential services which should be operated in
                        furtherance of the national interest.</p>
                    <p>The probability of opposition to the expansion of United States supplemental
                        air carrier operations to foreign territories is increased by other factors
                        such as: the freedom of each supplemental carrier to undercut <gloss
                            target="#t_IATA1">IATA</gloss> (and each other’s) rates; Board approval,
                        under its 1955 Trans-Atlantic Charter Policy, of contract flights which are
                        not considered as bona fide charters by some foreign governments; a question
                        as to whether foreign operators could obtain from the Board permission to
                        establish supplemental service to the United States on a fully reciprocal
                        basis; and Board requirements for charter flight applications by foreign
                        operators more burdensome than those of foreign governments for similar
                        flights by United States operators. In addition, if more than a few of the
                        forty-nine applicants which Order <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>–9744 would
                        authorize to inaugurate supplemental service on an interim basis attempted
                        to obtain the necessary permission from other governments, a chaotic
                        situation might result.</p>
                    <p>It is urged that (except in respect of transportation between places in the
                        same territory or possession) Stay Order No. <gloss target="#t_E1"
                        >E</gloss>–9894 remain in effect until the Board reaches a final decision as
                        to the type of authorization to be granted and the individual applicants to
                        be given such authorization. The Department then will be able to appraise
                        more precisely the foreign relations implications and determine the extent,
                        if any, to which the Government should be prepared to press foreign
                        governments for approval of expanded <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0496"
                        />operations by United States supplemental carriers where such pressure
                        might impair United States air transport relations.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWE1"
                            >Harris</persName></hi>: In accordance with the request which was made
                        to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJP1">J. Paul Barringer</persName> of this
                        Department during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJP1">Barringer</persName>’s
                        appearance before the Subcommittee on Transportation and Communications on
                        January 18, 1956, in connection with hearings on civil air policy and
                        omnibus amendments (H.R. 4648 and H.R. 4677) to the Civil Aeronautics Act of
                        1938, as amended, the Department is pleased to offer its views on the
                        suggested list of items for Subcommittee consideration submitted to your
                        Subcommittee by Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Most of the subjects on the list concern matters within the primary
                        responsibilities of agencies or departments other than the Department of
                        State. The Department’s comments are restricted to those subjects (Items 1
                        and 6 of the list) which involve significant foreign relations aspects.</p>
                    <p>Item 1 pertains to an evaluation of present policy and laws. Since the
                        Department’s prepared statement of January 18, 1956 included views on United
                        States civil air policy as related to international aviation, it is believed
                        that that aspect of Item 1 has already been covered.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the adequacy of present laws, the Department believes that
                        experience under the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended, has
                        demonstrated that the Act in general provides an <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467"
                            facs="0497"/>adequate framework for the encouragement and development of
                        an air transportation system to meet the needs of the United States.</p>
                    <p>With appropriate amendments, such as the extension of Civil Aeronautics Board
                        power over fares, rates, rules and practices in foreign air transportation,
                        it is believed that there will be continued adequacy of laws to meet
                        foreseeable future needs.</p>
                    <p>Item 6 pertains to the growth, in the world market, of the United States air
                        transport industry. Although not in a position to compare such growth with
                        the rate of domestic growth as suggested in Item 6, the Department invites
                        the attention of the Subcommittee to the fact that United States flag
                        carriers occupy a prominent place in the world market via-à-vis the flag
                        carriers of other countries. The authority for United States airlines to
                        discharge or pick up revenue traffic in most areas of the world is obtained
                        by the United States Government through air transport agreements which the
                        United States negotiates with the governments of each of the foreign
                        countries involved. In order to obtain such rights, the United States must
                        be prepared to grant, as required, comparable rights in the United States
                        for services by the designated airline of the country concerned. Such was
                        the situation in the case of the negotiation of an air transport agreement
                        with Germany, to which reference was made in Item 6. It is the considered
                        opinion of the Civil Aeronautics Board, fully shared by the Department, that
                        the air transport agreement between the United States and Germany represents
                        an equitable exchange of economic benefits.</p>
                    <p>Since the enactment of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, the United States
                        has negotiated forty-six air transport agreements. Most of those which have
                        been concluded since 1946 reflect the principles embraced by the United
                        States and the United Kingdom in an agreement which was signed at Bermuda on
                        February 11, 1946. The principles and exchanges of traffic rights contained
                        in these agreements provided favorable conditions for expansion of
                        international operations by United States flag carriers. A continuation of
                        such conditions, so long as accompanied by the continuation of other
                        prevailing conditions such as a progressive aircraft manufacturing industry,
                        expanding levels of travel and trade, and airline efficiency stimulated by
                        reasonable competition, will assure the continued growth of United States
                        airlines in the world market.</p>
                    <p>In addition to views on the list of subjects submitted by Congressman
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boggs</persName>, you requested the
                        Department’s comments on the suggestion that there should be closer
                        collaboration between government and industry (particularly with reference
                        to the negotiation with Mexico) in the negotiation of bilateral air
                        transport agreements. Liaison with the carriers on air transport agreement
                        negotiations is maintained by the Civil Aeronautics Board. The <pb n="468"
                            xml:id="pg_468" facs="0498"/>Department attends meetings between the
                        Board and the carriers when such matters are discussed. The carriers’ views
                        thereafter are considered by the Department and the Board in establishing a
                        United States position for the negotiations. As a general practice, in
                        addition to making known its views regarding negotiation of a specific
                        agreement, the industry requests that a representative be placed on the
                        United States delegation. Unless overriding reasons exist, the
                        representative designated by the industry is attached to the United States
                        delegation as an observer. Since the interests of individual carriers often
                        are conflicting and irreconcilable, an official of the Air Transport
                        Association usually is designated as the industry observer. The Department
                        believes that existing procedures and practices, if fully utilized, provide
                        adequate opportunity for industry representation in the governmental
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>As stated at the hearing on January 18, 1956, it would be inadvisable to
                        comment at this time on air transport relations with Mexico. However, the
                        Department would be pleased to discuss this subject at the executive
                        session, which, it is understood, is to be held in the near future.</p>
                    <p>The opportunity to express the Department’s views on the above matters is
                        appreciated.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <item>Official US international air transport policy is based on the
                            “Bermuda Concept”, so named after the Agreement signed in 1946 by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US. This concept
                            represents something of a compromise between the traditional US policy
                            of advocating free and unfettered use and development of air routes
                            overseas, and the more restrictive or protective policy followed by many
                            European countries. Under the “Bermuda Concept” the US agreed to consult
                            with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> if it were felt by one of the
                            signatories that its aviation interests were being injured by the
                            activities of the others. It has set the pattern for subsequent air
                            agreements the US has signed with a number of other countries.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Misunderstandings and differences of opinion over the application of
                            this policy have not infrequently developed between the US air industry
                            and the US Government. In brief, the US industry, which has enjoyed
                            relatively free competition abroad, advocates a restrictive policy in
                            respect to domestic air traffic, and it has had considerable success in
                            influencing Congressional opinion in favor of such a restrictive policy.
                            Foreign airlines which are expanding rapidly are now ready and able in
                            many cases to increase their service in the United States. Foreign
                            governments whose airlines wish to have a greater share of the US market
                            are increasingly insistent that the US adopt a more liberal policy
                            domestically, and there have been numerous indications that they will
                            condition the grantings of privileges to US overseas airlines on the
                            granting of reciprocal privileges to their airlines in the US. Acute
                            problems have therefore been caused by the dualistic attitude of the US
                            industry. It is the Department’s view that unless the US industry
                            recognizes the intimate relationship between their opportunities for
                            expanding their overseas air service and their willingness to allow
                            foreign airlines to have additional routes in the US, US aviation
                            interests as well as US foreign policy objectives may suffer. The
                            primary object of the <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0500"/>proposed
                            meeting, then, is to reach some agreement on a consistent application of
                            US international air transport policy.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Reiber</persName> told me that he had little knowledge of the
                        trade agreements field and that he was seeking information which might be of
                        help to him in his work relating to international air transportation
                        agreements. He explained that the United States through executive agreements
                        trades landing rights in this country for similar privileges in other
                        countries. He thought that the United States was being placed more and more
                        in a defensive position on air agreements in that other countries were now
                        beginning to make demands upon us for additional privileges in many cities
                        while there was little they could give us in return. In particular he was
                        concerned about the Dutch and Belgian situations but implied there were
                        others as well.</p>
                    <p>After a short time, it became evident that what Mr.
                            <persName>Reiber</persName> was trying to do was to establish that we
                        were following dissimilar policies in negotiating air as opposed to trade
                        agreements. Thus, whereas the United States obtained reciprocity for trade
                        agreement concessions granted, we were not obtaining reciprocity in air
                        agreements. He kept repeating that the granting of landing privileges in New
                        York was worth far more to any foreigner than landing privileges the United
                        States might obtain in any other city in the world. He made clear, however,
                        that he recognized the necessity for a degree of imbalance because it would
                        be impossible for us to gain any rights if we did not grant New York.</p>
                    <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0501"/>
                    <p>I explained to Mr. <persName>Reiber</persName> that although I knew very
                        little about air agreements it seemed to me that there are significant
                        differences between them and trade agreements. I mentioned for example, my
                        understanding that what we try to get in air agreements is not only a
                        particular point in a country, but the use of that point as another part of
                        a network leading to the establishment of economic routes through which we
                        expand our air coverage of the world. Thus, obtaining Amsterdam from the
                        Dutch is not solely for the purpose of carrying traffic to that point but
                        also for servicing areas beyond. The situation was, therefore, very much
                        different from that in trade negotiations because any tariff concessions we
                        obtain are strictly applicable to the country from which they are obtained
                        and have no implications or very few, for trade through that country to a
                        third country. I also pointed out that it seemed as if in the air transport
                        field their interests were afforded much greater protection than say, for
                        example, the shipping interests. In the latter case, there are no
                        restrictions which would prevent foreign vessels from calling at any United
                        States ports. Therefore, through the device of air agreements limiting
                        foreign rights in the United States, the domestic air interests seem to be
                        highly favored in the transport field.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName>Reiber</persName> repeated his claim that KLM was
                        obtaining much greater revenue from its traffic on the Amsterdam route than
                        we were, I explained that it would only seem that the Dutch were more
                        efficiently exploiting the routes than United States carriers. So far as I
                        could see the granting of landing privileges was like having a hunting
                        license. One still had to bag the game. In this sense air and trade
                        agreements were similar; when we grant tariff concessions we do not grant
                        assurance of increased exports to this country. Such concessions only offer
                        the possibility of greater trade if a country can produce a commodity and
                        develop a market through competitive ability. To the extent that KLM was
                        carrying American passengers, which Mr. <persName>Reiber</persName> stated
                        to be eight out of every ten, the evidence seemed to indicate that the Dutch
                        were being competitive. Mr. <persName>Reiber</persName> concluded that there
                        appeared to be little similarity between trade and air transport agreements,
                        but he felt that he should be able to find some basic similarities to enable
                        him to argue that we were following inconsistent economic policies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Reiber</persName> also made the point that air agreements were
                        not based upon laws prescribing the procedures and standards upon which they
                        could be concluded and thought that legislation might be an answer. He
                        referred to the Smathers Bill which he said was not industry supported, but
                        which had passed the Senate at the last session and said that such
                        legislation made it imperative for the industry to take a stand. I explained
                        to him that while sometimes legislation might be useful, he should consider
                        the fact that frequently, <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0502"
                        />especially in an expanding field such as he is involved in, legislation
                        becomes outmoded very quickly. Instead of legislation granting protection to
                        their interests, it might very well become a straight jacket preventing
                        international negotiations of the type required in changed
                        circumstances.</p>

                            Talks</hi></p>
                    <p>The government-industry conference on problems of international relations in
                        the civil aviation field, held in the Department November 14–16, was very
                        worthwhile from the Department’s view-point. Apparently industry
                        representatives also regarded the meetings as successful as the consensus
                        was that consideration should be given to calling similar meetings at
                        appropriate times in the future. The meeting furnished an opportunity for a
                        frank exchange of views on the problems that exist in this field. Department
                        representatives stressed that the US cannot deal with aviation in a
                        compartment but that it is a part of our economic and political relations
                        with other countries and that a policy of restrictionism in the aviation
                        field would be inconsistent with our policy in the whole trade field:</p>
                    <p>No policy decisions were reached in the meeting, nor were any expected
                        because of the exploratory nature of the discussions. The problems were
                        dealt with in an objective manner and discussions were conducted in a
                        friendly spirit of cooperation for the national interest. Views expressed by
                        the participants will be taken into careful consideration in development and
                        application of US policy in the conduct of air transport relations with
                        other countries.</p>
                    <p>While no policy decisions were reached, an examination of some of the major
                        difficulties the US faces with other countries in international aviation
                        matters resulted in a change of atmosphere on some points which should, the
                        Department believes, be helpful in future negotiations.</p>
                    <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0503"/>
                    <p>One of the most important areas in which progress was made concerns the US
                        position toward fifth freedom carriage, which is the right of airlines to
                        carry traffic to and from third countries on international trunk routes. In
                        past negotiations the instructions of the US delegation have precluded any
                        compromise on this matter. This is a major bone of contention between the US
                        and other countries, which feel they cannot give their airlines enough
                        protection if our lines have unlimited fifth freedom rights. They are also
                        dissatisfied with the US interpretation of Bermuda principles in that
                        regard. As a result, the US has had to sacrifice some of its third and
                        fourth freedom rights (to fly to and from another country) in order to
                        preserve its position against any concession on fifth freedom. This was
                        particularly true in the case of the air agreement with India. (See <ref
                            target="#pg_1">page 1</ref>, February 7, 1956 issue.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d175fn2">Not printed.</note>) Our airlines are beginning to
                        realize that this is a pretty stiff price to pay for fifth freedom and it
                        appears likely that in the future, where conditions warrant, they may be
                        willing to agree to some negotiating leeway on fifth freedom rights. A
                        degree of flexibility on fifth freedom should assist the US in protecting
                        its major concern—a strong international network of US airlines based on
                        third and fourth freedom traffic.</p>
                    <p>Another important subject which was discussed concerned American airlines
                        having a majority or minority interest in the airlines of other countries.
                        The <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> has discouraged this in the past,
                        largely because of the influence the US airline would have when aviation
                        negotiations take place between the two countries. However, with the advent
                        of Russian aviation penetration of underdeveloped countries, the Department
                        is anxious that American companies establish themselves in these areas to
                        forestall Soviet efforts to provide aviation assistance. Almost the entire
                        group at the meeting felt that a way must be found to eliminate red tape and
                        expedite <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> hearing processes so that
                        American companies can get into an area quickly where it would be in US
                        national interest to do so. There was not such general agreement when the
                        factor is investment by a friendly European country rather than by a Soviet
                        bloc country. While there are some political considerations in those
                        instances, the problem is largely economic. When European domination exists
                        in the airline of a third country—often a Western Hemisphere country—the
                        Department pointed out that the US gets into difficulty with the European
                        country when it refuses to grant a route or some other aviation request of
                        the third country. Then, too, third countries orient themselves toward the
                        international trunk lines of the European countries rather than to those of
                        the US and also orient themselves toward the European country
                        equipmentwise.</p>
                    <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0504"/>
                    <p>The Department also pointed up the problem it faces in the timing of aviation
                        negotiations with other countries as related to the public hearing
                        procedures of the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>. The <gloss
                            target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> first holds hearings and reaches decisions
                        on where the US wants to fly. Then it has hearings on which company should
                        be certificated. During this long period of public hearings, the other
                        countries find out where the US wants routes and how much its lines estimate
                        they will realize through this service. The result is that the US has no
                        bargaining power when it starts to negotiate. This procedure is particularly
                        stultifying when one of the new nations that are coming into being wants to
                        have an aviation agreement with the US. As a result, other countries are
                        often able to negotiate aviation agreements with the new country before the
                        US does. The Department urged that whenever such cases occur, the US should
                        negotiate an air agreement as quickly as possible and that it could be put
                        in “deep freeze” until some time later when the <gloss target="#t_CAB1"
                            >CAB</gloss> is in a position to issue permits to the airlines. There
                        was general agreement at the meeting with the Department’s position in this
                        regard.</p>

                            1957<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Ibid</hi>.)</note> requesting the views of the Department of State
                        with respect to S.1423, the following comments are submitted.</p>
                    <p>S.1423 proposes “to amend sections 801, 802, and 1102 of the Civil
                        Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended.” The Department wishes to comment on
                        (1) the aspect of the bill which would limit the President’s review of Civil
                        Aeronautics Board decisions on applications of air carriers or foreign air
                        carriers for authority to engage in foreign air transportation to cases in
                        which the President determines that the Board’s decision might affect the
                        national defense or foreign policy of the United States, and (2) the aspect
                        which would require that a representative of the United States airline
                        industry should be <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0505"/>made a duly
                        accredited member of the United States delegation in any formal negotiation
                        with another country on matters relating to air transportation.</p>
                    <p>The amendment of section 801 of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 in the
                        manner proposed in S.1423 would apparently be intended to reduce the number
                        of cases relating to foreign air transportation which should be reviewed by
                        the President. In any case where a United States airline is certificated to
                        serve a point in a foreign country or a foreign airline is authorized to
                        operate into the United States the foreign policy of the United States is
                        automatically involved. There is a strong probability that many cases
                        involving foreign air transportation will affect the national defense of the
                        United States. Therefore, it will be necessary for the President to continue
                        to review all Civil Aeronautics Board decisions relating to international
                        air transportation to determine the nature and extent of their impact on the
                        foreign relations of the United States and the national defense.
                        Accordingly, this Department concludes that the proposed amendment of
                        section 801 will not in any way reduce the burden on the President and
                        recommends against the enactment of this portion of S.1423.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State strongly recommended against the adoption of
                        legislation, introduced in the Senate during the Second Session of the 84th
                        Congress, which would require that a representative of the airline industry
                        be made a duly accredited member of the United States delegation in any
                        formal air transport negotiations. Actual experience of the last few months
                        has increased the conviction of this Department that enactment of the bill
                        into law would be contrary to the best interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>International air transportation serves the United States as a whole by
                        providing fixed and dependable air transportation to other countries. While
                        the airlines of the United States which provide such transportation are
                        vitally affected by the agreements which this Government is able to conclude
                        with other governments for the purpose of making possible such air transport
                        services, other segments of the United States are also vitally affected by
                        these agreements. Communities served by international airlines are keenly
                        aware of the advantages of air transportation connecting them with other
                        countries and are increasingly desirous of influencing the position to be
                        taken by United States delegations in the negotiation of agreements to
                        establish international air routes. Aircraft manufacturers of the United
                        States are also interested in the effect on their business of arrangements
                        which can influence the growth of markets for their products.</p>
                    <p>Because of the direct effect of the agreements on the business of the airline
                        industry the Government has consistently provided representatives <pb
                            n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0506"/>of that industry an opportunity to
                        consult with the Government and, in most cases, to serve as observers on the
                        delegations negotiating such agreements. The Department does not believe,
                        however, that it would be in the public interest to give the airline
                        industry a still further preferred position in this regard, especially as
                        compared with other groups having an equally important and valid interest in
                        civil aviation agreements. Since it is obvious that it would not be either
                        desirable or feasible to add to the negotiating delegations representatives
                        of all interests that might possibly be affected by the outcome of the
                        negotiations, it is believed undesirable to create for any of them a
                        preferred position beyond that presently accorded.</p>
                    <p>The portion of the bill which relates to participation of the airline
                        industry in air transport negotiations also sets forth procedures to be
                        followed in the course of such negotiations. The Department considers it of
                        the utmost importance to receive the advice and views of the airline
                        industry, and believes that the intention of S.1423, as expressed in that
                        portion dealing with procedures to be followed in international
                        negotiations, is currently being met. Prior to the commencement of
                        negotiations the Civil Aeronautics Board advises the United States air
                        carriers that such negotiations will take place and affords an opportunity
                        for them to meet with representatives of the Board and this Department to
                        discuss matters to be considered in the negotiations. Throughout the course
                        of the negotiations the airline industry has a continuing opportunity to
                        present its views to the negotiators.</p>
                    <p>As a general rule the industry has been afforded an opportunity to have a
                        representative serve as an observer on delegations in formal negotiations on
                        air transport matters. The observer normally is designated by the Air
                        Transport Association. It is the intention of the Department to continue the
                        practice of conferring with the airline industry and to have an industry
                        observer on delegations to the extent feasible. Experience has shown,
                        however, that in most instances the airline industry is unable to provide an
                        observer who can speak for the industry as a whole. In the absence of
                        unanimity the Air Transport Association representative can only observe and
                        report to members of the Association. However, there are a small number of
                        airlines which are not members of the Air Transport Association. When an
                        airline affected by an air transport negotiation is not a member of the Air
                        Transport Association a representative of that Association is not a true
                        representative of the industry.</p>
                    <p>Accreditation to a delegation binds each member to the position which has
                        been adopted by the United States. Therefore, should an airline
                        representative be accredited to the delegation he would lose his position as
                        a special representative of a special interest and <pb n="477"
                            xml:id="pg_477" facs="0507"/>become bound to take all steps necessary to
                        insure the affectual presentation of the governmental position
                        notwithstanding any inherent conflict of interest which might exist because
                        of the special interest of the group which he represents. The observer
                        capacity, therefore, is the most advantageous position on the delegation
                        that the Government can offer to the air transport industry.</p>
                    <p>Here a mandatory requirement that a representative of the United States
                        airline industry be accredited as a member of the United States delegation
                        to be enacted it would be impossible for this Government to insist upon the
                        exclusion of a representative of a foreign airline, even when such exclusion
                        would be in the best interest of the United States and the United States
                        airlines.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, in some cases the foreign government with which the United
                        States is negotiating insists that airline representatives be excluded from
                        the negotiations. Sometimes this insistence is based on the principle that
                        inter-governmental negotiations should not be conducted in the presence of
                        non-governmental personnel, particularly those with partisan interest in the
                        outcome of the negotiations. In other cases it is felt that the presence of
                        airline representatives destroys the opportunity for frank discussions,
                        hampers negotiations, and renders ultimate agreement more difficult, if not
                        impossible. The recent tendency of airline industry representatives to
                        disclose the status of negotiations while they are still in progress can
                        only serve to increase the opposition of foreign governments to the presence
                        of such airline representatives. In certain cases where negotiations were
                        held at the request of the United States for the purpose of obtaining rights
                        important to the airlines of the United States and to the national interest
                        the other country refused to negotiate in the presence of airline
                        representatives.</p>
                    <p>In view of the above comments this Department recommends that no legislation
                        be enacted which would in any way destroy the flexibility which is often the
                        essential qualification on which the ability to obtain an agreement in the
                        best interest of the United States may depend.</p>
                    <p>The Department also recommends against the provision of the bill that would
                        require the presence of an airline representative at all delegation
                        meetings. Such a requirement would be in effect a requirement that in some
                        instances considerations which should properly be brought to bear on the
                        subject not be discussed in delegation meetings. It is frequently necessary
                        for government representives serving on delegations to discuss matters which
                        are not public knowledge and which cannot in the interest of the security of
                        the United States and its international relations be divulged to persons
                        outside the Government. Accordingly, such matters could not be discussed in
                        the presence of an airline representative. In this connection <pb n="478"
                            xml:id="pg_478" facs="0508"/>it should be noted that, while the airline
                        industry can and should make its views known with regard to the matters of
                        air transport operations and aviation policy, these representatives do not
                        have the experience and information relative to matters outside the air
                        transport field to make them competent advisers on such other aspects of the
                        foreign relations of the United States as may be involved in a
                        negotiation.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there is a serious question whether the aspect of the bill
                        requiring a representative of the air carriers to be made a duly accredited
                        member of the United States delegation to formal negotiations with foreign
                        governments would be valid, since it represents an intrusion into the
                        exercise by the President of his authority under the Constitution to conduct
                        negotiations with foreign governments through representatives of his
                        choosing.</p>
                    <p>For all of the above reasons the Department believes the enactment of S.1423
                        would hamper rather than help the interests of the United States as a whole
                        and the ability of the Government to strengthen and protect our
                        international airlines. Accordingly, the Department is opposed to the
                        enactment of S.1423. The Department would welcome the opportunity to discuss
                        in further detail its views on S.1423 with members of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>The Department has been advised by the Bureau of the Budget that there is no
                        objection to the submission of this report and that the enactment of S.1423
                        would not be in accord with the program of the President.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d176fn3">The Secretary of State had sent a somewhat similar

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJR1"
                            >Durfee</persName></hi>: From time to time this Department has been
                        concerned by the fact that opinions written by Civil Aeronautics Board
                        Examiners appear to indicate that the Examiners are not familiar with the
                        policies and practices of the United States in connection with international
                        air transport matters. It is not the intention of this Department to request
                        the Civil Aeronautics Board to derogate in any way from the independence of
                        thought, or the quasi judicial character of the work, of the Examiners. It
                        is, however, suggested that the Examiners should have some general knowledge
                        of the manner in which the statements made in their reports on international
                        matters may affect the possibility of obtaining the very rights which they
                        propose should be exercised by United States airlines.</p>
                    <p>It has been noted for example that the Examiners may refer rather strongly to
                        the manner in which the granting of a particular certificate to a United
                        States airline will increase that airline’s ability to compete with certain
                        named foreign airlines. More recently, and most provocatively, the Examiner
                        in the New York-Mexico City Nonstop Service Case repeatedly referred to the
                        ability of the airline recommended for the route to carry fifth freedom
                        traffic from Mexico to Europe. References tending to indicate that the
                        United States is certificating an airline primarily for the purpose of
                        carrying fifth freedom traffic, or that the route for which an airline is
                        certificated is of value primarily because of the ability of the airline to
                        generate fifth freedom traffic on such a route, do not correspond to the
                        United States position under the Bermuda type of agreement that fifth
                        freedom traffic is a secondary type of traffic on routes granted under those
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>It has repeatedly been urged by the United States in international
                        negotiations that a route must be justified on the basis of third and fourth
                        freedom traffic and that fifth freedom traffic has a secondary role in
                        justifying a route. For example, the long negotiation with the Netherlands,
                        and much of the ensuing discussion, related to the quantity of fifth freedom
                        traffic involved on the routes under discussion. The countries which have
                        heard the United States arguments of this nature may well doubt the
                        sincerity of those arguments when they read Examiners’ opinions expressing
                        views such as those expressed in the New York-Mexico City case. It <pb
                            n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0510"/>may be noted that the Mexican
                        Government did send a note to the United States Government, expressing
                        distrust in the possible designation of a United States airline for the
                        “primary purpose” of carrying traffic from Mexico to Europe.</p>
                    <p>In order to avoid such an apparent divergence of principle in United States
                        Government agencies, and in fact within the Board itself, it is suggested
                        that the Examiners be thoroughly acquainted with the policies followed by
                        the United States in air transport negotiations. Attention should be drawn
                        specifically to the problems created by over-emphasis on the impact of
                        United States carrier operations on those of foreign carriers and the
                        statement or implication that the carriage of fifth freedom traffic will
                        constitute a major reason for the operations for which United States
                        airlines are certificated.</p>

                                >Ibid</hi>.)</note> requesting comments of this Department on
                        S.1852, “a bill to amend section 402(b) of the Civil Aeronautics Act of
                        1938, as amended.”</p>
                    <p>The bill would provide that in the future no foreign air carrier permit
                        should be issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board unless the Board should find
                        that “the service of the foreign air carrier in the operation of the route
                        will be primarily to meet the demands of traffic originating or terminating
                        in the country of which such carrier <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0511"
                        />is a national”. The Department of State recommends against the enactment
                        of such a provision since it would serve as a precedent for restrictive
                        measures by other countries to the detriment of the international air
                        transport system of the United States.</p>
                    <p>It is a fundamental tenet of the air transport agreements under which the
                        United States obtains, and grants, rights for the operation of international
                        air services that the services to be performed shall be primarily for the
                        carriage of traffic between the country of the nationality of the airline
                        and other countries. It is an equally valuable aspect of those agreements
                        that traffic between two foreign countries (generally referred to as fifth
                        freedom traffic) may also be carried. The agreements contain provisions
                        enabling a country which believes that the carriage of the latter class of
                        traffic has become excessive to request consultation with the other country
                        for the purpose of deciding whether such traffic is in fact excessive.</p>
                    <p>One of the major obstacles which the United States airlines operating abroad
                        have encountered has been the desire of other countries to unilaterally
                        determine whether such traffic is indeed excessive. Accordingly, it has been
                        a matter of great concern to the Government of the United States to prevent
                        such unilateral action on the part of other countries. Enactment of
                        legislation such as that proposed in S.1852 would make further protection of
                        United States airlines against unilateral action by other countries
                        exceedingly difficult.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, there is enclosed a statement of statistics<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d178fn3">Not found attached.</note> concerning the operation of
                        United States airlines abroad. A statistical survey of 1955 traffic
                        indicates that in forty-four countries United States airlines have carried
                        more traffic not originating or terminating in the United States than
                        traffic originating or terminating in this country. In several of those
                        countries less than 20% of the passengers carried by the United States
                        airlines originate or terminate in the United States, although in three of
                        those cases the United States airline is carrying local traffic within the
                        other country to supplement incomplete services offered by local carriers.
                        In only fifteen countries of the fifty-nine countries covered do the United
                        States airlines meet the test set forth in S.1852.</p>
                    <p>The statistics have been drawn up on the basis of numbers of passengers
                        rather than of passenger miles, since this is the accepted international
                        practice. Because of the long transocean flight between the United States
                        and most other countries figures based on passenger miles would be more
                        favorable to the United States carriers. However, the transportation of a
                        comparatively large number of short-haul passengers by United States
                        airlines between foreign <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0512"/>countries
                        is essential to the continuation of long-trunk services and round-the-world
                        operations. In many countries the desire to limit the carriage of fifth
                        freedom traffic by United States carriers is already extremely strong. If
                        the United States establishes a precedent of restrictionism these countries
                        would probably take similar steps.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, it is estimated that in 1955 United States scheduled
                        airlines earned over two hundred and twenty-five million dollars revenue
                        from international air transport. The estimated revenues of all foreign air
                        carriers derived from scheduled services into the United States was
                        approximately one hundred and nineteen million dollars. So long as the
                        United States can maintain a system in which unilateral controls are not
                        placed on United States airlines operations by foreign countries, there is
                        an opportunity for this favorable condition to continue to exist. It would,
                        however, be exceedingly dangerous for the United States to set a precedent
                        that could result in widespread unilateral action to limit the carriage of
                        so-called fifth freedom traffic by United States airlines.</p>
                    <p>While the statistics contained in the enclosed paper are derived from
                        unclassified material and have not been classified by this Department, they
                        have not heretofore been analyzed and published in this form.</p>
                    <p>The Department has been informed by the Bureau of the Budget that there is no
                        objection to the submission of this report.</p>

                            >Harris</persName></hi>: I refer to your letter of July 9, 1957,<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">Not printed.</note> in which you request the
                        views of the Department of State on House Resolution 305, “To express the
                        sense of the House of Representatives with respect to radio and television
                        broadcasts of interviews with official representatives of Communist and
                        Communist-dominated countries.”</p>
                    <p>After careful consideration of the Resolution the Department believes that
                        the proposal for prior approval by the Secretary of State of questions to be
                        put to an official representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
                        or any other Communist or Communist-dominated government in a radio or
                        television interview is incompatible with the traditional American
                        principles of freedom of speech and of the press. While the Department
                        concedes that there may be some advantage to control of propaganda content
                        of such interviews, it holds the view that such an advantage is clearly
                        outweighed by the undesirability of taking any action which runs counter to
                        traditional American freedoms.</p>
                    <p>It is felt that over and above any question of censorship, it can be pointed
                        out that the real propaganda line lies in the answer and not in the
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State furthermore believes that active consideration by the
                        Congress of House Resolution 305 would be particularly undesirable at the
                        present time since the Resolution is in sharp conflict with the United
                        States proposal of June 24, 1957, to the Government of the Union of Soviet
                        Socialist Republics for a regular exchange of uncensored radio and
                        television broadcasts. Such an exchange, in the Department’s view, would be
                        worthwhile only if it is free of censorship both by the United States and
                        the Soviet Union.</p>

                        Act certain principles governing foreign air transportation by any foreign
                        air carrier. Further, section 2 of the bill would require the Civil
                        Aeronautics Board to review at least annually the operations of foreign air
                        carriers to and from United States territory to ascertain whether those
                        operations were being conducted in accordance with the stated principles,
                        and to report annually to the President and the Congress the conclusions
                        reached by it and the action taken or proposed to be taken in consequence
                        thereof. The Department of State strongly recommends against the enactment
                        of provisions of this nature since they would establish a precedent for
                        restrictive measures by other countries to the irreparable detriment of the
                        international air transport system of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The air transport agreements under which the United States obtains, and
                        grants, rights for the operation of international air services provide that
                        air transport services offered thereunder: <list>

                            <item>shall relate closely to the requirements of the public for such
                                services;</item>

                                country of which the carrier is a national; and</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>shall, in the carriage of traffic not originating or terminating
                                in the country of which the carrier is a national, be governed by
                                the general principle that capacity should be related to (a) traffic
                                requirements between the country of origin and the countries of
                                ultimate destination of the traffic; (b) the requirements of through
                                airline operation; and (c) the traffic requirements of the area
                                through which the carrier passes, after taking account of local and
                                regional services.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Thus the principles proposed in section 1 of H.R. 8538 reproduce principles
                        expressed in the air transport agreements of the United States but with two
                        fundamental and decisive differences. In the first place the air transport
                        agreements provide that the above <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0515"
                        />principles shall be the basis for bilateral consultations to review past
                        operations. Secondly, as used in air transport agreements the above
                        principles are equally applicable to foreign air carriers and to United
                        States air carriers.</p>
                    <p>One of the major obstacles which the United States airlines operating abroad
                        have encountered has been the frequent attempts of other countries to
                        determine unilaterally whether United States air carriers meet the
                        principles set forth above and to enforce those principles by unilateral
                        action, such as limitation on frequencies and capacity of United States
                        airlines. Accordingly, the United States Government has been repeatedly
                        obliged to take either formal or informal action to prevent or minimize such
                        unilateral action on the part of other countries. The success it has had in
                        this regard is amply attested by the outstanding progress of United States
                        airlines in international services.</p>
                    <p>Enactment of legislation such as that proposed in H.R. 8538 would make
                        continued protection of United States airlines against unilateral action by
                        other countries virtually impossible. Other countries seeking a
                        justification for unilateral action against United States air carriers would
                        interpret the enactment of section 1 of H.R. 8538 as showing indisputably
                        that the United States Civil Aeronautics Board was to apply unilaterally the
                        principles set forth in connection with the issuance of an initial permit
                        for operation over a route described in an air transport agreement. Section
                        2 of the bill, requiring an annual review by the Civil Aeronautics Board,
                        would make it clear that any permit issued by the Board would be, in
                        practical effect, a temporary permit good for one year only and subject to
                        unilateral termination upon determination by the Board, without any
                        bilateral consultation, that those principles were breached.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the extensive through airline operations conducted by United States
                        air carriers, with their resultant high percentage of passengers who neither
                        originate nor terminate their trips in the United States, render the United
                        States carriers, like other long-trunk operators, particularly vulnerable to
                        unilateral limitations. The transportation of short-haul passengers between
                        foreign countries is essential to the continuation of long-trunk services
                        and round-the-world operations. In many countries the desire to limit the
                        carriage of such fifth freedom traffic by United States carriers is already
                        extremely strong due to the fact that the carriage of fifth freedom traffic
                        is in direct competition with local and regional services offered by
                        airlines of those countries. (Forty-eight of the sixty countries to which
                        United States carriers operate have carriers offering service over routes
                        identical or similar to routes flown by United States carriers.)</p>
                    <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0516"/>
                    <p>Thirty-two of the countries to which United States carriers operate do not
                        have airlines operating to the United States at all, thus the provisions of
                        H.R. 8538 would not have any direct effect on these countries at present.
                        Twenty of these thirty-two countries do, however, have airlines operating
                        over international routes identical or similar to routes over which United
                        States carriers transport fifth freedom passengers. For these twenty
                        countries H.R. 8538 would be meaningful only as a precedent on which to base
                        restrictive actions against United States airlines and as a strong defense
                        against efforts of the United States Government to protect United States
                        airlines from such restrictions. If the United States established a
                        precedent of restrictionism, these countries would undoubtedly take similar
                        steps.</p>
                    <p>The precedent of H.R. 8538 would, similarly, encourage the twenty-eight
                        countries which have airlines operating to the United States to adopt a
                        policy of unilateral restrictionism. On the basis of the best information
                        available to the Department, the airlines of at least nineteen of these
                        twenty-eight countries would meet the tests of H.R. 8538. On the other hand,
                        the lack of uniformity as to statistical methods for analyzing airline
                        operations (for example, whether to base the analysis on number of
                        passengers, on passenger miles, or on revenue; whether to base the analysis
                        on true origin and destination or on manifest origin and destination;
                        whether to base the analysis on only passengers or to include cargo and
                        mail) would enable the majority of these countries to find unilaterally a
                        statistical basis sufficient in their view to justify restricting the
                        operations of United States airlines.</p>
                    <p>One of the principal advantages of the theory of bilateral consultations
                        expressed in the air transport agreements of the United States is that the
                        United States Government is able to discuss its views with the other country
                        involved <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that country has publicly announced a
                        restrictive ruling. If a policy of unilateral restrictions is adopted, the
                        United States Government would be in the undesirable position of seeking the
                        reversal of restrictive orders after they had been made public. This
                        position would be even more difficult if any other country wishing to issue
                        permits on a year to year basis, or to enforce unilaterally compliance with
                        principles similar to those in section 1 of H.R. 8538 through limitation of
                        frequencies or other means, could cite United States law as proof that its
                        action was no more restrictive than that permissible under United States
                        legislation.</p>
                    <p>So long as the United States can maintain a system in which unilateral
                        controls are not placed on United States airlines operations by foreign
                        countries, there is an opportunity for the relatively favorable economic
                        position of the United States international air carriers to continue to
                        exist. It would, however, be exceedingly dangerous for the United States to
                        set a precedent that could result <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0517"
                        />in widespread unilateral action to limit the carriage of so-called fifth
                        freedom traffic by United States airlines. The risk of such reciprocal
                        unilateral action would be increased by the fact that H.R. 8538 would not
                        require the Civil Aeronautics Board itself to apply the same tests to the
                        operations of United States carriers as would be applied to foreign air
                        carriers.</p>
                    <p>For all of the above reasons the Department believes the enactment of H.R.
                        8538 would hamper rather than help the interests of the United States as a
                        whole and the ability of the Government to strengthen and protect United
                        States airlines operating internationally. Accordingly, the Department is
                        opposed to the enactment of that bill. The Department would welcome the
                        opportunity to discuss in further detail its views on H.R. 8538 with members
                        of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>The Department has been advised by the Bureau of the Budget that there is no
                        objection to the submission of this report and that the enactment of H.R.
                        8538 would not be in accord with the legislative program of the
                        President.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5726 reaffirms the long-range
                            United States objective of seeking to promote the safe and orderly
                            development of international air transportation on the basis of
                            reciprocal rights and the broadest freedom consistent with national
                            security and sound economic principles. The attainment of this objective
                            requires that entry of the USSR and the European Satellites into
                            international air routes of the Free World be consistent with Free World
                            security and with fundamental principles commonly followed throughout
                            the Free World. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5726 thus proposes
                            that United States civil aviation relations with the USSR and European
                            Satellites be based on certain conditions: e.g., that appropriate steps
                            be taken to guard United States internal security; that the rights and
                            privileges granted to the USSR and European Satellites are not more
                            favorable than those granted by the United States to Free World states
                            or greater than those received from the Soviet Bloc; and that any air

                            insofar as possible on the principles and practices as set forth in the
                            multilateral civil aviation conventions and arrangements, and the
                            bilateral air transport agreements, generally accepted throughout the
                            Free World. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5726 also proposes that
                            the United States seek to persuade appropriate Free World states to

                            this to insist that any agreement or arrangement with that country be
                            fully reciprocal. Where complete reciprocity with European Satellites
                            (as distinguished from the USSR) cannot be obtained, <gloss

                            air traffic between the Free World and Communist China, North Korea and

                            relations in the early post-war period and did not appear likely to
                            permit scheduled services over Soviet territory by airlines of countries
                            outside the Soviet orbit, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 dealt
                            largely with air services between Western countries and the Soviet

                            minimum facilities necessary for operation outside Satellite

                    <p>The USSR is now strongly interested in extending its air routes, and has
                        exhibited willingness to open its territory to non-Satellite aircraft in
                        order to obtain desired rights in Free World countries. Recent Soviet
                        accomplishments in the production and utilization of modern civil aircraft
                        have demonstrated the USSR’s capability of challenging Western civil
                        aviation leadership. Moreover, West European governments are demonstrating
                        increased eagerness to expand their aviation relations with the USSR and
                        European Satellites. Their individual efforts to this end could have serious
                        effect on United States objectives in international civil aviation unless
                        channeled into a common course of action which will eventually induce the
                        USSR and the European Satellites to enter the international civil aviation
                        community on terms acceptable to the majority of its members.</p>

                            it is fully expected that by the end of 1959 Soviet civil aviation will
                            have a substantial number of turbo-jet and/or turbo-prop transports in

                            in limited quantities. In addition, Western Europe is showing increasing
                            interest in Bloc markets and it will be increasingly difficult for the

                            agreements barring export of such equipment to the Bloc. The sale to the

                                rejection by the USSR of early post-World War II efforts of the

                                of Bloc states; the negative attitude of Soviet Bloc states toward
                                the development of scheduled air services between East and West; the
                                failure of Bloc states to adhere to post-World War II multilateral
                                conventions on international civil aviation or to participate in the
                                activities of the international air transport community of the Free
                                World; and the ability of Soviet Bloc states to exploit civil

                                espionage purposes. These circumstances were not only phenomena of
                                the Cold War, but may also have been due in part to factors within
                                the USSR such as (1) concern for the military security implications
                                of over-flight of USSR territory by non-Soviet commercial aircraft;
                                (2) a sensitive awareness that the USSR did not have the aircraft,
                                ground equipment and technical personnel required to compete
                                successfully in international civil aviation; and (3) a realization
                                that the important strategic geographical position of the USSR could
                                be more advantageously bargained in the future as the desire of Free

                                the problem with which it dealt was not one of determining how best

                                USSR, but one of establishing a short-term policy toward air

                                formulated. Soviet foreign policy underwent significant changes
                                which, for a time, resulted in a generally less explosive
                                international situation. The changes involved over-all East-West
                                relations as well as the relatively narrow field of civil aviation
                                with which <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 was designed to
                                deal. The developments in these two fields are complementary, and
                                changes in one reflect or stimulate action in the other. The USSR
                                made important advances in the civil aviation field and revealed a
                                limited readiness to open its territory to airlines of Bloc and

                            <item>In 1955 the U.S. Government joined with the British and French in
                                proposing at the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers that
                                agreement should be reached in principle for reciprocal exchanges of
                                direct air transport services between cities of the Soviet Union and
                                Western nations on the basis of normal bilateral air transport
                                agreements. The Soviets refused to accept the proposal, thus
                                retaining freedom of action to try to conclude agreements with those
                                countries on terms advantageous to the USSR. Soviet tactics as
                                evidenced to date indicate that the USSR may attempt to exploit this
                                freedom of action in combination with its strategic geographic
                                position to extend its influence and to undermine Western efforts in

                                made in the context of the Western position on East-West contacts.
                                It was subsequently included in the Seventeen-Point Program of this

                                and approved by the President on June 29, 1956. This Declaration
                                made reference to air service exchanges between the USSR and “the
                                three Western countries”, as had been done in the initial tripartite
                                proposal which was introduced at the Geneva Foreign Ministers
                                Meeting in 1955. The tripartite proposal which was introduced at
                                Working Group level and which formed the basis for discussion with
                                the Soviets at Geneva, made reference to air exchanges between the

                            <item>Developments since 1950 make it necessary to re-examine the
                                premises on which <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 was
                                based. These developments affected related circumstances and
                                conditions which had facilitated efforts to execute the prescribed
                                policy. Thus, the propositions that Satellite airlines are
                                instruments of the USSR and that Satellite airline operations to the
                                non-Bloc areas present threats to the security of free countries,
                                are rendered less critical by new confidence on the part of Free
                                world governments that they are strong enough to withstand the
                                pressures and are able to exercise necessary controls; the
                                proposition that, in weighing the various factors to be considered
                                in making a “balance of advantages” determination, military
                                considerations override economic and political factors, no longer
                                obtains, although the threat of Soviet penetration continues to be a
                                major problem; non-Bloc airlines have expanded their aircraft fleets
                                and are seeking <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0533"/>new routes
                                to ensure full utilization; Bloc airlines are expanding their
                                fleets, raising their standards of operations and service, and are
                                becoming better able to meet the test of comparison with Western
                                airlines; the increase in East-West commercial and cultural contacts
                                renders the establishment of East-West routes commercially more
                                attractive; the United States no longer is the sole producer of
                                modern transport aircraft, and, having relinquished its status as an
                                Occupying Power in Germany and Austria, no longer is in a position

                                p. 1777</ref>.</note> In the six months just ended, the Agency
                        attained an operational plane which permitted development of new methods for
                        pursuing its mission successfully, bringing various elements into closer
                        coordination, focusing effort more sharply, and planning on a longer-range
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>Substantively, operations reflected American reactions to nuclear age
                        developments and emphasized more heavily America’s devotion to peace and the
                        need for unity and strength to maintain it. The Agency launched a cultural
                        campaign to make the American way of life better understood, and capitalized
                        on the series of Free World accomplishments which strengthened unity of
                        purpose and resolved long-standing differences.</p>
                    <p>Numerous … in Southeast Asia, the Near East and Latin America were devoted to
                        undermining Soviet prestige and effectiveness. A special action plan was put
                        into effect unobtrusively to capitalize on the underlying animosities of the
                        Chinese for Russians. At the same time, the Agency attempted generally to
                        offer audiences more positive concepts in its output, showing that the U.S.
                        is not merely or even primarily concerned with opposing Communism but stands
                        for things which humanity values, and devotes itself to human progress.</p>
                    <p>In response to a special request by the Director, Agency personnel in the
                        U.S. and overseas responded with a flow of ideas which might help in the
                        winning of men’s minds. The Agency also began to develop longer-range
                        delineation of standing policy, to give operations continuity and coherence,
                        and to develop global guidance which will marshal facilities in all
                        geographic areas behind objectives with worldwide significance.</p>
                    <p>In all areas <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> field posts have developed
                        specific short-range objectives to focus efforts on immediate as well as
                        more long-range tasks. This, in effect, is an additional pinpointing of
                        programs in time as well as audience.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">A. Major Propaganda Problems</hi></p>
                    <p>Two of the major propaganda problems during the period were the wide currency
                        given the Soviet slogan “peaceful co-existence” and continued Soviet
                        efforts, at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly and
                        elsewhere, to convince peoples that the U.S. is another western colonial
                        power.</p>
                    <p>To expose the “peaceful co-existence” slogan as a barren promise, the Agency
                        developed a third global theme designed to convince peoples abroad that the
                        U.S. stands and works for peace, and for a peace which is more meaningful
                        than simple co-existence of two blocs of nations. All of the statements by
                        the President and other top officials on this subject were widely
                        publicized. The Christmas Pageant of Peace, highlighted by the President’s
                        message, was given extensive coverage around the world, in many places by
                        simultaneous observances. Effort was concentrated on developing confidence
                        in the free world in the light of successes such as the London and Paris
                        agreements, the Manila Pact, resolution of the Trieste problem, and other
                        actions which demonstrate the essential unity of purpose of the free
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The issue of colonialism continues to be a propaganda problem, particularly
                        in former colonial areas, and one which will not be easily overcome. We
                        have, however, continued to emphasize the genuine interest of the U.S. in
                        the independence of all free nations.</p>
                    <p>Every statistical and other opportunity to reflect the soundness of the U.S.
                        economy was utilized by press, radio and other media to generate confidence
                        in the stability of the U.S. News and features on U.S. forces capabilities
                        and new weapons were used to show the strength-for-defense of this country,
                        without rattling any sabres. Official and editorial statements demonstrating
                        U.S. determination to deter aggression were emphasized. To balance the
                        picture of U.S. military might and help prove its purely defensive purposes,
                        the Agency continued to utilize discussion of disarmament possibilities,
                        mainly in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, to show that the U.S. is
                        sincerely intent on finding some properly safeguarded means of controlling
                        armaments.</p>
                    <p>During the period under review, all available means were used to combat false
                        impressions abroad and to further the understanding that in the United
                        States democratic processes and the rights of individuals were safe and that
                        basic American unity remained strong.</p>
                    <p>Particular attention was devoted to an effort to convey to others the deep
                        morality characteristic of the U.S. and to show that America stands for
                        positive values, including the positive freedoms—freedom to learn, to
                        debate, to worship, to work, to live and to <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507"

                        theme was still further enhanced. The Voice continued to broadcast back to
                        the USSR anti-religious actions and statements of Soviet leaders. That
                        Moscow has subsequently ordered a soft-pedalling of its activities in

                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> continued its active participation in
                        the Operations Coordinating Board and the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                            >OCB</gloss> inter-agency working groups.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, contact with the work of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> was improved by designation of an officer to attend all
                        meetings of the Planning Board and by the attendance of the Director at
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings. The resulting greater
                        familiarity with highest national security policy, and the reasoning behind
                        it, has proved of great value to the Agency in attempting to bring its
                        varied operations more squarely into line behind the national purposes they
                        are designed to support.</p>
                    <p>In its efforts to integrate its programs more fully with other activities of
                        the Government, the Agency sent representatives to serve on the U.S.
                        delegations to several international conferences, among them the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> session in Montevideo at the
                        year-end, the September meeting in Manila of the Southeast Asia Pact
                        nations, the December <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings in
                        Paris, the RIO conference on inter-American economic affairs, and the
                        General Assembly session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in New
                        York. At each, the Agency was afforded a better insight into the matters it
                        is responsible for explaining to peoples abroad, and was enabled to
                        contribute its points of view in the pooling of ideas for accomplishing U.S.
                        purposes more successfully in the information and psychological realm.</p>
                    <p>The Agency advisor to the delegation at the General Assembly was in New York
                        for the duration of the Assembly session, providing policy direction to the
                        Agency’s coverage of developments at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                        Delegates of other countries were utilized extensively for recorded
                        interviews to be beamed abroad over Voice of America facilities or to be
                        sent to their home countries for broadcast on indigenous radio stations and
                        networks. Speeches, statements and actions of the U.S. delegation were
                        widely employed by all <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> media. The
                        Agency played a major role in organizing an atomic energy exhibit for a
                        reception sponsored by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> and attended by representatives of all other
                        delegations. This was credited with helping to obtain unanimous adoption of
                        the “peaceful atomic uses” item on the General Assembly agenda. Later, a
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> “Atoms for Peace” exhibit
                        (destined for subsequent shipment to South Asia) was displayed in the

                        November 29. It evoked favorable reactions from other delegations and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat, which proposed that

                    <p>Agency steps to strengthen its cultural program were taken in a special
                        effort to gain the respect of foreign intellectuals (artists, writers,
                        educators, persons in the professions) for American leadership, and to gain
                        their active allegiance to the principles of the Free World. One such step
                        was a message by the Director to the field July 6, 1954,<note n="4"

                    <p>Reception is better in suburban and rural areas. The Schramm Report concluded

                        the regimes want to suppress, and to create a favorable climate of opinion

                        eventual liberation from Soviet control. Heavy emphasis was given the “new

                        reversal of the basic Communist position. VOA also stressed conflicts
                        between old line “Stalinists”, who are afraid of measures likely to weaken
                        party controls, and the “new course” elements, who recognize that Stalinist
                        practices must be modified.</p>

                        the international Communist conspiracy.</p>
                    <p>Special emphasis was placed on the policies, problems and failures in Soviet
                        agriculture and the apparent inability of the regime to take steps required

                    <p>Plans are now underway to develop means other than radio for reaching Soviet
                        audiences. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> has formulated a set of
                        concrete proposals designed, on the one hand, to improve information
                        penetration of the USSR and, on the other, to enhance the effectiveness of
                        existing information programs, directed to the Soviet Union. The ideas were
                        discussed in detail with Ambassador Bohlen when he was in Washington in
                        November and they are undergoing further study. With Department of State
                        advice and assistance, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> is endeavoring
                        to determine their practicability and put into operation any that may be
                        prudent and feasible. The possibilities include revival of the Russian
                        language periodical “Amerika”, introduction of American classical books,
                        circulation of more American “movies”, getting printed matter to sailors in
                        alien ports and the soldiers stationed abroad, exchanging more persons, use
                        of other governments’ publications as vehicles for materials to be
                        circulated in the USSR, developing pressures to induce Soviet publications
                        to reproduce more of official U.S. statements, employment of additional or
                        auxiliary transmitters, circulating anti-jamming hints, putting more power
                        behind English language programs (which are not jammed), and inaugurating
                        the special music program designed for the “golden youth” of the USSR. The
                        music program, begun on New Year’s Eve, is aimed ostensibly at a
                        Scandinavian audience but is intended to capitalize on the interest of
                        Soviet youth in western popular music. It is hoped that gradually some
                        commentary can be included in the program.</p>

                        that more Italians, percentage-wise, were aware of the President’s program
                        than were Britons, French or Germans. Plans were laid for the exhibits to

                        alleged lack of economic progress in the area. The pamphlet was distributed
                        first at the Communist-front “People’s Congress of Southern Italy”, with

                            <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> made progress in overcoming
                        Government resistance to anti-Communist materials, and for the first time
                        induced the government to use <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> posters

                        audiences totalled 3.7 million during the calendar quarter ended September
                        30, 1954. The audiences were made up of government officials and moulders of
                        public opinion, armed forces and police, students and teachers, professional
                        societies, farmers and the general public.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> undertook additional steps to promote
                        Philippine prestige in Southeast Asia with the aim of increasing the chances

                        security, as envisioned in the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Pact.
                        Special attention also was devoted to placing in proper perspective the
                        controversy about U.S. bases in the Philippines. On this issue, a new press

                        provided basic subject matter for two of the three fundamental tasks on
                        which the Latin American program has been concentrated: (a) expounding the
                        free enterprise system and inter-American economic interdependence; (b)
                        exposing the threat of international communism and its machinations in the
                        area; and (c) demonstrating the positive values of democracy as exemplified
                        in American life and culture.</p>
                    <p>Faced with the pessimism and truculence that characterized informed Latin
                        American opinion in anticipation of the Rio Economic Conference, the Agency
                        sought by persistent use of research and feature material in all fast media
                        to support announced U.S. policies and to call popular attention to the
                        positive and dynamic aspects of our economic relations and of Latin
                        America’s own situation. At the Conference itself, a five-man information
                        team, providing tactical coverage by means of films, photographs, news
                        stories and recorded interviews, constituted a sensitive instrument to
                        exploit the better atmosphere that developed midway in the session.</p>
                    <p>Under the Economic Information Project established in the spring of 1954,
                        sets of an “economic bookshelf” were sent to the field for presentation, a
                        series of fourteen half-hour dramatic shows were produced for local
                        broadcast, seven short films were put out on self-help projects in Puerto
                        Rico and one on <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> in Haiti, and two major
                        films neared completion on the economic growth and prospects of the
                        hemisphere. Seven of thirteen monthly newsreels produced by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Brazil were released for showing in
                        Brazilian theatres. Two writer-photographer teams gathering raw material on
                            <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> achievements throughout the
                        Continent are about to complete their assignments.</p>
                    <p>In the Latin American program, effort was re-oriented toward priority
                        countries such as Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, and Guatemala, where chronic
                        conditions called for increased impact on public opinion. Special resources
                        were diverted on a short-term basis to Brazil, for the period of the
                        national elections, and to Chile, in <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0550"
                        />recognition of the critical politico-economic situation there. The scope
                        of the Bolivian program was increased with the development of numerous local
                        projects designed to publicize and complement <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> assistance.</p>
                    <p>In Guatemala, program activities were revised and elaborated to take
                        advantage of the post-revolutionary opportunity for re-establishing cultural
                        ties with the U.S. and aiding in the democratic reorientation of teachers,
                        labor and youth. By participation in an inter-agency task force sent to
                        Guatemala just after the revolution, the Agency obtained a large volume of
                        documentation for continuing use in exposing the methods and characteristics
                        of communism. It produced one film on Guatemala, purchased and distributed
                        another, and underwrote a Spanish edition of a current book on the subject.
                        Anti-Communist radio programs, in both recorded and script form, were
                        supplied to the field in considerable quantity.</p>
                    <p>In Middle America, particular attention was devoted to labor and free-labor
                        movements, especially in Mexico, Honduras and Panama, where specific
                        problems arise from Canal Zone relations. The regional media servicing
                        operation for Central America, based in Mexico, was strengthened and became
                        increasingly valuable.</p>
                    <p>Increasing use was made of the Agency publication “Problems of Communism”. In
                        Paraguay, responsible officials credited <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss> with turning the tide in favor of the Government’s
                        adoption of a resolution denouncing Communist intervention.</p>
                    <p>The central positive theme of the program was the President’s “Atoms for
                        Peace” proposal. Of special significance was the elaborate exhibit entitled
                        “Atoms for the Benefit of Mankind” developed under <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> guidance and displayed at <persName>Sao Paulo</persName>,
                        Brazil, from August to December. Total attendance reached 300,000. A color
                        film of the exhibit was prepared for general distribution. A separate panel
                        exhibit on the same theme was provided to each Latin American post. Ten
                        other major exhibits were put into circulation and some 96,000 books and
                        publications transmitted for use by the Binational Centers or for
                        presentation.</p>
                    <p>The Wireless File was converted from a partial to a complete Spanish-language
                        news service and steps were taken to expedite its delivery to consumers. As
                        an immediate result, the largest Brazilian newspaper chain agreed to
                        incorporate the File into its own telegraphic service to journals in the
                        interior, assuring far wider coverage than ever before achieved.</p>
                    <p>An agreement was reached and put into effect with the Government of Puerto
                        Rico for wide distribution by the Agency of films, pamphlets and other
                        materials supporting U.S. objectives produced by the Puerto Rican
                        Information Program. This major project will <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521"

                    <p>The first item on the agenda was the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        appropriations. The President opened the discussion by saying that the
                        appropriations for the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> were very close
                        to his heart and that actually they were about half the size of the
                        appropriations in 1952 when they amounted to $150 million. He said last year
                        he had asked for $88 million and had gotten $77 million. He said that
                        Streibert, the new head of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, was an
                        excellent man, dedicated to his job and that under his administration the
                        employees of the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> had been cut from
                        some 14,200 to 10,000 with the result that the organization had been
                        streamlined and was improving day by day. He said that the Soviets spent
                        about $2 billion a year on their propaganda and that he thought it was
                        ridiculous for us to spend only a small amount. “The Russians are spending
                        more money in Germany for their propaganda than we are spending in the
                        entire world. We are trying to convince the people in the world that we are
                        working for peace and not trying to blow them to kingdom come with our atom
                        and thermonuclear bombs. We are doing a good job on this and as a matter of
                        fact, we have run the Russians out of two trade fairs. But we need some more
                        money and it must go back to the $90 million level. The House has already
                        cut it down by $11 million and I hope that you people in the Senate will
                        restore it.”</p>
                    <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0552"/>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName> interrupted to ask if
                        the $2 billion figure reported by the President included the cost to the
                        Soviets of running their newspapers and radio stations. The President said
                        that it did—that this figure was the cost of everything the Soviet was
                        spending on propaganda. Halleck said he was sure everyone in both Houses was
                        vitally interested in this matter but the trouble seemed to be that
                        Streibert and his people had not presented their case too well.<note n="4"

                    <p>The Outline Plan proposes in effect, that: <list>

                            <item>The United States strengthen the support of other peoples for the
                                principles which characterize a free society. It is expected that
                                activities implementing this plan will be concerned primarily with
                                the leader group in each country (political, educational, labor,
                                scientific). Emphasis will be upon concentrated impact with the
                                expectation that the local leaders will influence their followers to
                                accept the value of free world principles and recognize the
                                inconsistencies of Communist principles.</item>

                            <item>The United States do this by demonstrating how those principles
                                can be adopted in many different ways by other peoples as solutions
                                to their problems while recognizing that there can be no single,
                                dogmatic doctrine of free society.</item>

                            <item>The way to accomplish this is to use every opportunity to make
                                clear to the other peoples how the application of free world
                                principles in their societies will work to their advantage and how
                                the adoption of Communist principles will be to their
                                detriment.</item>

                            <item>This can best be achieved by taking specific positions on issues
                                which are important to the target audiences and not by attempting
                                blatant indoctrination of other peoples in the American way of
                                life.</item>

                            <item>The most successful impact will result from quality rather than

                    <p>Responsibility for carrying out these operations rests with the several
                        agencies and their overseas missions as identified in the Outline Plan. It
                        is expected that the Principal Officer will insure that the several
                        operations are coordinated to the maximum degree practicable.</p>
                    <p>The members of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> agreed that only the
                        Department of State will send complete copies of the paper to our posts
                        listed above. The other interested departments and agencies will send to
                        their representatives instructions regarding the implementation of those
                        sections with which the respective agency is directly concerned. The
                        implementation of the plan should be coordinated in the field by the
                        Principal Officer.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that this plan is not inflexible, is subject to change,
                        and does not contain everything that this Government may wish to do or may
                        find it necessary to do in this field.</p>
                    <p>Action of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> requires that the review of
                        the Outline Plan be completed by August 15, 1955. It is requested that
                        comments be received from each post not later than June 30, 1955. It is
                        particularly desired that comments concern: <list>

                    <p>The Pres. said he is concerned about the whole business between Congress and
                        ourselves on the prosecution of the Cold War. He now finds out they have
                        introduced bills on the Hill to constitute a Cold War Strategy Board. He
                        just heard about it and does not know the contents and does not know if he
                        can accept it. He will not if it means Congress is doing the Executive’s
                        job. But we must arrange our work so we get their support on a broad basis.
                        He has asked <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Rockefeller</persName> to talk with
                        the Sec. What about having a body of you, Commerce, <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss> etc. as a counterpart of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>. If through that we got appropriations—make it
                        advisory—such a group cannot testify in Congress of the happenings. If it is
                        separate in its own right, it can go down and report and he won’t do that.
                        So the Pres. wants <persName corresp="#p_RN1">NELSON</persName> to talk with
                        the Sec. Sarnoff<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2"><persName>David
                                Sarnoff</persName>, Chairman of the Board, National Broadcasting
                            Company, met on March 15 with the President and White House Press
                            Secretary <persName>James Hagerty</persName> to propose increasing the
                            budget for cold war propaganda. Prior to the White House meeting,
                            Sarnoff discussed the same subject with Senator <persName

                            address Democratic Senators about the proposal. (<hi rend="italic"

                        was there last evening and he said he could get all the support the Pres.
                        needs on the Hill, but didn’t tell him he was the author of the Strategy
                        Board. The Pres. said he is going to have his own. It would be in conformity
                        with what we wanted and would satisfy this desire and we could get the money
                        we needed. The exchange program and propaganda should be stepped up, etc. We
                        have to get into it more intensively. We have to be careful—the
                        responsibility is mine with you principally and <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, Commerce and whatever man who heads <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, Defense etc. We have to be careful on how
                        we do it.</p>
                    <p>The Sec. said it is all right to talk about Cold War Strategy—what do they
                        mean. No one knows. The Pres. said we have called it psychological warfare
                        for many years. It is an attack on the minds of men who will make war and
                        win them around etc. rather than to put all our eggs in a basket of fighting
                        war. It is a broad program. The Sec. said it is designed to bring about the
                        so-called liberation within the satellite countries. The Pres. thinks that
                        is one step—but it is more—disaffection behind the Iron Curtain, winning
                        South America etc. etc. The Sec. said if you do that, that is foreign
                        policy. The Pres. said it is the implementation of it. How do you do it? The
                        Sec. said by the Mutual Security Act, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The Pres. said the <pb n="525"
                            xml:id="pg_525" facs="0555"/>trouble is he has taken these things and
                        has had to plead for appropriations. Now, exactly as they passed the law on
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, it would seem to the Pres. we have
                        an out to take these implementing people and put them in with you and work
                        out something we will get greater support on. The Sec. does not think we
                        have trouble getting support. We do on a few items. The Pres. said one
                        leader talked doubtfully re <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The Sec.
                        said <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> turned back money. The Pres. said 2
                        years ago, and recently one Republican leader said they wanted to establish
                        a joint comm. to go in on the secret things, and the Pres. said he would not
                        go for it. The Pres. said he got the exchange program restored, but they cut
                        the information program etc. He personally thinks these things should be
                        stepped up and not cut back and authority should be kept where it belongs by
                        an organization that would satisfy them and get better support. The Sec.
                        said he would be delighted to talk with <persName corresp="#p_RN1"
                            >NELSON</persName> about it. The Pres. is afraid they will pass a law
                        that he will have to veto. They have not consulted him and told him
                            <persName corresp="#p_KW1">Knowland</persName> put it in. He is not sure
                        what it is, but is sure it is not acceptable to him and he wants to be ahead
                        of the game. The Pres. mentioned Sarnoff again, and said he wants the Sec.
                        and him to be masters of the situation.</p>
                    <p>The Pres. asked if the Sec. has done any more thinking about going to San
                        Francisco. The Sec. said not particularly. The Sec. said he does not think
                        there is any great reason for his doing it. The Pres. said Auriol<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d188fn3">Vincent Auriol, President of France.</note> brought it
                        up. The Sec. said A. has a great interest in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, but he does not represent much of France. The Pres. agreed.
                        The Pres. does not want to let down our people. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName> was concerned about it and what disturbed the Pres. is
                        one day in New England will be a fishing day so people will talk about his
                        appearing to be indifferent. They will talk further about this. The Pres.
                        said he would go out if he had a speech that was worth while. The Sec. said
                        that’s it. A major speech is almost more than we can handle with all we have
                        to do. The Pres. said <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">CD Jackson</persName>
                        feels so strongly about it he is writing a speech to send down. The Sec.
                        said that would be fine.</p>

                    <p>The new spirit of amity dramatically proclaimed at the Geneva “Summit”
                        Conference will very likely induce questions to you and your staff by
                        American and other visitors along the line of, “Now that East and West seem
                        to have seen each other’s point of view, why is a U.S. information program
                        necessary? Shouldn’t it be reduced or eliminated? Isn’t the anti-Communist
                        aspect of your program now in direct conflict with current American foreign
                        policy?”</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, it must be clearly understood that the United States is not in
                            the information business solely as a result of the Communist threat. The
                            removal of the entire communist apparatus from the scene would still
                            leave the information program a necessary instrument for the effective
                            articulation of America’s voice in world affairs. The fact is that this
                            country, willingly or not, is now and will continue to be involved in
                            every world question of any magnitude. That involvement obliges us, in
                            pursuance of the best interests of the American people to seek the
                            support and understanding of other nations and peoples for the policies
                            and actions which the United States pursues. As a recent British report
                            on their own information program stated: “We have found it impossible to
                            avoid the conclusion that a modern government has to concern itself with
                            public opinion abroad and be properly equipped to deal with it.”</item>
                        <item>Secondly, it is true that international communism, while not the
                            exclusive justification for the information program, has in recent years
                            posed the greatest challenge to the principles for which this country
                            stands, while that challenge is buttressed by significant military
                            force, its emphasis has tended to shift more and more into the
                            psychological realm as outward tensions have relaxed. It is for this
                            reason that we here are convinced that <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                >USIA</gloss>’s role has taken on heightened significance and
                            urgency. This letter seeks to suggest some of the more important aspects
                            of that role as they relate to the kind of questions which you may be
                            receiving as a result of the “Summit” meeting.</item>

                            1955–58)</note> No evidence yet exists that the Soviet leaders have
                        altered their basic long-range plans for world domination. At Geneva, in
                        fact, Bulganin refused even to discuss either international communism or the
                        status of the satellites, two of the issues which this country believes to
                        be primary causes of world tension. Our program must continue to make this
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>We must remember also that the questions which the Summit conference did
                        discuss dealt only with Europe. There are thorny issues in the Far East and
                        Near East that still challenge settlement. Communism remains an active and
                        divisive force in Latin America. We must continue to make our government’s
                        position clear on the problems of these other areas.</p>
                    <p>While Bulganin claimed at Geneva that international communism was not a
                        proper subject for the conference, the threat of communist subversion and
                        violence in many countries throughout the world is certainly no less since
                        the meeting at the Summit. In our work, therefore, there is no less need to
                        make clear the peril of organized international communism.</p>
                    <p>In the past our task was often rendered easier by the bellicose actions and
                        statements of Stalin and his cohorts. Questions of international right and
                        wrong were reasonably well defined. But the Soviet leaders’ recent
                        dramatization of peaceful co-existence via “garden party diplomacy,” state
                        visits to other countries, and the partial relaxation of press and travel
                        restrictions are serving to blur the basic moral and political issues in
                        many people’s minds. This makes our job both more difficult and more
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>While we follow the President’s lead in accepting at face value the Soviet
                        leaders’ determination to work for peace, we must emphasize again and again
                        that protestations alone won’t do the job. The President himself has stated
                        that the real test of the “Geneva spirit” will come when the Foreign
                        Ministers meet at Geneva starting October 27, to attack the fundamental
                        issues. We need to state and restate what these issues are and to explain
                        the importance of resolving them if true peace is to be achieved.</p>
                    <p>Over and over again we must explain what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> mean by
                        peace. It is distinctly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a status quo peace,
                        sanctioning prolongation of a divided Germany; continued subjection of the
                        satellites; further extension of international communism; liquidation of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528"
                            facs="0558"/><gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> accompanied by the
                        withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe; and elimination of U.S. bases in
                        Europe and Africa. In resolving all these issues, the Soviets hope either to
                        consolidate recent gains by retention of the status quo or to reverse U.S.
                        policies which arose in response to continued Soviet aggression.</p>
                    <p>What the U.S. means by peace, on the other hand is a <hi rend="italic">peace
                            by change</hi>—a free Germany, reunified in the context of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and threatening neither East nor West;
                        eventual liberation of the satellites; a world freed from the violence and
                        subversion of international communism; and a free and expanding world
                        economy. This is peace with justice and freedom, not between rival blocs but
                        between nations acting in the true interest of all peoples. Our information
                        program must clarify this distinction and make it stick.</p>
                    <p>The Geneva Conference gave us one great advantage: President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, by the eloquence of his
                        statements and the force of his personality, went far toward convincing most
                        peoples of the deep desire for peace of the American people and their
                        government. He thus to a large degree canceled out Soviet propaganda of the
                        last five years designed to place the onus of warmongering on the United
                        States. Our information program must help consolidate and extend this
                        advantage which the President has given us.</p>
                    <p>We can foresee the danger that the spirit of Geneva will encourage our allies
                        to relax and to question the need for sacrifice and high taxes in the
                        service of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_WEU1"
                            >WEU</gloss>. We can anticipate, too, an upsurge of neutralism. Our
                        information program must energetically combat these tendencies.</p>
                    <p>I hope that some of the above points will be of use to you in meeting the
                        kind of questions you are likely to be receiving.</p>

                    <p>The first six months of 1955 were notably a period of fluid development in
                        international affairs, which confronted the Agency <pb n="530"

                        neutralism, the relaxation of Soviet power tactics, and the rise and fall of

                        mounted steadily, hampering buildup of Western military defenses and
                        achievement of Free World unity on East-West problems. Widespread fear of
                        nuclear warfare, the burden of taxes for armaments, the economic effect of
                        the diversion and control of strategic materials, a general weariness with

                        for reunification, appeared to be the major sources of dissatisfaction
                        leading to neutralism. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> made a major

                        May 10 disarmament proposals have clearly impressed many important groups of
                        people in the non-Communist world. Combined with the new tone of
                        conciliation and reasonableness emanating from Moscow, such actions have
                        undoubtedly strengthened beliefs that either a new era has begun in the
                        Soviet Union since Stalin’s death, or that the Soviets were never quite so
                        evil as alleged.</p>
                    <p>The favorable impression created by the new Soviet tactics has increased the
                        difficulties faced by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in persuading
                        other peoples to accept American policies of building up Free World strength
                        to counter the threat posed by the massive military power of the Communist
                        bloc. As the Soviet posture appeared to grow less threatening, and the
                        danger of war seemed less immediate, it became increasingly difficult to
                        persuade Europeans that the necessary sacrifices <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                            facs="0561"/>demanded by our military counter-measures were a matter of
                        immediate urgency.</p>
                    <p>Although tensions in Europe began to relax in the early Spring of 1955, they
                        mounted sharply in the Far East, as a result of bellicose threats by Premier
                        Chou En-lai and the overt buildup of Communist military power on the
                        mainland opposite Formosa. A major war scare developed over the Formosa
                        Straits issue, which confronted <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        operations with psychological problems differing from area to area. A common
                        element in the varying reactions was the conviction that in a war with
                        Communist China the U.S. would resort to the use of atomic weapons. In the
                        Far East <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> was forced to deal with mixed
                        emotions regarding the use of atomic weapons against Asiatic peoples, and to
                        counter communist propaganda designed to stir up race hatred. To many
                        Europeans friendly to the U.S. the question of Quemoy and Matsu seemed
                        hardly worth launching an atomic war which might eventually involve them and
                        the entire world. In this situation Communist propaganda was increasingly
                        successful in conveying the impression that the U.S. was acting in an
                        unnecessarily belligerent manner.</p>
                    <p>It seems probable that the current Soviet conciliatory approach in its
                        relations with the Free World will continue for some time to come. We are
                        likely to be faced with a long series of conferences designed to settle
                        basic differences. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        has stated that the process of eliminating present differences with the
                        Soviets may take a long time. Under these circumstances it will be necessary
                        to continue to press for the maintenance of military strength in the Free
                        World. As international tensions are relaxed, however, it will become
                        increasingly difficult to persuade people abroad that current levels of
                        effort are necessary. In the case of the Soviet satellites, increased
                        friendly contacts between East and West will undoubtedly suggest abandonment
                        of their interests by the Free World. Should U.S. relations with Red China
                        develop along similar lines as those with the Soviet Union, we shall face
                        difficulties in convincing strongly anti-communist countries such as
                        Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines of the consistency of our policies,
                        while neutralist countries like India and Burma will press us for further
                        relaxation of tensions. It may be expected that such developments will pose
                        even more difficult psychological problems than in the past.</p>

                    <p>To provide policy direction to the Agency’s coverage of international
                        conferences, and to contribute its points of view toward achieving U.S.
                        purposes in the information field, agency policy officers were sent to
                        several international conferences. These included the Southeast Asia Treaty
                        Organization Conference in Bangkok, the U.N. Disarmament Commission
                        subcommittee meeting in London, the Austrian State Treaty Conference, the
                        4th Congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in
                        Vienna, the International Labor Office Conference in Geneva, and the 10th
                        Anniversary of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter signing in San
                        Francisco. Appropriate speeches, statements and actions of the U.S. and
                        foreign delegations to these and other international conferences were widely
                        distributed by all <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> media.</p>
                    <p>From the psychological viewpoint, a major event of the period under review
                        was the Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia (April 18–24). The
                        conference was of intense interest to the Near Eastern, African, and Asian
                        peoples, particularly because many of the 29 young nations were sending
                        delegations to their first international meeting. Despite the neutralist
                        auspices under which the conference was organized, <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss> early recognized the possibilities of encouraging and
                        strengthening the pro-Western delegations which were invited to attend.
                        Working closely with the State and other Agencies <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss> helped to prepare special materials for use by friendly
                        delegates. A few weeks before the conference it disseminated similar
                        material among the newspapers of the area. In Libya the <gloss

                        the briefing of the Libyan delegation to the conference.</p>
                    <p>Instead of the Bandung Conference’s becoming a neutralist or pro-Communist
                        vehicle for the condemnation of the Western powers, as many had feared, it
                        provided a forum in which a number of champions of democracy fearlessly
                        expressed their challenge to communism.</p>
                    <p>During the conference two <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        representatives helped to ensure that all pro-Western speeches received wide

                        participates. The projects completed during the period included symphony
                        orchestras, musical comedy groups, dramatic groups, athletic groups, and
                        individual artists. These were received with enthusiasm by foreign
                        audiences, who have given evidence of their recognition of the high cultural
                        achievement of the American people. Critical response abroad has included
                        references to the value of culture as a means of refuting Communist
                        propaganda and of developing deep understanding between peoples. It is
                        significant to note that several of the groups and some of the individual
                        artists were of the Negro race. The cultural attainments of these Negroes
                        were living proof to foreign audiences of the great progress achieved by the
                        race under the American democratic system.</p>

                        special film, photo and radio coverage; the purchase of tickets for
                        opinion-forming individuals and groups; and the travel of the artists to

                        since the local impresario was unwilling to undertake publicity because of
                        the anti-American sentiment which had been aroused over Cyprus.</p>
                    <p>The period ending June 30 showed an upswing in the cultural output of the

                        articles, news items, commentaries, exhibits, films and broadcasting. One

                        calls for a forceful and direct approach, avoiding a propagandistic or
                        strident tone. The USSR audience was afforded objective presentations
                        calculated to impress the listeners with the peaceful and constructive
                        purposes of U.S. policy, as well as to convince them of our sincere concern
                        for the welfare of the peoples of the USSR. The U.S. was portrayed as a
                        nation interested in assisting other peoples in solving their problems.
                        Thus, particular emphasis was given American leadership in promoting the
                        peaceful uses of the atom. Wherever possible, in conjunction with <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505/1, advantage was taken of Soviet
                        vulnerabilities. Exploitation of such situations as the deposition of
                        Malenkov, the about-face with regard to the “New Economic Course,” the
                        stagnation of Soviet agriculture, and the reduction in the rate of
                        productivity was for the most part effected through objective
                        discussions.</p>

                    <p>In connection with the preparations for the meeting at the Summit, output
                        placed great stress upon statements made by the President and other
                        responsible Government officials assuring the USSR of American readiness to
                        consider concrete proposals, which did not violate our basic principles, for
                        the reduction of international tensions.</p>
                    <p>Information programs directed to the satellite countries continued to
                        emphasize (a) that the U.S. cannot reconcile itself to continued Soviet
                        domination of the nations of Eastern Europe, such domination being a cause
                        of tension; (b) that the U.S. desires the restoration of true liberty to
                        that area so that the captive satellite peoples may again enjoy governments
                        and institutions of their own choosing; and (c) that increased Western
                        strength as exemplified by the Paris agreements has significance for the
                        future of Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>Soviet agreement to the Austrian State Treaty, which entailed abandonment of
                        the Soviet position on several issues, was presented essentially as Soviet
                        recognition of the position of strength developed by the Western powers. The
                        Bulganin-Krushchev visit to Belgrade and the joint declaration which
                        recognized the possibility of achieving “socialism” in diverse ways, was
                        presented as a “Canossa”. The Kremlin’s respect for Yugoslavia’s independent
                        course of action was underlined with the suggestion that this Soviet
                        accommodation to Tito may have ramifications of significance to the peoples
                        of the satellite states.</p>
                    <p>In compliance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives, and as
                        opportunities permitted, American interest in the welfare of the satellite
                        population was demonstrated. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                        known to the peoples of Eastern Europe. The ouster of Malenkov, and

                        in Hungary, as well as the abandonment of the New Economic Course, were
                        utilized to express concern over the inability of the communist regimes to
                        meet consumer needs, and to solve the critical problem of adequate
                        agricultural production.</p>
                    <p>Identification of the satellites issue as a basic cause of international
                        tension was emphasized throughout the pre-Geneva period, together with the
                        conviction that an enduring peace could not be achieved without a just
                        solution to the satellites issue.</p>
                    <p>To carry out basic <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives aimed at
                        weakening ties between individual communist governments and the USSR,
                        Operation Discord was developed further with a view to promoting friction in
                        Communist China–USSR relations. Output to the Chinese mainland was keyed
                        toward creating distrust of the Soviet Union <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536"
                            facs="0566"/>and toward encouraging a dislike for communist leadership
                        and policies. An effort was made to build the belief that values embraced by
                        the U.S. and other free nations offer a better way than communism to peace,
                        progress and human welfare. To date VOA has been the sole medium for
                        reaching Communist China.</p>

                        obtained in interviews with escapees were issued. Media, notably the press
                        and radio services, were enjoined to make use of escapee interviews,
                        particularly with escapees successfully resettled to a constructive life in
                        the Free World.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets and satellites launched a massive information campaign to
                        discredit the escapee program and to induce escapees to return to their
                        homeland. To counter the threat which this campaign poses, steps were taken
                        to expose the true purposes of the Communists in this regard, by explaining
                        the problems and the accomplishments of the West in dealing with East
                        European refugees. Soviet bloc “redefection” efforts continue to grow in
                        scope and intensity.</p>

                        engaged in systematic efforts to strengthen and enlarge information
                        penetration of the Soviet orbit. These efforts have expressed themselves in
                        the form of more effective utilization of means currently at our disposal,
                        and in the development of additional ways and means of penetrating both the
                        USSR and the Soviet satellite states. The more noteworthy of these projects
                        are: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        contributing to the Communist decision to postpone the opening of the Peace

                    <p>A mobile “Atoms for Peace” exhibit completed a year-long tour in Italy after

                        another Agency exhibit in Vienna within a three-week period. This same
                        exhibit is now on tour in Germany. In Spain a special exhibit was prepared
                        for showing at the Valencia and Barcelona Trade Fairs. A mobile exhibit
                        similar to the Italian model was inaugurated in The Hague and subsequently
                        shown in six major Dutch cities. This exhibit was adapted for showing in

                    <p>The assignment of a Special Information Officer to London resulted in
                        increased use of U.S. materials by Far and Near East journalists and by
                        British publications going to those areas. Reuter’s News Agency agreed to
                        accept a large amount of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> press output
                        for weekly service to the Far and Near East.</p>
                    <p>With the signing of the Austrian state treaty May 15, the primary objective
                        in Austria—to maintain pressure on the Soviets to agree to a treaty on just
                        terms—was achieved. Following the treaty signing plans were made to adapt
                        the program in Austria from one supporting occupation policies to one suited
                        to information activities in a small neutral country on the Soviet
                        periphery. The U.S. weekly newspaper <hi rend="italic">Wiener Kurier</hi>
                        was terminated at the end of the reporting period and arrangements were made
                        for turning over the U.S. radio station in Vienna to the Austrian
                        Broadcasting System once the treaty becomes effective.</p>
                    <p>The emphasis on pinpointing programs in Western Europe required some
                        organizational changes. Two officers were assigned to a new branch post in
                        Trieste as a result of increased communist activity in the area. The country
                        post in Algiers was placed under jurisdiction of <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss>–France in recognition of the increasing importance of
                        Algeria’s role in current French affairs and the consequent necessity for a
                        coordinated French and Algerian information program. Two new information
                        centers near U.S. air bases in Zaragoza and Cadiz were opened in support of
                        other U.S. Government agencies responsible for economic and military aid
                        programs in Spain. The Agency also opened a new branch post in Tours,
                        France, in order to further <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> objectives
                        in the crucial areas of Normandy and Brittany.</p>
                    <p>In recognition of the continued influence and prestige of the Swiss press
                        throughout the world, which includes circulation within several Iron Curtain
                        countries, the Agency re-established the position of Public Affairs Officer
                        in Berne. His primary assignment is to establish personal contact with key
                        editors and publishers throughout Switzerland and to supply them with

                        mainly at East Pakistan, to increase awareness among the people of the
                        dangers of communism and the positive contributions being made by the
                        government, with U.S. aid, to the welfare of the people and the economic
                        stability of the country. This expansion was made possible by the
                        reprogramming of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> funds and the

                        where we had diplomatic or consular posts. Reports that <gloss

                        Indian government prompted this move. Our Ambassador’s emphatic denial of
                        these reports was not contested, and the Indian government’s request was not
                        further pressed. Meanwhile, the “Atoms for Peace” exhibit toured the main
                        cities of India with marked success. Prime Minister Nehru visited the
                        exhibit when it was in New Delhi and showed a genuine interest in details of
                        the display.</p>
                    <p>Unsettled conditions arising from the dispute between Pakistan and
                        Afghanistan caused the cancellation of the “Atoms for Peace” exhibit in
                        Kabul. The program in Afghanistan moved ahead in another direction, however,
                        with the opening of a reading and recreation room for youth through
                        arrangements with the Afghanistan Olympics Association.</p>

                    <p>The visit of the Shah of Iran to the United States from December to February
                        provided an opportunity to strengthen the concept of the Shah as a

                        Truce Supervisory Office, in his efforts to bring about agreements on

                        pamphlets, and information center activities, the Damascus post brought to

                        anti-Communist attitudes among the intellectual and labor leaders of the
                        non-Communist left.</p>
                    <p>Editorial opinion favorable to U.S. policy was developed in important
                        Japanese publications through personal contact. Although the national press
                        remained generally unreceptive to explanatory material on U.S. policy and
                        Communism, a remarkable placement of material on the peaceful uses of atomic
                        energy was achieved. Construction of a major atomic energy exhibit was
                        begun, and the program aimed at labor was expanded.</p>
                    <p>In the anti-Communist program … pamphlets were distributed through friendly
                        labor and student groups. On May Day, Tokyo students for the first time
                        distributed anti-Communist pamphlets produced with <gloss target="#t_USIA1"

                        feature films for early commercial release.</p>
                    <p>Unparalleled enthusiasm, admiration and good will were produced throughout
                        Japan by the tour of the Symphony of the Air, made under joint <gloss

                    <p>Since the Republic of Korea continued to give only limited cooperation to the
                        U.S. assistance program, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, without
                        affronting the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government, undertook
                        heavy exploitation of the program through all media, but most affectively
                        through locally produced documentary films. The <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss> role in exploiting U.S. assistance was expanded with the
                        absorption of the Korean Civil Assistance Command information program after
                        its liquidation by the military command. The KCAC program functioned to
                        publicize reconstruction and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> assumed
                        both its information responsibilities and most of its physical plant.
                        Operations are conducted principally through mobile unit programs using
                        pamphlets, posters and films.</p>
                    <p>The Philippine program concentrated on increasing Philippine understanding of
                        U.S. policy, especially with regard to Formosa, Vietnam and Southeast Asian
                        collective defense. Advice and material support continued to be extended to
                        the government’s anti-Huk campaign and new emphasis was given to the
                        dissemination of information to acquaint the Filipinos with the dangers of
                        Communist infiltration. To increase recognition of the Philippines and
                        enhance its reputation abroad, Philippine assistance to Vietnam in
                        “Operation Brotherhood” was fully reported by film and press coverage, and
                        two films were produced illustrating Philippine participation in the Manila
                        Pact.</p>
                    <p>On Formosa, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> undertook support of a
                        morale-building program of troop information and education instituted by the
                            <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the Nationalist Government
                        following signature of the defense treaty with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>U.S. support and assistance to the Republic of China continued to be the main
                        theme of the Formosa program. Activities aimed at overseas Chinese included
                        establishment of a magazine to publicize Nationalist accomplishments in
                        Southeast Asia, material assistance to Taiwan University students in
                        publication of a student newspaper to counter the attractions of mainland
                        education, and participation with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> and
                        the Asia Foundation in an expansion of Taiwan University facilities to
                        attract more overseas students.</p>
                    <p>Provinces in the north and south of Thailand were saturated during the period
                        in separate operations of the anti-Communist indoctrination program. In
                        June, a similar program was begun with the Thai armed forces. A newly
                        developed positive approach, focusing <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544"
                            facs="0574"/>on the benefits of democracy as an alternative to Communism
                        and the concern of the Thai government for the national welfare, has been
                        instituted. The effectiveness of the program is manifest in widespread mass
                        meetings, parades, editorial comment and official pronouncements denouncing
                        Communism. A particularly significant development has been the participation
                        of hitherto apolitical Buddhist priests in the program.</p>
                    <p>While official Burmese neutralism continued, a relaxation of government
                        attitudes and an improvement in internal security enabled <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> to disseminate large quantities of
                        anti-Communist material in formerly inaccessible areas. Negotiations for
                        establishment of a post of Moulmein were not completed during the period but
                        favorable Foreign Office action is expected soon. A temporary book pavilion
                        near the University of Rangoon is planned to counteract Communist influence
                        among students.</p>
                    <p>Despite the recurring political crises that hindered rehabilitation and
                        reconstruction in Vietnam, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> exploited
                        the dramatic refugee flight from North Vietnam as the chief means of
                        focusing internal and international attention on the growing effectiveness
                        of the Diem government, and terrorism and duplicity of the Communist
                        Vietminh regime in North Vietnam. The refugee story, told by all Media and
                        with particular impact by locally produced newsreels and documentary films,
                        served to expose Communist violations of the Geneva truce, to present a
                        picture of the rigors of life in North Vietnam under Communism, to draw
                        attention to the accomplishments of the government in the South in terms of
                        its ability to resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees, and to highlight
                        the moral and material assistance given Vietnam by the U.S. and other free
                        nations to help the Vietnamese maintain their freedom and achieve national
                        aspirations.</p>
                    <p>Special efforts were made in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to stimulate
                        increased activity by indigenous civil and military information agencies to
                        provide auxiliaries to <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> operations. The
                        most notable achievement was the Laotian Army’s active use of the advice and
                        assistance provided as a corollary to the stimulus to form mobile military
                        information teams that carry <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> material
                        to areas beyond the reach or resources of <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss>. The propaganda efforts of the 17 Laotian and <gloss

                        produced newsreels and documentaries promoting Laotian unity and popular
                        support for the government. In the period before national elections, leading
                        political figures accompany the mobile teams when possible, acting as
                        government interlocutors.</p>
                    <p>Field centers were established in provincial capitals as central points for
                        the dissemination of propaganda; traveling entertainers were used as
                        propagandists; facilities for the distribution of films <pb n="545"
                            xml:id="pg_545" facs="0575"/>were increased. These new activities were
                        designed to increase propaganda penetration in support of objectives,
                        particularly in rural areas where poor communications and contact make it
                        difficult to contest the propaganda of Communist agents effectively.</p>

                        continued to be centered on the priority countries of Brazil, Chile,
                        Bolivia, Mexico, Guatemala and Argentina. At the same time, in order to
                        develop new capabilities in all countries and to strengthen cultural
                        activities, measured expansion of the binational center program was
                        undertaken: to date, new centers have been founded in seven countries.
                        Sub-posts, staffed by local employees, were established in British Guiana
                        and Barbados, and plans were completed for a one-man post in Jamaica. A
                        Portuguese version of the daily Wireless File was introduced as the core of
                        an effort to increase U.S. influence on the Brazilian press.</p>
                    <p>The task of modifying the nationalistic and Marxist economic attitudes, which
                        in many of the Latin American countries present a serious obstacle to U.S.
                        objectives, became a part of the program, with the major share of attention
                        devoted to exposition of the free enterprise system and the theme of
                        inter-American economic interdependence. The “economic information” program,
                        begun a year ago, was further developed with the publication in
                        local-language versions of eight important books, production of numerous
                        dramatic and commentary radio programs on economic themes, the release of a
                        major film on hemisphere interdependence, and the distribution of a large
                        volume of press material. Production began on a series of roundtable TV
                        programs on which there will be frequent discussion of economic
                        principles.</p>
                    <p>As an integral part of this effort, informational support of <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> programs were focussed upon self-help,
                        community effort, and the concept of U.S.-Latin American “partners in
                        progress”. Three color films on the achievements of U.S. technical
                        cooperation in Peru were completed. Also four short films on <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> activities in Brazil. Short sequences on
                            <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> programs were inserted in Brazilian
                        commercial newsreels.</p>
                    <p>The economic aspect of U.S.-Latin American relations, especially those
                        related to policies enunciated at the Rio Economic Conference, received
                        constant treatment in all media. The Private Investment <pb n="546"

                        the Agency not only for its good will significance, but especially in an
                        economic context.<note n="25" xml:id="d190fn25">Vice President <persName

                            March 6. The Vice President’s report on the trip is in Department of

                            587-594.</note> A film on the visit was afterwards distributed in the
                        countries concerned, a shorter sequence having previously been inserted in
                        commercial newsreels; and a pamphlet entitled “The Americas”, stressing
                        economic development, was issued in an edition of 115,750 copies. The
                        Vice-President’s recommendations concerning the Inter-American Highway were
                        repeatedly used to keynote informative comment on the economic
                        potentialities of that enterprise.</p>
                    <p>As the offshore fishing rights issue, involving Ecuador, Peru, and Chile,
                        assumed increasing importance, the Agency began a campaign to explain the
                        U.S. position and to focus public attention as much as possible on the need
                        for conservation of fisheries, rather than “defense of sovereignty.” Feature
                        stories, technical background information, radio programs and taped
                        interviews are being used to this end. Three issues of the monthly “Our
                        Times” documentary newsreel carried footage on the Conservation Congress in
                        Rome in which the U.S. viewpoint has expounded.</p>
                    <p>Special work to reduce resistance to U.S. economic policy was carried on in
                        three of the priority countries. In Brazil, this took the form of carefully
                        guarded activity to build opinion favoring foreign aid in the development of
                        natural resources, notably petroleum. The project utilizes such open means
                        as the recording of a discussion of U.S. technical assistance in Brazil’s
                        petroleum development, held in this country by the director of Petrobas; but
                        relies mainly on the placement of non-U.S… . material and the
                        cross-reporting of useful matter from other countries. Data thus provided
                        has strengthened the hand of the important Chateaubriand newspapers, which
                        advocate repeal of Brazil’s present restrictive legislation. In Chile, where
                        the main effort of the information program has been to overcome unreasonable
                        resentment of the U.S. as the author of Chile’s economic ills, the very bad
                        climate of last year has begun to yield to more responsible press treatment
                        of economic problems. In Argentina, despite the unavailability of normal
                        informational channels, a fairly steady flow of material arguing the
                        relation of free enterprise and private investment to progress has been
                        circulated to opinion-makers by means of mailing lists and the periodical
                        press, including the Agency’s locally produced magazines.</p>
                    <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0577"/>
                    <p>In coordination with the Department of State and other interested agencies,
                        effective work was accomplished in exposing the Communist direction of three
                        congresses. The first, a youth “festival”, was denied authorization by the
                        Governments of Chile and Brazil; the second, a teachers’ congress, was
                        postponed, apparently indefinitely, after being denounced by several
                        governments. Plans for the third, a “civil liberties” congress in Chile,
                        were at least temporarily disrupted when non-Communist students federations
                        withdrew as a direct result of U.S. informational efforts.</p>
                    <p>In Mexico, pamphlets, books, films, and personal contacts were used to
                        accelerate the trend of the major Mexican labor federations towards
                        aggressive anti-Communist action, and to further the impact of this highly
                        important movement upon labor and liberal opinion throughout Central
                        America. A project involving the cooperation of Mexican officials was
                        instituted for the purpose of disseminating constructive ideological
                        materials through the Mexican school system. Plans were also laid for using
                        indigenous channels to expose the subversive influence of Communists in
                        public posts.</p>
                    <p>In order to combat continuing liberal and leftist propaganda against the new
                        Government of Guatemala, advantage was taken of all newsworthy events
                        connected with that country as an excuse to recall the damage done there by
                        the previous pro-Communist regime and to emphasize current progress towards
                        democracy. Inside Guatemala, radio programs, traveling exhibits, press and
                        pamphlets materials, and films were used to re-educate those sectors
                        formerly most exposed to Communist propaganda and to encourage confidence in
                        the present, middle-of-the-road government. Agency officers assisted the
                        government in arranging the first national teachers’ conference ever held in
                        Guatemala, aided the authorities in the work of eliminating Communist,
                        textbooks, and launched a seminar for normal school teachers, designed to
                        attract educators to the Binational Center. A film on Vice-President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s visit, “Guatemala Makes a
                        Friend”, was produced and shown throughout the country, and a film
                        illustrating a year of progress under freedom was made and released for
                        commercial showing on the anniversary of the 1954 revolution; a shorter
                        version of the latter will be distributed throughout Latin America.</p>
                    <p>Response in Latin America to materials circulated in support of the
                        President’s “Atoms for Peace” program prompted the conclusion that this
                        theme constitutes the most inspirational expression of U.S. leadership that
                        has been formulated in many years. Press, radio, and motion picture
                        materials available in the field were steadily augmented and increased
                        publicity was built upon the visits of Latin American journalists and
                        students to atomic installations in this country. The massive exhibit on
                        “Atoms for the Benefit of Man-kind” <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0578"

                        than 500,000 persons. In Honduras and in Guadalajara, Mexico, “atomic
                        information weeks” were staged.</p>
                    <p>Following the Pan American Games in Mexico, to which heavy media-wide
                        coverage was given as a means of dramatizing the solidarity and democratic
                        values of the Western Hemisphere, U.S. track and swimming stars carried out
                        an extremely effective tour of Central American countries, financed by the

                        supported were a tour by a ranking team of musicians, the visit of a girls’

                        U.S. information programs. Certain results of the Summit meetings, however,
                        are clearly of direct significance to American information activities. The

                            <item>An atmosphere of conciliation was created at Geneva resulting from
                                the generally friendly tone struck by all participants, and the
                                repeated stress on the urgency of international cooperation if a
                                durable peace is to be achieved. In the eyes of the world, the
                                United States emerged from the Summit Conference more clearly as a
                                country dedicated to the earnest pursuit of peaceful solutions to
                                international problems, sincerely willing to cooperate to this end
                                even with the present rulers of the Soviet Union. This has been well
                                received by most of our allies and friends in the free world, except
                                for Nationalist China and Korea, but has had discouraging
                                implications for our friends in the satellites. For many of our
                                audiences, the basic implication is that, unless and until the “acid
                                test” of forth-coming negotiations should prove otherwise, the
                                United States does not intend to question Soviet intentions in
                                seeking peaceful solutions to East-West problems.</item>

                            <item>At Geneva the Heads of Government of the Four Powers instructed
                                their Foreign Ministers to undertake further discussions on a number
                                of questions, beginning in October. Meanwhile, various disarmament
                                proposals made at Geneva are to be given consideration by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Disarmament Subcommittee, which will
                                reconvene August 29. These forthcoming discussions will presumably
                                be initiated in the tone of conciliation struck at the Summit
                                meetings. The fact that these discussions are scheduled in itself
                                places a responsibility upon the U.S. Government information
                                programs to avoid actions which in the eyes of the world might
                                detract from the strong moral position achieved by the United States
                                at Geneva. This must be kept in mind while carrying out the further
                                responsibility of bringing pressure upon the Soviets, in advance of
                                the October meeting so as either to induce them to make substantive
                                concessions or make clear to the world their unwillingness to do
                                so.</item>

                            <item>Despite their friendly tone at Geneva, Soviet leaders have as yet
                                given no public evidence of their willingness to yield on any
                                substantive issue brought up at Geneva. This fact is most obvious to
                                our satellite audiences. The grip of the Soviet Union on its
                                satellite empire remains firm; Soviet leaders have, in effect,
                                publicly indicated that they do not at this time intend to
                                relinquish effective control of the captive territories or peoples.
                                Internal popular opposition to industrial and agricultural controls,
                                combined with the new Soviet <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0580"
                                />tolerance of the Titoist “heresy,” may well present the Soviet
                                regime with increased difficulties. But the military forces of the
                                Soviet-Communist bloc and the conspiratorial apparatus of
                                international communism still represent an undiminished threat of
                                great magnitude to the free world. Even though tensions which might
                                lead to war in the near future have been relaxed, we can expect that
                                communist tactics of subversion, economic penetration, insidious
                                propaganda and political agitation will continue unabated. It is
                                important therefore that superficial and possibly even a few
                                substantial concessions which might be made at the subsequent
                                conferences, be not looked upon as proof that the Soviet intentions
                                have undergone any fundamental change.</item>

                            <item><p>Expert opinion is agreed that the morale of the captive peoples
                                    has probably deteriorated as an aftermath of Geneva. Satellite
                                    populations placed exaggerated hopes in the Geneva meetings, and
                                    wishfully looked for some evidence of Soviet yielding to the
                                    West. They undoubtedly have received an over-simplified
                                    impression of the readiness of the United States to cooperate
                                    with the present Soviet leaders, which will tend to increase
                                    feelings of hopelessness with regard to their eventual
                                    liberation from communism. This impression will give support to
                                    communist propaganda efforts to convince the Eastern European
                                    peoples that they cannot hope for effective intervention by the
                                    West.</p>
                                <p>In the absence of any new evidence to the contrary, satellite
                                    peoples are apt to regard the apparent American acceptance of
                                    Soviet good faith either as political naivete, or as a first
                                    step toward abandonment of their interests. They are likely to
                                    feel that the manner in which the satellite question was dealt
                                    with at Geneva (including the failure of the British and French
                                    to support the President’s initiative) was weak and unconvincing
                                    in contrast to the strong and united Western position on German
                                    reunification. Latent suspicions regarding the sincerity of
                                    professed Western intentions to bring about the liberation of
                                    Eastern Europe have therefore probably been strengthened by
                                    developments at the Summit meetings. Perhaps the most
                                    significant aspect of Geneva for the captive peoples is the
                                    clear and unmistakable evidence that the Western powers, even
                                    the United States, will not resort to war, or threat of war, to
                                    liberate Eastern Europe. The resultant loss of hope, however
                                    unrealistic, for early liberation, by force if necessary, which
                                    is still widely held among the captive populations will
                                    undoubtedly lead to weakening of the spirit of resistance.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, Western proposals at Geneva for wider exchange
                                    of ideas, publications and persons, offer a possible new
                                    approach to the satellite peoples. This approach would have to
                                    be combined with strong reassertions that political freedom and
                                    national <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0581"/>independence
                                    must be restored to Eastern European countries. Precise and
                                    imaginative proposals for breaking down the isolation of the
                                    Eastern European peoples could be used to induce a gradual
                                    relaxation of communist controls, and to reduce the severity of
                                    the pressures now exercised upon individuals.</p>
                                <p>Any official exchange program would risk suggesting that the U.S.
                                    is reconciled to the status quo and is willing to confer
                                    respectability upon puppet leaders. Consequently such a program
                                    would have to be carefully presented to satellite audiences so
                                    as to avoid such an impression. But it would appear that the
                                    West stands to gain from wider circulation of Western ideas,
                                    books, magazines and newspapers, and from any reduction of radio
                                    jamming by the communists. A wider exchange of persons, however,
                                    has some risks. Satellite exchangees undoubtedly would be
                                    handpicked by the communist regimes, and for the most part,
                                    consist of hard core activists. Nonetheless, it might be
                                    possible to circumvent intentions of the communist regimes by
                                    such proposals as the exchange of visits by relatives or other
                                    groups which would be technically difficult to pack with
                                    agents.</p>

                            <item>At Geneva it was asserted that the U.S. regards international
                                communism as a major source of tension and that the Soviet Union is
                                in a position to reduce this tension. Since Geneva there has been no
                                indication that the conspiratorial activities of international
                                communism have been reduced in any significant way, or that the
                                leaders of the Soviet Union have ceased to exercise effective
                                control over the international communist movement.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>As long as this situation continues, we cannot relax our efforts to combat
                        international communism with all effective means at our disposal, and to
                        make clear Soviet responsibility for communist efforts at subversion,
                        dissension and disorder throughout the world. Here a genuine dilemma arises,
                        at least for official U.S. information media. If we are to be realistic
                        about the source and control of the world-wide communist conspiracy, we
                        cannot avoid tracing responsibility to the Soviet Union, and in certain
                        contexts, to individual leaders of the Soviet Union—<hi rend="italic">with
                            whom we shall he negotiating over the next few months</hi>. To what
                        extent can the aims, motives and operations of international communism be
                        attacked and questioned, without reflecting on the good faith and intentions
                        of individual Soviet leaders? The question of Soviet good faith and the aim
                        of international communism to dominate the world cannot be realistically
                        separated. To resort to euphemisms and circumlocutions in treating the
                        problem of ultimate responsibility can only result in a note of hypocrisy,
                        which our audiences will be quick to recognize.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps this dilemma can be partly obviated by directing our efforts at
                        inducing the Soviet leaders first to disavow publicly any <pb n="552"
                            xml:id="pg_552" facs="0582"/>connection with international communist
                        subversion and then to condemn such activities.</p>
                    <p>Because Soviet leaders must, if confronted with the question, disavow any
                        official connection with the whole field of international communist
                        conspiracy and subversion, the dilemma referred to above may be more
                        apparent than real, since, if the Soviet leaders disavow such activities,
                        they cannot take umbrage at public attacks against those activities.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, too much to expect that we could induce the Soviet leaders
                        to condemn, as distinct from disavowing, publicly communist subversion, but
                        there would be value in obtaining their disavowal, even though patently
                        false, of any connection with international communist subversion. Their mere
                        disavowal of connection with the international conspiracy would, since world
                        public opinion knows they are directly responsible for such conspiracy,
                        condition public opinion to demand more from the Soviet leaders than words
                        on the substantive issues at the October meeting. Furthermore, their refusal
                        or failure to condemn communist subversive activities would tend to become a
                        glaring fact which could be widely exploited.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Proposed Lines of Approach</hi></p>
                    <p>The various considerations treated above emphasize the need for making the
                        position of the United States clear to the satellite peoples as we approach
                        the forthcoming meetings. Briefly, we do not consider that the relaxation of
                        tension and a more peaceful atmosphere permit us either to scrap programs
                        for individual and collective self defense, or to tolerate covert aggression
                        and to sanctify the injustices of the status quo. Rather the spirit of
                        Geneva means an opportunity for peaceful change which will dispel fear and
                        remedy injustices. Therefore, if the atmosphere of Geneva is perverted by
                        the Soviet leaders either into a cover for covert aggression, or into an
                        excuse for perpetuating present injustices either at home or in the captive
                        countries, then that atmosphere cannot continue.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, at this moment in history, we cannot afford to appear, in
                        the eyes of the world, as condemning all offers of the Soviet Union even
                        before testing for sincerity. We should emphasize the positive aspects of
                        U.S. policies. We should not emphasize direct charges and allegations
                        against the Soviet Union, but rather we should make such points by
                            indirection.<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">At the suggestion of the

                        reflect the fact that the U.S. reciprocates the present Soviet attitude and
                        demeanor of conciliation. But we should make clear that a continuation of
                        the present atmosphere depends upon Soviet and satellite actions which
                        clearly show their willingness to bring about a peaceful change. This means
                        the elimination of the present injustices under which the captive peoples
                        suffer, and the curbing of the conspiratorial activities of international

                        namely that Soviet domination of the peoples of Eastern Europe is one of the
                        major sources of East-West tension, and that the continuation of this
                        control obstructs the achievement of genuine peace. We hold that the captive
                        peoples must be given political freedom and national independence. A high
                        level statement, preferably by the President, should be used on some
                        appropriate occasion in the near future to reaffirm this position clearly
                        and strongly, and to point up the fact that at Geneva the United States did
                        not acquiesce in the status quo in Eastern Europe.<note n="3"

                        unfavorably, on internal developments in satellite countries, such as the

                        We may utilize anniversaries of past Soviet actions, such as the

                        to point up past communist duplicity and ultimate Soviet responsibility for
                        the imposition of an alien rule upon unwilling Eastern European peoples.
                        This should be done without engaging in polemics, name-calling or personal

                        satellite regimes take a more conciliatory approach in East-West relations,
                        or should they relax oppressive controls over their people, such moves
                        should be welcomed as essential first steps, and further steps in this

                        come anywhere near satisfying the legitimate spiritual and material demands
                        of the satellite peoples, and that much more can and should be done.</p>

                        watched as a barometer of Soviet real intentions. This note of expectancy on

                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> circular Infoguide
                                entitled “Post-Geneva Approach of <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                    >USIS</gloss>.” The basic instruction was as follows: “Looking
                                forward to upcoming Soviet-Free World meetings, and to a possibly
                                long period of détente and negotiation, all media should orient
                                their output to four basic points of US information policy: l) The
                                US is actively pursuing goals which reflect a dynamic, constructive
                                concept of <hi rend="italic">peaceful change</hi> leading to a more
                                stable, fruitful and secure future for mankind; 2) We cannot
                                therefore accept a frozen status quo, which sanctions present
                                injustices and inequities for hundreds of millions of human beings;
                                3) The kind of peace we desire—the product of understanding and
                                agreement and law among nations—requires positive cooperative effort
                                on the part of all those persons and nations who assert that they
                                desire peace; 4) Only as genuine, constructive action on the part of
                                the Soviets replaces hostility and subversion can the need for the
                                military safeguards against aggression so laboriously built up by
                                the free world be reduced.” (Washington National Records Center,

                        step to very substantially increase what we are doing in the whole area of
                        overseas information and contacts—the exchange of ideas and people.</p>
                    <p>The whole level of this activity has been too low, when you consider that it
                        holds within it the potential <hi rend="italic">to destroy the opposition’s

                        presents us with an opportunity to assume the initiative, and press for a
                        breakthrough.</p>
                    <p>We have in mind an important Presidential speech or message to come
                        immediately after the Foreign Ministers’ Geneva meeting, where agreement and
                        progress on this agenda item are virtually certain. The speech would
                        underscore U.S. sincerity by calling for a greatly expanded effort, both
                        governmental and private, to create worldwide understanding of U.S. aims and
                        help build the climate for enduring peace.</p>
                    <p>This new “Program for World Understanding” should at least <hi rend="italic"
                            >double</hi> what the Government is now doing. The present level is <pb
                            n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0587"/>roughly $163 million: made up of
                        Exchange of Persons in State, $18 million; Exchange of technical personnel
                        in <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, $55 million; The President’s Fund

                    <p>The new level recommended by the President would be in the neighborhood of
                        $325 million: with at least $100 million for all exchange of persons
                        programs; $210 million for <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>; and $15
                        million for the President’s Fund.</p>
                    <p>Together with a Presidential appeal to all individual Americans and groups to
                        take part in the new Program, this action would ensure that everything
                        possible is done to increase the flow abroad of people, ideas, books,
                        magazines, newspapers, films, broadcasts, television, exhibits, cultural
                        presentations, trade fair exhibitions, sports teams, technical groups, and
                        delegations of all kinds … all designed to increase understanding, further
                        ease tensions, and promote enduring peace.</p>
                    <p>The speech or message might include these points: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“An aircraft carrier of the Forrestal class costs over $200 million
                                to construct. It is necessary. We must have it and other powerful
                                ships and bombers for our defense. But $325 million for this
                                post-Geneva work is equally important, particularly if it can bring
                                us one step closer to genuine understanding between our people and
                                the other peoples of the world.</p>
                            <p>“The Geneva meetings hold out hope in this regard. So also do the

                            <p>“We must have much more of all these things—because they will
                                contribute to the climate in which a permanent peace will eventually

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: This is by way of report to you
                        that following our conference in your office on August 31,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d193fn2">The only memorandum in Department of State files on the
                            August 31 meeting was a note of September 1 from Assistant Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_MCCW1">McCardle</persName>, marked “Personal
                            for the Secretary.” It reads as follows:<p>“I could not help getting the
                                feeling in the meeting with Streibert yesterday that they are
                                rushing into the Cold War too fast just because Russia is smiling. I
                                think that Streibert may have gained the impression that he had a
                                green light really to change the nature of his operations and was,
                                indeed, anticipating for himself policy matters which properly
                                should be left to the State Department. He seemed to be enchanted by
                                the Soviet smile. I think that you will agree that much more work
                                has to be done to make that smile into a reality.” (<hi

                        persons and ideas.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">According to the President’s

                    <p>I went over the attached memorandum with him.<note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4">See

                    <p>It was the President’s view that we should plan ahead for whatever increases
                        can effectively help us clarify the peaceful objectives of the United States
                        to the world’s peoples and build on the foundations laid at Geneva. I told
                        him of your suggestion that there be stimulated the maximum help from
                        non-Government private sources, with which he fully agreed.</p>
                    <p>The exact budgetary level of the new program will, of course, be determined
                        by what we believe we can effectively accomplish. We are at work on this
                        now. I have discussed the subject with <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herb

                            his disapproval of Streibert’s proposals. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> wrote that he had told Streibert that any

                            should be judged on their own merits, and that the whole proposition
                            would have to be discussed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>

                            follows: “My first reaction to the proposal is not favorable—it smacks
                            too much of the shotgun, grandiose spending of money for spending’s sake
                            … . I think that one point that this program emphasizes has been our own
                            lack of leadership and policy direction over <gloss target="#t_USIA1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> explained that the guidance set forth in
                        the reference report had already been put into effect and that the results
                        showed that the paper had been effective and realistic. He pointed out that
                        he had checked with the President at Denver and had secured his approval of
                        the proposed guidance before the President’s illness.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d194fn3">The President had suffered a heart attack.</note> The
                        President had been inclined to feel that we should take a more positive
                        attitude toward the Soviet Union than the original draft had suggested and
                        had, accordingly, dictated himself the second paragraph of Section III
                        which, as changed by the President, read as follows: “On the other hand, at
                        this moment in history, we cannot afford to appear, in the eyes of the
                        world, as condemning all offers of the Soviet Union even before testing for
                        sincerity. We should emphasize the positive aspects of U.S. policy. We
                        should not emphasize the direct charges and allegations against the Soviet
                        Union, but rather we should make such points by indirection.”</p>
                    <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0591"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> then went on to say that the meat of his
                        paper was to be found in the sections in which we continued to restate our
                        basic U.S. position on the satellites and our continued offensive against
                        international Communism. After summarizing the appropriate paragraphs, Mr.
                            <persName>Streibert</persName> pointed out that there had been no letup
                        in our continued offensive against international Communism. We also
                        continued to connect this movement with the Kremlin itself.</p>
                    <p>Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> was co-author
                        of this paper, Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> suggested that he might
                        have a few comments to make.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he was
                        inclined to fear that current Soviet activities were more insidious and more
                        difficult to combat than they had been before the Geneva Heads-of-Government
                        meeting last July. He was accordingly somewhat concerned about the line
                        taken in the paragraph referred to earlier which had been dictated by the
                        President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also pointed
                        out that there was a covert annex to the present paper which, if the Vice
                        President agreed, he would present to the Operations Coordinating Board next
                        week. The line followed in the covert report was harsher than the line to be
                        used in overt media.<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">Not found in Department of

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Nelson Rockefeller</persName> strongly
                        supported the views of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> as to the increasing danger of Soviet propaganda and
                        inquired why we could not ourselves use the Soviet method of charging that
                        certain actions taken by the United States were contrary to the “Spirit of
                        Geneva”.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that of course the Soviet aim was to try to force us
                        to change our policies by invoking the “Spirit of Geneva”. It might,
                        accordingly, be a wise move to see whether in point of fact we are making
                        changes in our policies to suit the convenience of the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>Once again the President was eloquent in behalf of the information program.
                        He said, “I sincerely want to ask for more money for this work—a 50%
                        increase.”</p>
                    <p>He again spoke of the change in the type of Soviet attack. It is now more in
                        the economic area and in the area of propaganda.</p>
                    <p>He spoke about the United States early trials and errors in this field—how we
                        had to jump into it on an emergency basis to fight the Communist
                        propaganda—how there were many wrong people who got into the work and how
                        there were many inefficient and ill-considered programs.</p>
                    <p>However, that is all different now. We have learned a great deal in this
                        work. Streibert has made it efficient and given it very thorough going
                        direction. He has gone into all the different types of programs, the
                        President said: radio, films, publications and all the rest. There are
                        always going to be things to find fault with in this type of endeavor, but
                        by and large we are ready now to step it up significantly.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized how important an aggressive information program is
                        in the support of all our other foreign activities: our foreign policy and
                        diplomacy, economic aid, military aid and all the other programs we have
                        overseas.</p>
                    <p>The President said: “I am personally convinced that this is the cheapest
                        money we can spend in the whole area of national security. <pb n="563"
                            xml:id="pg_563" facs="0593"/>This field is of vital importance in the
                        world struggle. I know that we Americans recoil by nature from the idea of
                        ‘propaganda’. But it is a necessity in the present kind of struggle we are
                        in.”</p>
                    <p>He then asked if I was prepared to speak about the new program. I said I was
                        and talked for three or four minutes, mentioning the increase in Communist
                        radio output over the past 12 months—an increase of 360 hours per week
                        bringing their present total output to 1883 hours a week; also the increase
                        in trade fair participation to 70 fairs in 1955, 17 more than last year; an
                        increase in exchange of persons and in the number of cultural presentations
                        they are sending abroad; likewise their step up in the flood of cheap books,
                        and also in the number of official delegations to and from the Iron Curtain
                        countries including the imposing list of State visits of the top Soviet
                        leaders, who are out on the hustings wooing these other countries with
                        smiles and offers of economic aid and trade, and posing as apostles of
                        friendship and peace.</p>
                    <p>I said that there is an enormous task in getting the United States’ story
                        understood abroad—particularly our dedication and devotion to peace.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Taber</persName> asked again for the figures
                        on the Communist radio step up. And the President asked how many
                        transmitters they have in the Soviet Union. This was a stumper, but I
                        mentioned that they had over 1,000 transmitters just for jamming alone.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked me to speak about some of the specific items and I
                        mentioned the roughly $10 million to publicize abroad the United States
                        “positive programs for peace” (Atoms for Peace, Mutual Inspection for Peace,
                        and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ concept of
                        peaceful “change”). I also covered the low-priced book program<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d195fn3">An account of the low-priced book program is in a

                        put 5 and 10¢ books on the democratic ideology into the hands of students
                        and laborers in countries overseas; also the $4 million increase for
                        television activities, with a brief reference to the feverish Soviet
                        activity in this field; also the increases for <gloss target="#t_NEA1"
                            >NEA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> with particular
                        emphasis on unattributed activities through indigenous groups and local
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>I also mentioned the increase for radio broadcasting behind the Iron Curtain,
                        and the President himself called attention to the increase for Latin America
                        to offset the Communist effort there.</p>
                    <p>The President then said: “I do hope that we can have strong support from both
                        sides of the aisle for this information work. I feel deeply that we should
                        have this 50% increase.”</p>
                    <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0594"/>
                    <p>At this point, “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Sam</persName>”,<note n="4"

                        very important.”</p>
                    <p>This positive statement, following everything that the President had said,
                        really buttoned it up—and there were not even any further questions.</p>

                        He told of the necessary severe cutback in 1953. “We have been building up
                        since then. It is in the hands of a very capable man, Streibert. He has a

                    <p>“I can not speak too strongly in behalf of this whole information program. At

                    <p>1. Stalin’s successors to leadership of the Soviet Union over the past year
                        have progressively clarified their intentions and policies, by speeches and
                        pronouncements on a variety of international and domestic questions. At the
                        recent 20th Congress of the Communist Party<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">The
                            Congress was held February 24–25 in Moscow; see <ref target="#d199"
                                >Document 199</ref>.</note> of the Soviet Union the various elements
                        of current Soviet policy were brought together as a systematic program, in
                        the course of a full dress review of Soviet ideology and planning.</p>
                    <p>2. Meanwhile, United States leaders have made continuing analysis of the
                        international situation as it has developed, particularly since the Summit
                        Meeting last summer in Geneva. The President in various messages to Congress
                        and in press conferences, and the Secretary of State and other high level
                        U.S. officials in speeches and press conferences have focused attention on a
                        number of problem areas and discussed U.S. policies with respect to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>3. This guidance is not intended to present new statements of U.S. policy or
                        a new analysis of the international situation, but rather to summarize U.S.
                        views on major problems, and to provide some basic guidelines for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> output, which should serve as a framework
                        for our operations over the next several months.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">a. Soviet Aims</hi></p>
                    <p>4. There is as yet no evidence that the current Soviet leaders have abandoned
                        the historic aims of Communism, or have in any way relaxed their efforts to:
                        a) strengthen the security of their regime beyond all challenge; b) isolate,
                        reduce or emasculate United States power, as a threat to their own; c)
                        undermine, divide and weaken Free World nations, and d) generally extend
                        Communist influence and control throughout the world.</p>
                    <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0598"/>
                    <p>5. In fact, Soviet leaders reiterated in unmistakable terms at the 20th Party
                        Congress their dedication to the aims of Communism, and elaborated a clear
                        plan of action to facilitate the accomplishment of their objectives. Even
                        the current program to downgrade Stalin is directed toward condemnation of
                        his personal acts, rather than to aims and policies deriving from Communist
                        theory itself.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">b. Soviet Tactics</hi></p>
                    <p>6. However, the present Soviet leaders appear to have shelved, at least
                        temporarily, Stalin’s aggressive tactics. They appear to have recognized
                        that these tactics, although resulting in enormous gains in the immediate
                        post-war period, eventually became counter-productive, and tended
                        increasingly to isolate the Soviet Union, and to stigmatize the Soviet
                        regime as a brutal, inhuman dictatorship, bent on world conquest and hence a
                        dangerous and immediate threat to world peace.</p>
                    <p>7. The most impressive of the consequences of this policy of Stalin have been
                        the building up of U.S. defensive strength and the creation of regional
                        defense pacts in the Free World, particularly <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, as bulwarks against aggression, and the broadening and
                        deepening of the political, economic and cultural interests among Free World
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>8. Soviet leaders, as a result of their own nuclear tests, have also
                        undoubtedly acquired direct knowledge of the immensely destructive power of
                        nuclear weapons. It is reasonable to suppose that this knowledge has had a
                        direct effect on their planning and strategy for pursuing their political
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>9. This may result in greater understanding of the nature of the Free World
                        policy of deterrence, backed by the nuclear retaliatory power of the United
                        States, and hence may make Soviet leaders wary of actions which are likely
                        to lead to a general, nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>10. It is also possible that Soviet leaders consider that mutual recognition
                        of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear devastation enables them to take
                        calculated risks which will not be challenged by the Free World, out of fear
                        of unleashing a general war. As a result of the clear demonstration at the
                        Summit conference of the peaceful intentions of the United States, they may
                        also have become convinced that the United States will not resort to
                        preventive war, or provoke a situation which would lead to general war. They
                        may therefore believe that they can play upon the apprehensions of other
                        nations with respect to nuclear war, without themselves running serious risk
                        of precipitating it.</p>
                    <p>11. In any event, Stalin’s successors appear to have turned from his tactics
                        of force, intolerance and bad manners in international relations, to greater
                        reliance on enticement, division, and duplicity in <pb n="569"
                            xml:id="pg_569" facs="0599"/>pursuit of their aims. Greater emphasis is
                        now being placed on peaceful gestures, on economic and political penetration
                        aimed at subversion, and on parliamentary maneuver as standard techniques
                        for extending the influence and power of Communism.</p>
                    <p>12. The possibility of violent measures to achieve the goals of Communism has
                        not, however, been entirely abandoned. At the 20th Party Congress, it was
                        made specifically clear that force may be required in certain situations,
                        where resistance is strong and the possibilities of Communist success are
                        believed to be good. This undoubtedly is meant to cover situations such as
                        local aggression and revolutionary seizure of power by local Communist
                        groups, where intervention by outside powers is considered minimal, and
                        where the risks of precipitating developments leading to nuclear war are
                        considered slight.</p>
                    <p>13. The new tactics of the Soviets have expressed themselves in a series of
                        moves over the past year, which have been aimed at impressing the world with
                        the peaceful intent of the Soviet Union and removing the stigma of barbarism
                        from the regime; in short, giving it a certain respectability abroad. These
                        moves have included the negotiation of the Austrian State Treaty,<note n="3"

                        disarmament, treaties of friendship and the like. Soviet leaders have also
                        made offers of technical assistance to newly developing countries, such as
                        India and Burma, or have offered loans as in the case of Afghanistan, and
                        they have agreed to take surplus cotton from Egypt, surplus rice from Burma
                        and, generally, to expand their trade with other countries, with the evident
                        aim of intensifying and exploiting natural rivalries and conflicts of
                        interest. One important aspect of this campaign has been the element of
                        surprise or unexpectedness, which has insured maximum impact abroad.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">c. Soviet Confidence</hi></p>
                    <p>14. Recent Soviet activities, including the 20th Party Congress, have
                        radiated a vast confidence in the ability of the Soviet Union and the
                        Communist Bloc to achieve their aims by means of their new approach.
                        Confidence, even arrogance, has been displayed at past Communist congresses,
                        but the recent meeting and the boasts <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570"
                            facs="0600"/>made there must be weighed in the light of a) the
                        impressive technological advances achieved in recent years by the Soviet
                        Union, b) the effective consolidation of Communist control over nearly a
                        billion people, c) the highly favorable impact made upon newly-developing
                        countries by the material achievements of the Soviet Union, and d) rising
                        anti-colonialist, anti-Western nationalism in various Asian and African
                        areas which have only recently achieved, or are still struggling for,
                        national independence.</p>
                    <p>15. The Soviets have also introduced a significant factor into the situation
                        by entering into special bi-lateral trade agreements with certain Asian
                        countries, and by supporting one side against the other in area disputes
                        (e.g., India against Pakistan on Kashmir; Afghanistan against Pakistan on
                        Pushtunistan; the Arabs against Israel). In a sense the Soviets are now
                        challenging the U.S. on a level which is quite removed from the central
                        issue, i.e., Communism vs. Freedom. They are now in effect appealing to key
                        Asian countries on the grounds that they have a better specific prescription
                        for the nationalist and irridentist claims of these countries than we do.
                        Thus the ideological and subversive hand is concealed under the glove of
                        old-fashioned big power diplomacy. Although this may result in certain
                        short-term political advantages for the USSR, it may also have the ultimate
                        effect of undermining its posture in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        as a great power ostensibly dedicated to the preservation of peace.</p>
                    <p>16. Because of their close control over the productive capacity of the entire
                        Communist bloc, it may also be assumed that Communist leaders, if they so
                        desire, can substantially fulfill any specific economic commitment they may
                        wish to make to other countries. This may have to be done, however, at the
                        expense of consumers in Communist bloc countries, or by slowing down
                        performance on normal trade patterns.</p>
                    <p>17. The new Soviet tactics and their appeal to large numbers of people abroad
                        pose new problems for the Free World, which can only be met by consistent
                        pursuit of our own positive aims, while minimizing the effects of Soviet
                        moves.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">d. The New Soviet Image</hi></p>
                    <p>18. The image of the Soviet Union, which its leaders are now attempting to
                        project abroad, is that of a strong but peaceful regime, which has broken
                        with the unsavory period of Stalin, providing adequately for its citizens’
                        welfare at home, with the governmental organs, particularly its police arm,
                        operating under acceptable rules of law, a regime aligned with the
                        aspirations of newly-developing areas, and tolerant of a variety of
                        political faiths and methods.</p>
                    <p>19. This image was bolstered at the 20th Party Congress by the elaboration of
                        a number of basic principles, now clothed with the <pb n="571"
                            xml:id="pg_571" facs="0601"/>authority of Lenin, chief among which are:
                        a) collective leadership, guaranteeing against the return of one-man
                        dictatorship; b) concentration upon the problems of underdeveloped areas as
                        representing the effective balance of future world power; c) the recognition
                        of roads to socialism other than that traveled by the Soviet Union, and d)
                        the possibility of “peaceful coexistence,” i.e., the achievement of a
                        Communist world without major war.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">e. United States Aims</hi></p>
                    <p>20. The aims of U.S. foreign policy may be summarized as a) the maintenance
                        of peace by the deterrence of war and aggression; b) the political and
                        economic strengthening of the Free World nations and of their will to resist
                        aggression and subversion; c) the encouragement of developments in the
                        Communist bloc which will bring about greater internal liberalization of the
                        system and lead to policies and actions less dangerous to world peace; d)
                        exposing and frustrating the aims of international Communism, and reducing
                        and destroying its influence, and e) promoting peaceful change generally, by
                        which progress can be made toward a more secure, stable and productive
                        future for the world.</p>
                    <p>21. These are not aggressive aims; they are in the interest of the people of
                        the United States, but they are also in the interest of peoples all over the
                        globe. We are not striving for military domination over other countries nor
                        conspiring to force our pattern of life upon them. The kind of future world
                        the United States seeks to bring about is one of peace and progress, of
                        security and freedom for all mankind, achieved by joint effort and common
                        agreement, a world in which the liberty, the dignity and the well-being of
                        the individual, and not his enslavement and regimentation, are the true
                        concern of governments.</p>
                    <p>22. The accomplishment of these aims requires imaginative planning and a
                        flexible program of constructive measures, which are aimed at continuing,
                        substantive progress, and not at mere propaganda victories. As the President
                        said in his State of the Union Message: “We must be prepared to meet the
                        current tactics which pose a dangerous, though less obvious threat. At the
                        same time, our policy must be dynamic as well as flexible, designed
                        primarily to forward the achievement of our objectives rather than to meet
                        each shift and change on the Communist front.”<note n="7" xml:id="d197fn7"

                    <p>23. The considerations sketched in the foregoing paragraphs place a special

                        policies, with the aim of obtaining maximum continuing impact. We should
                        seek to dramatize in every possible way the past and continuing U.S. and
                        Free World record of accomplishment.</p>
                    <p>24. Guidance on many specific aspects of U.S. policies have already been sent
                        to the field, and new guidances will be issued as developments warrant. The
                        information lines they set forth should be used to support each other, and

                    <p>25. In interpreting United States policies and actions to foreign audiences,
                        the United States Information Agency should, in general, seek to: a) project
                        an image of the United States which reflects the fundamentally peaceful
                        intent of U.S. policies, while making clear our determination to resist
                        aggression; b) delineate those important aspects of U.S. life, culture and
                        institutions which facilitate understanding of the policies and objectives
                        of the U.S.; c) expose Communist aims and adequately counter Soviet and
                        Communist propaganda; d) persuade foreign peoples that U.S. policies will
                        actually aid the achievement of their legitimate national objectives and
                        aspirations; e) encourage evolutionary change in the Soviet system, along
                        lines consistent with U.S. security objectives and the legitimate
                        aspirations of the peoples of the USSR; and f) assure the satellite peoples
                        of the continuing interest of the U.S. in the peaceful restoration of their
                        independence and political freedom.<note n="8" xml:id="d197fn8">This

                            materially strengthened. U.S. policies and actions should be presented
                            in a manner which will advance U.S. objectives, and their psychological

                        be objective, calm and confident. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> has said: “We should act in the general assurance

                        stress of our output should therefore be on our confidence that the “wave of
                        the future” will be the solid, substantial progress of free people, making
                        their decisions freely, and not the Communist program of material change
                        systematically brought about by force, terror and spiritual regimentation of
                        human beings on a vast, unprecedented scale. We should not give the
                        impression of worry or panic at Communist moves, however new or unexpected
                        they may be. At the same time, we should not treat serious developments
                        lightly, or downgrade their importance by “slick” propagandistic
                        interpretations. We should not give the impression of sacrificing moral
                        principles to expediency, and should pursue vigorously our attack on
                        international communism, without however engaging in invective or polemics.
                        Wherever feasible and useful, we should use the indirect approach and allow
                        our friends abroad to make our points for us. The specific stress on each of
                        the foregoing elements may be modified, as appropriate, on a regional basis,
                        within the overall limits set forth above.</p>

                    <p>27. In utilizing announced policies and actions of the United States and its
                        Free World Allies, and other appropriate newspegs for our output, we should
                        present our materials within a basic frame of reference which brings out as
                        appropriate, that: a) the military strength we seek to build and maintain in
                        the Free World is not aggressive, but defensive in nature; b) we do not
                        intend to provoke violence or war, but to deter resort to force by others;
                        c) the policy of collective military strength sufficient to deter aggression
                        is not merely in the interest of the United States, but provides a shield of
                        security for all free nations; d) the mutual defense agreements we have
                        entered into are not merely pro forma arrangements, but have been made with
                        the most profound determination to honor commitments; e) should the
                        Communist powers resort to overt aggression, we are confident that the
                        collective strength of the Free World will prevail.</p>

                        is a responsible and considerate partner in Free World cooperation; b)
                        supports and encourages the extension of political participation by all

                        encourages the development of European unity, including supranational
                        cooperation of the sort achieved in the European Steel and Coal Community,
                        and works for closer cooperation under other regional arrangements; d) is
                        vitally interested in helping maintain the independence of those free

                        democratic parties, labor unions, youth, women’s and professional groups,
                        which are dedicated to freedom and orderly progress and to preventing the
                        spread of Communist influence as important elements in the strength and
                        cohesion of the Free World; f) gives its full support to the <gloss

                        international problems, and g) will continue to oppose the efforts of
                        international communism to penetrate and subvert the nations of the Free
                        World, and to instigate and inflame differences of opinion and interest
                        between them or within them, with the aim of creating disorder and delaying

                    <p>29. One of our major tasks is to make widely known all useful evidences of
                        orderly progress, of “peaceful change” toward increasing well-being of the
                        peoples of the Free World, and to counter the attraction which the material
                        advances made in the Soviet Union and in Communist China and the exaggerated
                        Communist propaganda about these advances have upon certain newly developing
                        nations. Our frame of reference should bring out that: a) free people,
                        dedicated to increasing their economic level of production and well-being,
                        can accomplish these ends without resort to the restrictions on personal
                        liberty, to the system of terror, force and regimentation upon which
                        Communist achievements are based, and without dependence on the Communist
                        bloc; b) the U.S. has built a record of assisting and encouraging free
                        peoples to help themselves, as in the European Recovery (<persName

                        leadership. This fact was repeatedly reaffirmed at the 20th Congress by
                        Soviet leaders themselves. However, they appear to have shelved the
                        discredited and counter-productive Stalin tactics of threat, intimidation,
                        overt aggression, and intolerance of other ideologies and systems of
                        government and are making great efforts to convince other peoples of the
                        respectability of their regime. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said on April 3, 1956: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Soviet rulers know that the brutal and arbitrary rule of the
                                Stalin era led to a great yearning by the subject peoples for
                                legality and for personal security; for tolerance of differences of
                                opinion, and for government genuinely dedicated to the welfare of
                                the governed. Also the Soviet rulers must now see that their foreign
                                policies encounter effective resistance when they are identified
                                with the use of violence.”<note n="11" xml:id="d197fn11">The

                    <p>31. Soviet leaders have also specifically recognized that the hitherto sacred
                        dogma of the “inevitability of war” between the communist and the
                        non-Communist systems must be abandoned in the face of their growing
                        knowledge of the power of nuclear weapons, and of the obvious conflict of
                        this dogma with their propaganda for peaceful coexistence. They confess to
                        mistakes in past assessments of political and economic developments abroad,
                        and now grudgingly admit that significant economic progress to which they
                        now want access is being made under systems other than their own. But there
                        has been no public wavering in their devotion to the basic aims of
                        Communism.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">g. Flexible Tactics</hi></p>
                    <p>32. We may point out that in pursuance of these basic aims, the Soviet
                        leaders have over the past year adopted increasingly flexible tactics, which
                        they believe more likely today to result in success than would the
                        discredited Stalinist approach. More emphasis is being placed on a) cultural
                        presentations; b) economic and political penetration; c) instigation and
                        exploitation of divisions and rivalries among Free World nations; c) [<hi

                        front” activities as general techniques; d) the extension of their
                        long-standing “peace” campaign to include special gestures, such as their
                        disarmament proposals, the announced reduction <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576"

                        tailored to appeal to the profound desire for peace among the peoples of the
                        world but do not represent any real contribution to peace; e) overtures to
                        countries with neutralist leanings aimed at preventing their active
                        association or collaboration with the Western Powers, and f) blatant resort
                        to anti-colonial propaganda. These tactics clearly pose new problems to the
                        Free World, which admittedly may be more difficult to meet than many of the
                        aggressive Cold War actions of the Soviets, because they are less likely to
                        give rise to clearly identifiable crises between the Communist bloc and the
                        Free World, and are deliberately tailored to achieve maximum impact upon a
                        variety of dissatisfied groups abroad. We should make every effort to expose
                        the real nature of such Soviet activities and contrast them with the actions
                        required to reach genuine solutions to world problems.</p>

                    <p>33. We do not however reject the possibility of genuine change coming about
                        in Communist actions and policies which will lead to greater internal
                        liberalization, and to more normal conduct in international relations. As
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, in his speech of
                        February 26, 1956, said: “We do not assume fatalistically that there can be
                        no evolution within Russia, or that Russia’s rulers will always be
                        predatory. Some day Russia will be governed by men who will put the welfare
                        of the Russian people above world conquest. It is our basic policy to
                        advance the coming of that day.”<note n="13" xml:id="d197fn13">The complete
                            text of the address is <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> March 5, 1956, pp.
                            363–367.</note></p>
                    <p>34. As to current Soviet conduct and policy, we should take as basic guidance
                        the statement by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on
                        April 3, 1956: “The essential question is this: Are the Soviet rulers now
                        attacking the basic causes of this domestic discontent and foreign distrust,
                        or is their purpose merely to allay this discontent and distrust by blaming
                        them on the past? The down-grading of Stalin does not of itself demonstrate
                        that the Soviet regime has basically changed its domestic or foreign
                        policies. The present rulers have, to be sure, somewhat modified or masked
                        the harshness of their policies. But a dictatorship is a dictatorship
                        whether it be that of one man or several. And the new Five Year Plan shows a
                        continuing purpose to magnify the might of the Soviet State at the expense
                        of the well-being of most of the people who are ruled.</p>
                    <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0607"/>
                    <p>35. “In the field of foreign policy, the Soviet rulers have taken a few
                        forward steps, notably the belated liberation of Austria. But they continue
                        other predatory policies. They forcibly hold East Germany detached from
                        Germany as a whole. The East European nations are still subjugated by Soviet
                        rule. They have not renounced their efforts to subvert free governments. In
                        Asia the present Soviet rulers seek to stir up bitterness and, in the Near
                        East, increase the danger of hostilities. In the Far East they are seeking
                        to coerce Japan to accept a peace treaty on Soviet terms. These and other
                        current actions fall far short of the accepted code of international
                        conduct.</p>
                    <p>36. “Nevertheless, the fact that the Soviet rulers now denounce much of the
                        past gives cause for hope, because it demonstrates that liberalizing
                        influences from within and without can bring about peaceful change. If the
                        Free World retains its strength, its faith and unity, then subversion cannot
                        win where force and brutality failed. And the yearnings of the subject
                        peoples are not to be satisfied merely by a rewriting of past history. Thus
                        we can hope for ultimate changes more fundamental than any that have so far
                        been revealed. The United States, and indeed all the free nations, will
                        eagerly welcome the coming of that day.”</p>
                    <p>37. We should continue to expose the conspiratorial nature of international
                        communism, its widespread subversive network, and its insidious penetration
                        of Free World organizations. We should make clear that the international
                        communist movement is often made the vehicle of activities in a particular
                        country with which the Soviet Government has exchanged solemn commitments to
                        refrain from “interference in internal affairs.”</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">i. The Free World Posture</hi></p>
                    <p>38. Even if the present leadership of the Soviet is sincere in its desire for
                        genuine change in Communist policies, there is no assurance that it will not
                        revert to a more dangerous course of policy. There have been many changes in
                        the Communist line during the past forty years, and only time and experience
                        will answer the question of the permanency of the present approach.</p>
                    <p>39. In any event, evolutionary change in Communist conduct and policies,
                        which makes it less dangerous to the peace and liberties of the world, is
                        not likely to be furthered by Free World policies which stem from relaxation
                        and neutralism. Desirable changes are more likely to result if Soviet
                        leadership is convinced that the Free World nations are a) steadfastly
                        maintaining their defensive military strength against the possibility of a
                        reversal of Communist tactics; b) determined to maintain their freedom
                        against subversion while actively developing their capacity to provide
                        political security and a high degree of economic wellbeing to their peoples;
                        and c) steadily <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0608"/>extending and
                        deepening the political, economic, cultural and spiritual interests which
                        hold them together, in a manner which does not threaten the legitimate
                        interests and aspirations of the Soviet people.</p>

                    <p>7. A distinction is being made between the U.S. official line and other U.S.
                        means to exploit the campaign.</p>
                    <p>8. Publicly, U.S. media are adopting a note of cautious skepticism, calling
                        upon the Soviet leaders to demonstrate their professed attachment to reform
                        by correcting still outstanding major abuses in domestic and foreign
                        politics. For the time being, an attitude of jubilation over communist
                        embarrassment is being avoided in order to obviate a counter-productive
                        reaction which might cause the communists to close their ranks. In order to
                        stimulate and maintain the momentum of the effects of the campaign without
                        directly involving the U.S., overt media are helping to keep in circulation
                        the flow of material and comment, wherever generated, damaging to the
                        communist cause.</p>
                    <p>9. In the non-attributable field the U.S. is employing its resources to sow
                        confusion and doubt in the communist world, to undermine the objectives of
                        the campaign through ridicule and questioning and to expose the attempt of
                        the present leaders to dissociate themselves from unpopular communist
                        tenets.</p>

                        the contradictions of communism and this is being done wherever possible by
                        direct statement, by implication or suggestion as appropriate to each
                        particular form of media.</p>

                        speech reported to have been delivered by Soviet Communist Party First
                        Secretary Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev during the 20th Party Congress of the
                        Soviet Communist Party in Moscow, February 24–25. The text of the address is
                        printed in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, June 5, 1956, page 13.
                        In a June 7 circular telegram to 69 <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                        missions, the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Director reported that
                        the Department of State, in releasing the speech, intended that the
                        “document should speak for itself.” He instructed the posts to disseminate,
                        as appropriate, materials particularly from non-American sources that would
                        stress such basic points as, “We can believe present regime has repudiated
                        Stalinism only when it supplements denunciation certain Stalin excesses by
                        cessation methods of Stalin dictatorship.” He also cautioned that “Except
                        for statements by President and Secretary of State, we should refrain from
                        any form of presentation materials which might suggest they represent
                        official U.S. views on evaluation or significance of Khrushchev speech.”

                    <p>At the request of your office, following is a brief résumé of the action
                        taken by the Department concerning the President’s Conference on the

                    <p>The idea of such a program is believed to be the result of a discussion
                        between Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> and the President in the early
                        fall of 1955 when Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> asked the President for
                        his support for a greatly expanded budget.<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>.</note> The President is
                        reported to have said that he would support such a request but that the job
                        to be done required the participation of the people of the United States in
                        addition to whatever was done by the Government.</p>

                    <p>The first recorded discussion of the People-to-People Program with the
                        Department occurred in Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName>’s conference with
                        the Secretary on May 18, 1956<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">A memorandum of

                        plans were virtually complete. At that time Mr.
                            <persName>Streibert</persName> showed the Secretary the letter which was
                        to go out over the President’s signature calling a meeting on June 12–13 of
                        private citizens who were to be invited to head committees under the new
                        program. The Secretary said he was under the impression that this whole
                        program might have certain areas of conflict with Departmental
                        responsibilities and asked specifically if there would be duplication in
                        East-West exchanges and also in certain responsibility of the Public Affairs
                        Area in State.</p>

                            >USIA</gloss> submitted various written materials to the Department. One
                        of the first of a series of Department comments was transmitted verbally to
                        Mr. <persName>Washburn</persName>
                        <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0614"/>by Mr.
                            <persName>Lightner</persName> on May 23, 1956. The substance of this
                        comment is contained in a memo dated May 23, 1956. (Tab A)<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d200fn5">None of the tabs is printed.</note> These comments
                        suggested minimum press release and no mention of any briefings by
                        intelligence officers.</p>
                    <p>The Department expressed orally some reservations on the outgoing letter for
                        the President’s signature (Tab B) but did not make written comments because
                        the letter was already in the White House awaiting signature. The Department
                        never did clear the letter.</p>
                    <p>All action was abruptly halted by the President’s sudden illness. The meeting
                        of committee chairmen which had been scheduled for June 12 was postponed. It
                        was later rescheduled for September 11–12 and activity began again about the
                        middle of August.</p>
                    <p>In written comments on material which <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        had sent to the White House for possible use in preparing the President’s
                        speech, the Department suggested that anti-communist material be played
                        down. (Tab C)</p>
                    <p>Briefing materials prepared for the Secretary in preparation for his speech
                        at the conference of committee chairmen also called attention to the fact
                        that anything pertaining to East-West exchanges should be referred to the
                        Department. (Tab D) Circumstances at the conference prevented the Secretary
                        from using this material but the substance of it was given to the committee
                        chairmen by Conger Reynolds of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> at the
                        September 12 meeting.</p>

                    <p>The program of the opening session developed in such a manner that emphasis
                        was placed on anti-communist activities. The President spoke very briefly
                        but at one point said we must “widen every possible chink in the Iron
                        Curtain … .”<note n="6" xml:id="d200fn6">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>
                        (Tab E, Appendix B) This phrase was picked up as his most important comment.
                        The Secretary spoke briefly and left for another meeting. Then Lt. Gen.
                        Cabell, Deputy Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> gave a long
                        prepared speech on Communist activities and remained for a half-hour
                        question period.</p>
                    <p>It was during this question period that Mr. <persName>Meany</persName> first
                        asked if it is the purpose of the People-to-People Program to enter into
                        exchange visits with and to make contact behind the Iron Curtain. (Tab E,
                            <ref target="#pg_2">page 2</ref>) Mr. <persName>Meany</persName> again
                        voiced his opposition to exchanges behind the Iron Curtain during the
                        afternoon session. (Tab E, <ref target="#pg_5">page 5</ref>)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, representing Mr.
                            <persName>Meany</persName>, asked at the September 12 morning session
                        for an answer to Mr. <persName>Meany</persName>’s question of the day
                        before. (Tab E, <ref target="#pg_9">page 9</ref>) The consensus of opinion
                        of the committee <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0615"/>chairmen was that
                        as long as this was not a government operation, each committee should make
                        its own policy on the matter.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the September 12 morning session, Mr.
                            <persName>Reynolds</persName> of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        said it was unfortunate that talk during the first day’s discussions
                        centered around exchanges with the Iron Curtain. He stated that the
                        People-to-People Program does not emphasize contacts with the Iron Curtain
                        and that it would be preferable to concentrate activities in the initial
                        stages to the free world. He suggested that if a committee desires to get
                        into East-West contacts, it should work out plans with the State Department
                        which has responsibility. (Tab E, <ref target="#pg_7">page 7</ref>)</p>

                    <p>[Here follow pages 1–14 of the memorandum.</p>
                    <p>[During an oral briefing by the Director of Central Intelligence on
                        significant world developments affecting United States security, <pb n="586"
                            xml:id="pg_586" facs="0616"/>with specific reference to developments in
                        Hungary and world reaction thereto, discussion was as follows:]</p>
                    <p>At this point the President interrupted Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> to say that Admiral Strauss had
                        just sent him a note stating that moving pictures had been taken of Soviet
                        tanks killing Hungarians in the streets of Budapest. The President asked
                        whether such movies should not immediately be disseminated through our
                        Embassies all over the world. Mr. <persName>Streibert</persName> answered
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> was already engaged in doing
                        precisely this, and was trying to get the story out just as fast as it
                            could.<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">An account of U.S. efforts to obtain

                            511.005/11–1956)</note> The President said it would be a good idea to
                        send one of the best reels to Nehru. The Vice President advised sending one
                        to Sukarno<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4">President of Indonesia.</note> in
                        Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> continued his
                        account by alluding to still another problem, namely, how we could focus the
                        violent anti-Soviet feeling throughout Europe on the Middle East and on the
                        Arab states. He concluded by reminding the President that these were only a
                        few of the problems which were facing the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that obviously the main thing now was to get the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police force into Egypt and the
                        British and French forces out of Egypt. This action would pull the rug out
                        from under the Soviet psychological offensive. The President reverted
                        likewise to his suggestion that the moving pictures of Soviet atrocities in
                        Budapest be given the fullest possible exploitation. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> counseled that we not forget that
                        the Soviets have been pounding away on the point that the whole affair in
                        Hungary was caused by the interference of the United States Government
                        generally and of the Central Intelligence Agency in particular.<note n="5"

                                the Voice of America is destroying a great deal of its own

                                the Voice of America in order to get people to listen. The Hungarian
                                record shows that those people listen to the BBC rather than to the
                                Voice of America because ‘the BBC provides us with more worldwide
                                    news.’<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3">In a memorandum of July 8,

                                        >USIA</gloss> Director Larson that a survey made by a
                                    commercial research group indicated that Hungarians fleeing
                                    during the uprising had listened to both VOA and BBC. Of 911
                                    interviewed, 82 percent usually tuned in to VOA and 67 percent
                                    to BBC. According to the survey, the better educated preferred
                                    BBC, which was considered the more reliable of the two
                                    broadcasting stations in the field of news. (Washington National

                            <p>“Because one of your responsibilities is to provide policy direction
                                to the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, I should like for you
                                to ponder this matter and issue such broad directives as may seem
                                appropriate to you. Of course I have no objection to listening to
                                contrary views. But I have been listening to them since 1950 and I
                                am not yet convinced.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Appropriate officers in the Department of State have carefully considered the
                        President’s letter. They have come to the conclusion, which I approve, that
                        the Voice of America will indeed achieve ever greater audience and
                        credibility by following the President’s suggestions.</p>
                    <p>The Department recalls the report of the William H. Jackson Committee in
                        1953, which stated, among other things, “The basis for <pb n="591"
                            xml:id="pg_591" facs="0621"/>VOA output to the Soviet Union should be
                        objective, factual news reporting. It is as a source of truth and
                        information about world events that VOA has value for the Soviet
                        listener.”</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName> Committee report likewise
                        applied this same concept, in general, to broadcasting to other areas as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The Department is cognizant of the fact that the Agency has issued policy
                        directives, which the Department has concurred in, to carry out the
                        recommendations of the <persName corresp="#p_JCD1">Jackson</persName>
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>It is recognized likewise that the Voice of America has been moving steadily
                        toward the type of content called for by these directives.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, an examination of VOA broadcast scripts indicates that they are
                        some distance away from the emphasis suggested by the President on policies,
                        pronouncements and purposes of the United States government, and on news of
                        a character that has world interest and the dissemination of which can
                        assist other peoples to understand better the aims and objectives of America
                        and the progress of the world’s ideological struggle.</p>
                    <p>The selection of news sometimes seems to be made on the basis of scoring a
                        minor propaganda point rather than with the purpose in mind of providing
                        news as defined by the President. Some commentaries, moreover, give an
                        impression of being written to belabor a propaganda issue. The prevalence of
                        commentaries in the broadcasts raises, in itself, a question.</p>
                    <p>The above seems to be particularly true of the broadcasts originating in the
                        Munich Radio Center,<note n="4" xml:id="d204fn4">The Munich Radio Center was
                            European headquarters for the Voice of America. After an investigation
                            of the center, Larson explained his conclusions in a memorandum of
                            September 23 to Robert Button, Chief of the International Broadcasting
                            Service. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>/IOP

                        which have a sharper, more propagandistic tone in general than those
                        originating in Washington. This raises the question whether adequate policy
                        control and review can be exercised by Washington over originations more
                        than 3,000 miles away, and, therefore, whether all VOA programs should not
                        originate in Washington.</p>
                    <p>I therefore suggest that you study the President’s letter in relation to
                        present VOA broadcasting to see: a) what is the gap between such
                        broadcasting and the President’s wishes; and b) what steps need to be taken
                        to bring VOA broadcasting into line with the President’s wishes.</p>
                    <p>I should be glad to have your comments.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Thank you for your letter of
                        June 27, 1957, on the subject of the tone and content of the output of the
                        Voice of America.</p>
                    <p>I am very glad to have this expression of your views, and of the views of the
                        President. They strongly confirm the convictions that I have had ever since
                        I entered upon my duties here. I am glad to say, also, that the responsible
                        executives of this Agency are fully in accord with these ideas.</p>
                    <p>As you observe in your letter, the Voice of America for some time has been
                        working hard to give effect to these ideas. The hardest part of the task is
                        not so much arriving at an appropriate set of principles as suffusing a
                        large organization such as this with a unified set of working ideas,
                        particularly in view of the wide variety of backgrounds and convictions
                        among the operating officials.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, I am undertaking some very definite and perhaps
                        oversimplified actions to guarantee that the policy lines agreed upon will
                        really be translated into action by the hundreds of people who work on our
                        output. I have sent the enclosed directive<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">Not
                            found in <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Files or the Eisenhower

                        our Broadcasting Service, and he and his staff have concurred in these
                        actions and have undertaken to put them into effect.</p>
                    <p>The device of a central news desk will eliminate practically all of the
                        uncertainty as to policy and tone which has resulted in the past from
                        leaving considerable editorial discretion to the various language desks.
                        Moreover, the sheer reversal of the quantitative propositions in the output
                        as between news and policy, on the one hand, and commentary and features on
                        the other, will give a necessarily different over-all character to our
                        broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>The one question we have not yet disposed of is the matter of the Munich
                        Radio Center. This is closely related to the actions <pb n="593"
                            xml:id="pg_593" facs="0623"/>referred to in this letter, but involves a
                        number of other issues and complexities which will take a little more time
                        to resolve.</p>

                        outlined your views on the role of the Voice of America in support of United
                        States aims and policies. After considering them carefully and concurring
                        fully, I communicated with Mr. <persName>Larson</persName> who, in turn,
                        issued operational instructions designed to meet your views.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Larson</persName> has provided for more emphasis on objective
                        news broadcasts with particular attention to believability. He has also
                        stressed that VOA must present news and policies largely from the official
                        American point of view. Features and music are dealt with as a means of
                        retaining audiences so that our objectives can be achieved, not as ends in
                        themselves. Mr. <persName>Larson</persName>’s action is an important further
                        step toward achievement of credible broadcasting. You may care to read the

                    <p>This report is designed to present the status of the <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss> program as of June 30, 1957 and seeks to indicate wherever
                        possible significant trends during the past year and probable trends in the
                        year ahead as they relate to the Agency’s support of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> objectives.</p>
                    <p>Attention is invited to two factors which relate to the information program’s
                        support of national security objectives during the fiscal year 1958: the
                        reduction in appropriated funds and Agency efforts to devise new approaches
                        to its task.</p>
                    <p>In June top officials of the Agency re-examined the program in each country
                        from the ground up. They shaped new plans, activity-by-activity, to redirect
                        emphasis to those overseas areas most vital to attainment of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> objectives. They also reviewed means of
                        communication to peoples of all areas.</p>
                    <p>This revision was made to adjust the Agency’s work to an appropriation for
                        the year beginning July 1, 1957 of $15.1 million, a reduction of 16 percent
                        from the previous years.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">Plus an additional $1.1
                            million to build new radio facilities in the Middle East. [Footnote in

                            million’ to read ‘$95.1 million’ “ and “Strike ‘s’ from the word ‘years’
                            at the end of the line.”]</note></p>
                    <p>Percentage allocation reductions by areas were effected as follows: Western

                    <p>To conform with this change in area priority the following changes were made

                    <p>Re-examination of Agency techniques set in motion a number of new approaches
                        which, it is hoped, will increase impact of operations. These included: <list>

                            <item>A heavy increase in the straight news content of VOA broadcasts to

                                program time for features and commentary. The new emphasis is a
                                direct reversal of earlier content when about two-thirds of program
                                time was given to commentaries and features.</item>

                                Hungarians contained elements which lent themselves to exploitation
                                by the U.S. information program. The spontaneous rebellion of
                                Hungarian youth, intellectuals and working people against their
                                oppressors sent waves of doubt through the ranks of the Communist
                                faithful around the world as the brutality of Soviet repression
                                erupted visibly. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> had long
                                previously reported the record of Communist oppression but had met
                                in a number of countries, particularly the neutrals, with skepticism
                                or indifference. As the crisis developed <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                    >USIA</gloss> moved swiftly to report the Hungarian events on a
                                global front. Operating techniques, worked out during the last 15
                                years in which the information program had met many tests, were used
                                by radio, press and motion pictures.</p>
                            <p>News of the revolt was energetically covered by the American and
                                foreign commercial news organizations. The world was unusually eager
                                for authoritative news of the revolt and it is clear that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> broadcasts and output to
                                newspapers added materially to the impact of the commercial reports
                                particularly in those underdeveloped <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596"
                                    facs="0626"/>countries, including some neutrals, where the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> reports were a major
                                source of news.</p>
                            <p>In addition to its role in helping to put the Soviets on the
                                defensive, the Agency’s coverage of the Hungarian trouble had
                                another fruitful impact of long-term significance. This was the fact
                                that <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>’s reporting of the revolt
                                established beyond doubt the credibility of its output. The many
                                skeptics, neutrals and pro-Communists who had long dismissed <gloss
                                    target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> reports as “mere propaganda,”
                                were now forced by the facts to realize for the first time that we
                                had been telling the truth all along.</p>
                            <p>With the passage of time interest in the story declined and the
                                information impact tended to recede. Meanwhile it is certain that
                                the Soviets calculated various of their later actions and
                                pronouncements to divert world attention from the evils in
                                Hungary.</p>
                            <p>The Agency took action to revive interest in the story. Books, films
                                and cross-reporting were used and particular attention was given to
                                reporting the continued efforts of the Soviets to repress those
                                forces within Hungary which continued to resist the regime.</p>
                            <p>It may be assumed that the Soviets will make every effort in the year
                                ahead to divert attention from the issue both in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere. In view of such a
                                probable course of Soviet action the Agency has instructed its posts
                                to give priority treatment to the issue and exploit the Soviet
                                embarrassment through broadcasts, the press, films and contact work
                                of our field officers with opinion-makers throughout the Free World
                                and with particular emphasis in the neutralist countries.</p>

                                was wronged by the invasion. On the other hand it was equally clear
                                that Egyptian provocations contributed to the wrongful actions. The
                                adherence of the U.S. to principle in the Suez affair was a clear
                                fact which it was possible to exploit. This was done by radio and by
                                our wireless news file which carried texts on the U.S. position to
                                all areas but with particular effectiveness in the Mid-East and

                                was able to exploit the increased thirst for news by sticking to the
                                facts and by stressing and repeating in its output policies of the

                                five-power talks, a top Agency correspondent was stationed in London
                                and received on-the-spot guidance which resulted in balanced news
                                coverage on current developments in both our broadcasts and press
                                output. This work was supplemented by other efforts such as exhibits

                            <p>It would appear that the Soviets won at least momentary propaganda
                                advantage by use of the simple “ban the bomb” formula. Although this
                                formula had a natural appeal the advantage gained from its use was
                                more shadow than substance. In fact Agency polls on disarmament in
                                Western Europe and Japan showed that as of <pb n="598"
                                    xml:id="pg_598" facs="0628"/>May and June, 1957, in all these
                                countries at least twice as many people believed that the U.S. was
                                seriously pressing disarmament as believed the U.S.S.R. was so
                                doing. The polls also indicated that large percentages of people
                                were unfamiliar with disarmament.</p>
                            <p>In the year ahead the Agency plans to give top priority to
                                disarmament. It appears reasonable to assume that the following
                                factors can be successfully exploited: a) The long Soviet record of
                                intransigence and bad faith in international relations, b) The
                                demonstrated sensitiveness of the Soviets to world opinion (e.g.,
                                the Soviet yielding on the principle of “Open Skies” after
                                protracted U.S. pressure), c) The reality and substance underlying
                                the U.S. approach and d) The desire of all people for peace.</p>

                            perennial information problem of colonialism and the aggressive posture
                            of the Soviets and Red Chinese as the only sincere friends of people
                            seeking independence. The Agency continued to emphasize the U.S.
                            position of favoring the gradual and evolutionary approach of colonial
                            peoples toward independence. The visit of Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to Ghana provided an opportunity
                            to exploit substantially through all media U.S. intentions to view
                            sympathetically the legitimate aspirations of colonial people for
                            independence and—where possible—to aid those who have gained
                            independence in their progress toward economic and social betterment. In
                            seeking to pursue this approach the Agency had to combat Soviet and Red
                            Chinese propaganda which proclaimed that American policy on colonialism
                            was insincere because the U.S. was unwilling to offend its “colonialist”

                                for international Communism posed grave information problems. A
                                prime example was Indonesia, a top priority country in Agency
                                planning. Although the Agency staffed its field organization fully
                                opportunities for large-scale operations were limited. Because of
                                the local political climate it was impossible to conduct an
                                aggressive program. The Indonesian Government appears to have been
                                unwilling to allow the Agency to open two additional centers. Good
                                progress has been made in the English-teaching program and this
                                provides an encouraging factor. In the controversy between the Dutch
                                and the Indonesians over who shall have sovereignty over West New
                                Guinea, the Communists have favored the Indonesians and this has put

                                recover from its major setback, the Hungarian revolt, in turn
                                produced other problems for the information program. The Soviet
                                attempts to re-establish respectability in the international
                                community took the following forms: a frequently repeated posture of
                                being the only real champion of peace combined with intermittent
                                attacks upon what it termed the war-like intentions of the U.S.; a
                                series of seemingly benign efforts to penetrate the Free World,
                                notably the Middle-East and Southeast Asia, and Soviet proposals for
                                cultural exchanges with the West. Throughout the year Soviet
                                emissaries and special trade delegations visited numerous foreign
                                countries. Meanwhile representatives of these countries were invited
                                to Moscow and were offered tempting economic and cultural
                                arrangements and in some instances military aid. All these
                                activities produced some propaganda benefits to the Soviets. In
                                particular the theme of “aid without strings” appears to have made
                                some impression on neutralist countries, some of which had accepted
                                U.S. aid.</p>
                            <p>The cumulative effect of these Soviet moves meant that the
                                information program faced last year and will continue to face the
                                following problems: a) The Agency must continue to seek to persuade
                                its audiences that the U.S. stands ready to entertain any Soviet
                                overtures which might possibly reduce world tensions; b) The Agency
                                must continue wherever possible to expose Soviet moves designed to
                                weaken the Free World; c) A continuing effort must also be made to
                                convince both our allies and the neutrals that the ultimate Soviet
                                objective of world domination remains as a threat notwithstanding
                                intermittent Soviet gestures of peace; d) Prudent efforts must be
                                made to encourage aspirations for freedom in the Soviet Orbit
                                without inciting the people to open rebellion and e) Wherever
                                possible information operations must be directed toward weakening
                                the cohesion and vitality of the international Communist

                            example although People’s Capitalism was a global campaign, exhibits
                            were scheduled for use only in those countries where the heaviest impact
                            could be made. However all areas used other media to exploit this

                                    program theme had impact. The People’s Capitalism campaign was
                                    launched in early 1956 as a drive to describe the American
                                    economic system, give the lie to Soviet charges against
                                    capitalism and to prove the falsity of Marxist-Leninist theory.
                                    A central Agency theme is that capitalism in America has
                                    undergone a revolution by peaceful and democratic means which
                                    has resulted in a system whose benefits are shared by the many
                                    instead of the few.</p>

                    <p>The Hungarian revolt and the Suez crisis reversed significantly the
                        psychological climate in Europe prevalent at that time. A year before the
                        belief was that the danger of war had passed. It changed to a sudden
                        realization of the continuing aggressive character of the Soviet Union when
                        the events in Hungary unfolded and the British and French invasion of Suez
                        was followed by Soviet nuclear threats.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of these events the previous uneasiness found in certain
                        European quarters about too heavy U.S. emphasis on the military aspects of
                        the Western alliance turned almost full circle to extreme criticism of the
                        U.S. for relying too much on United Nations procedures and its unwillingness
                        to meet a crisis with anything but peaceful means.</p>
                    <p>Many influential Europeans publicly discussed the questions of whether the
                        U.S. had decided to relinquish Europe and link its future with the
                        Afro-Asian bloc and whether the U.S. had as its aim the withdrawal of its
                        troops and bases from Europe in an effort to come to an agreement with
                        Soviet Russia at the expense of Europe.</p>
                    <p>In this general climate of bewilderment and confusion, Europeans
                        uncomfortably realized that the center of world power has shifted from
                        Europe to the U.S. and Soviet Russia. Since they expected nothing from the
                        Soviet Union but regarded the United States as a strong friend, there was
                        some feeling that the U.S. has not acted as such.</p>
                    <p>This distrust of the U.S. and the difficulty of many Europeans in
                        understanding the motives of U.S. policy varied in strength and degree from
                        country to country. It was strongest in Britain and France, but it was
                        present almost everywhere.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of these constant and sometimes extreme shifts and
                        fluctuations in the psychological climate of Europe flexibility became a
                        prime factor in Agency planning and activities in Europe.</p>

                        missions in this area their most challenging informational tasks. Each
                        succeeding event, whether it was U.S. policy on Suez, the American Doctrine
                        for the Middle East, U.S. support of King Hussein in Jordan, the visit of
                        King Saud to the U.S., or the worsening situation in Syria, required
                        virtually incessant explanation of U.S. policy and motives.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt, a country whose propaganda influence on the man in the street in

                        Cairo engineered a large pamphlet operation to explain the American

                        personal calls at our information offices at Cairo, Alexandria and Port
                        Said. Several thousand Egyptians came in person to the <gloss

                        broke all commercial records for a film of this kind.</p>
                    <p>In Jordan, King Hussein’s success in preventing pro-Communist forces from
                        taking over Jordan led to unprecedented opportunities for the widespread use

                        made and distributed widely throughout the Arab world. The Hungarian fight
                        for freedom provided an unprecedented opportunity for unmasking Red

                        was a major Agency task during 1957. Emphasis in this effort was given to

                    <p>All <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> efforts in Africa during 1957 were
                        made in the face of Soviet and Satellite intensification of their pressures
                        upon African countries, particularly in the independent nations and those
                        approaching this status. With the close Soviet alignment of Egypt the
                        Communist world gained a significant source of propaganda to African
                        nations. Cairo’s <hi rend="italic">Voice of the Arabs</hi> added to its
                        Arabic and Swahili broadcasts, programs in Amharic, Somali and Hausa,
                        stressing the themes of anti-colonialism and neutralism, and exploiting
                        Islamic ties to win support for Egyptian claims to the leadership of African
                        nationalism.</p>

                    <p>In the free but neutral nations of Southeast Asia, the Agency concentrated on
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> objective to bolster the will and
                        strength of these countries to resist Communist inducements away from the
                        path of genuine neutrality. At the same time, in those countries allied with
                        the U.S., vigorous <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> programs were aimed
                        at stemming the spreading erosion in local support of their ties with the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>The two major news events of the year, Hungary and Suez, gave the Agency an
                        opportunity to demonstrate basic U.S. opposition to colonialism and support
                        of freedom. The much greater emotional impact of Suez in Southeast Asia,
                        however, hampered the Agency’s efforts to deflect attention toward
                        Hungary.</p>
                    <p>Despite all efforts, the trend toward accommodation to Communist pressures in
                        the area continued. Communist political power <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609"
                            facs="0639"/>grew in Indonesia. In Cambodia and Laos, Communist China
                        and the USSR gained ground toward local political goals. In the meantime,
                        there were increasing psychological difficulties for the U.S. position in
                        the Philippines, Thailand, and Nationalist China.</p>
                    <p>In Indonesia, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> stepped up its activities
                        to meet the challenge of a deteriorating situation, giving heavy play to the
                        Hungarian Revolt and stressing the imperialistic nature of international
                        Communism. Stories along these lines encouraged local press reactions.</p>
                    <p>In Burma, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> made a few significant gains
                        despite an elaborate and expanding program of Communist propaganda and
                        cultural exchange activities. <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> moved
                        closer to one of its most important target groups, the University students,
                        and participated in the missions efforts to develop trade relations between
                        Burma and the U.S. In this activity Burmese leaders who had become
                        disillusioned with Communist ideology were a particular target.</p>
                    <p>In Thailand, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in direct support of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> objectives, focused its attention on
                        second echelon and potential political leader elements in an effort to
                        garner support for the thin stratum of elite now administering the central
                        government.</p>
                    <p>In Vietnam, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> concentrated on the general
                        mission goal of stabilizing and consolidating the hold of the present
                        government over its population and territory. Full use was made of Diem’s
                        visit to the U.S. both in Vietnam and other nations of Asia. Special
                        broadcasts to North Vietnam were continued with the aim of creating
                        dissatisfaction with the Viet Minh regime.</p>
                    <p>In Laos, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> despite a fluid political
                        situation, continued support of the Lao Government’s civic action program
                        aimed at cementing the loyalties of the population at large and at
                        countering Communist Pathet Lao subversion.</p>
                    <p>In Cambodia, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, handicapped by
                        limitations imposed by Cambodian neutrality, sought to popularize the
                        presence of U.S. personnel in the area and to encourage a spirit of
                        resistance to Chinese Communist aggression.</p>
                    <p>In the Philippines, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> concentrated on
                        minimizing anti-American reactions arising from the continued controversy
                        over U.S. military bases and incidents involving armed forces personnel.</p>
                    <p>In Japan, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> continued to expose the
                        Communist menace and to develop the conviction that Japan’s best interest
                        will continue to be served by close alignment with the U.S. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> cooperation with U.S. military units
                        based in Japan has helped significantly in quieting local anti-base
                        agitation. Despite new strength in the conservative forces under the
                        leadership of Prime Minister Kishi and a generally favorable public attitude
                        to the U.S., there is increasing dissatisfaction with present U.S.-Japanese
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0640"/>
                    <p>In the Republic of Korea, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> concentrated
                        on publicizing the growing accomplishments of U.S. economic and military
                        aid. Popular acceptance and cooperation in the aid programs has grown
                        considerably. <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> anticipates a new task
                        of considerable complexity which will evolve from any decisions made to
                        reduce the size of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army.</p>
                    <p>In Taiwan, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> motivated in part by the
                        Taipei riots of May 1957 has given added emphasis to activities designed to
                        sustain local morale, to reinforce U.S. prestige among the people and to
                        strengthen Sino-American cooperation. It continues its activities aimed at
                        the overseas Chinese population.</p>
                    <p>In Hong Kong, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> continues its efforts to
                        alienate the Overseas Chinese from the Chinese Communists and is supplying
                        other posts with materials on Communist China for dissemination to the
                        native elite audience of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>In Australia and New Zealand, the limited resources of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> were focused primarily at countering a
                        trend toward recognition of Communist China and her admission to the United
                        Nations. Special efforts were made to support U.S. policy as related to the
                        Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>In Malaya, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> continued normal operations
                        but was preparing to meet the changed conditions that will prevail after the
                        Federation of Malaya achieves its independence on August 31, 1957.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">E. Latin America</hi></p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> markedly stepped up its exposure of the
                        Communist conspiracy in Latin America during the past year. Approximately
                        69% of allocations for the area were devoted to activities in seven priority
                        countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala and
                        Mexico.</p>
                    <p>The most important international development used in attacks against
                        Communism was, of course, the uprising and subsequent crushing of Hungary by
                        Russian troops. This development served as a catalyst for anti-Communist
                        sentiment in such countries as Uruguay and Argentina where <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> had previously been promoting wide
                        publicity contributing to protests and demonstrations against the Soviet
                        repatriation drive among resident Slav groups in these two countries. After
                        the Hungarian revolution, all posts gained major ideological and even
                        political advantage in the struggle against Communism through the use of all
                        pertinent media. In Uruguay, for example, the successful Communist drive to
                        dominate organized labor was checked for some months by reaction to Hungary
                        and in Chile according to Embassy estimates, political alliances were
                        affected by it. In Brazil through a locally produced newsreel, without
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> attribution, a nationwide chain of
                        900 theaters showed a variation of <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0641"
                        />the Agency film, “Hungarian Fight For Freedom” and the Fox chain
                        distributed twenty-four additional prints of the film reaching a total
                        motion picture audience estimated at between 16 and 19 million people. The
                        “Journey for the Liberty of Oppressed Peoples,” sponsored jointly by ORIT
                        (Organizacion Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores) and the ICFTU in
                        Exile and strongly abetted by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> resulted
                        in a telling propaganda blow against the Soviet Union and its Satellites.
                        The Hungarian refugees who visited Mexico under this program were given
                        extensive media coverage and their visit received plaudits from labor
                        leaders in the country. The project helped combat Communism and at the same
                        time strengthened the free labor movement.</p>
                    <p>However, while <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> increased its activities
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57, Communist Orbit and national
                        Communist propaganda activities have, for many years, been several times
                        greater than ours and, at least in shortwave radio and in cultural centers,
                        increased at a greater percentage than <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        in Latin America during the past year. Our increase, therefore, did not
                        signify net gain over the Communists.</p>
                    <p>A major obstacle facing the realization of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> objectives in Latin America is exaggerated nationalism and
                        its concomitant economic statism. In the past year, this has been
                        particularly evident in Brazil but was also apparent in Argentina, Chile,
                        Bolivia and to a greater or lesser extent in many other important raw
                        material producing Latin American countries. This attitude, constantly
                        exploited by the Communists, is perhaps the single most important threat to
                        United States security in the hemisphere threatening not only the flow of
                        essential raw materials and our military installations, but also the
                        economic stability of these countries.</p>
                    <p>To counter the evils of narrow and exaggerated nationalism, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> activities have pointed, where possible,
                        to the many ways in which the United States has helped the nations of the
                        hemisphere toward the realization of their legitimate aspirations. In this
                        regard, the close cooperation of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> missions, greatly increased in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57, has been particularly helpful and
                        the contributions of bilateral and multi-lateral technical assistance
                        programs to the economic development of the countries as a whole and the
                        ways in which this development ultimately benefits the individual, have been
                        stressed.</p>
                    <p>The extent to which private capital, particularly American capital, has
                        contributed to the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Latin
                        American nations, was also stressed by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                        in several countries. Particular emphasis was given to this theme in Mexico,
                        Argentina and Brazil and Chile, in some cases, in cooperation with <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Also on the economic side, the world-wide People’s Capitalism program has
                        been exceptionally well suited to Latin America. The <pb n="612"
                            xml:id="pg_612" facs="0642"/>program was introduced to this area with
                        great success at the International Trade Fair in Bogota in November ‘56. In
                        Chile and Argentina, as a result of heavy exploitation of the program,
                        political parties spontaneously adopted the slogan People’s Capitalism in
                        electoral campaigns. Especially in Chile, where <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                            >USIS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> programs converged
                        on this theme, the concept became self-perpetuating with various elements
                        grasping its potential and applying it to their own problems. Thus, the
                        Chilean Stock Exchange instituted a drive for individual investors
                        addressing their appeal to distinct sectors of the population in the context
                        of People’s Capitalism. In Argentina public controversy around the concept,
                        as interpreted in terms of Argentine problems has aroused a serious and
                        courageous, though at times acrimonious, treatment of national issues. Use
                        of this theme was equally successful in Guatemala, and in the Caribbean the
                        importance of the development of private enterprise in Latin America was
                        also stressed by telling the story of Puerto Rico’s Operation Bootstrap. As
                        a result of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> activities, the slogan,
                        “People’s Capitalism” is now established and understood in Latin America and
                        is an effective weapon against economic statism.</p>

                        thought the Pres. would be in a stronger position if he talked more broadly
                        than he apparently has done in recent days. Br. said the Pres. was coming to
                        Washington this afternoon, arriving around 5:30, and <pb n="613"

                    <p>The Sec. said this situation was ruining our foreign policy. The effect of

                        Russians. He did not know if saying this helps the situation. He said there
                        should be an awareness of the effect of all this. Br. said he had gone to
                        Newport and had taken with him the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>

                        very alert to this aspect. There has been considerable in the papers since
                        then. Br. said this was the only thing he had done officially in this line.
                        Br. said there would be continued opposition from the Southern Governors. He
                        said the Sec’s part of the problem would not be solved by this although firm
                        action would certainly help a lot. They discussed the seriousness of
                        situation at some length. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brownell</persName>
                        asked if the Sec. would look at the Pres’s draft speech for tonight and the
                        Sec. said he was not sure how much help he would be on this, although he
                        would be glad to do it if it would help, Br. said Sec. might want to have
                        another rundown with <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> people.<note

                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA1"><hi rend="italic">USIA</hi></gloss>—The Vice
                        President introduced the new Director and noted the long experience he had
                        had in this field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Allen</persName> recounted some of the difficulties that had
                        always faced the information program, then sketched his objective as
                        follows: (1) utilizing more fully the advantages we have in this field, (2)
                        shifting somewhat the geographic focus, (3) shifting somewhat the relative
                        use of radio, press, motion pictures and libraries, and (4) working on a
                        long range basis. He compared in some detail the advantages that the Soviet
                        Union has by virtue of its dictatorial controls, etc. To our own advantage,
                        he said, are such things as the great number of escapees from behind the
                        Iron Curtain, the great desire in many areas of the world to learn English,
                        the quality of our overseas libraries, the desires of students from all over
                        to study in the U.S., the basic principles of American life, and the impetus
                        to be had from private efforts on a people-to-people basis. He spoke briefly
                        of the need for increased attention to newly developing areas, like Ghana.
                        He commented at considerable length on the great variety of languages and
                        dialects that need to be used in our programs. He concluded his statement by
                        promising to work in the closest possible cooperation with the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>Speaker <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> commented that in
                        addition to the things he intended to do he had better have some public
                        relations men on the Hill. Mr. <persName>Allen</persName> responded in terms
                        of the U.S. need for a steady program rather than a lot of ups and downs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> concluded the
                        discussion by commending the program Mr. <persName>Allen</persName> had
                        outlined.</p>
